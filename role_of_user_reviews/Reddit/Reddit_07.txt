4&2018-01-27 05:55:41&Until I m only being notified of replies to my posts comments and new DMs I will NOT be turning notifications back on &C
1&2017-07-15 05:05:49&Notifications should be reserved for messages and comments &FR
1&2017-05-05 13:04:37&I still want to get notifications from replies of my post or comments &FR
5&2017-03-22 08:05:00&For example if you post a comment in a thread and it gets replies you have notifications to go through and clear off &C
1&2017-07-14 05:14:09&Even if I turn notifications off I still have the notification bubble as if I have a reply &BR
1&2017-04-29 09:34:37&I d turn them off but I m guessing if I do I ll no longer get my post reply and comment notifications &C
3&2020-07-08 23:16:59&There s no way to turn of unnecessary notifications while allowing for notifications for threads you re following &FR
1&2017-04-01 08:02:17&Notifications for replies to my posts comments pop up in the bar but when I go to click on the post they don t show up &BR
4&2017-03-24 21:58:00&Another small issue is when receiving a notification it is not clear if it refers to a post response a comment reply etc &SFR
4&2017-01-12 07:27:00&Only complaint is the message notifications doesn t tell you where they are coming from messages comments post replies mentions &C
2&2021-09-04 05:22:18& Literally if you turn off notifications for replies you will still get reply updates no matter what including from people you have blocked &BR
1&2017-08-02 12:33:07&The second most annoying thing they added popular post notifications that you cannot disable that make it look like you have new message or comment responses content you actually care about &C
