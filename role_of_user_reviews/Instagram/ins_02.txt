Q&1&2018-06-04 00:14:50& Now filters out bullying comments intended to harass or upset people How true is this 
C&1&2020-01-08 22:07:59&So I can get hundreds of comments and messages straight up bullying me telling me to commit suicide and threatening my life but when I report them to Instagram they don t go against community guidelines Glad to see Instagram supports bullying 
Q&3&2018-05-12 14:02:54&I feel like restricting bullying comments will just cause more problems within the instagram community 
FR&1&2021-08-13 09:29:15&People who are verified on Instagram should have comments or posts taken down if inappropriate or seen as bullying 
C&1&2019-04-22 05:06:56&People are constantly bullying others and Instagram is allowing those mean comments to stay up 
C&1&2020-01-12 12:49:34&People I do not approve of have been harassing me through Instagram
C&1&2019-06-19 00:21:54& If you are being bullied or harassed through Instagram and your personal information is being put out there for everyone to see don t bother simply reporting the post because you ll get a message saying this doesn t violate our community guidelines 
C&3&2019-10-28 22:15:43&Instagram lets people insult harass and bully people 
C&1&2019-03-04 00:00:09&Instagram helps bullies to target and harass accounts 
C&1&2018-07-22 02:11:02&Instagram will tell you youre not following guidelines when you defend someone for being bullied It s really sad
C&1&2020-05-13 16:44:50&Instagram focuses so much attention to removing inauthentic likes and follows and blocking people from following commenting and liking but they do not spend enough time focusing on the real issues Instagram users face such as cyber bullying being harassed by porn bot accounts advertisements and reporting 
P&5&2018-05-25 19:24:34&Bravo to Instagram s new version update stating they are filtering bullying comments or comments intended to upset users 
P&1&2018-05-20 06:18:26&So instagram is now filtering out comments that upset people
