P&1&2018-10-17 21:42:10&The IGTV is a new form of video that Instagram put out so users can watch longer videos like a different style 
P&2&2018-07-02 01:03:38& Great you added IGTV cool it s all vertical form video and it s possible to go over a minute 
DP&2&2018-06-26 02:35:44&It s great for depth perception and watching movies on the big screen and just taking in life at a glance but really terrible for watching hour long vertical videos on Instagram 
P&5&2020-02-12 04:46:45&I already liked the app but it s my favorite now that they addd IGTV because I like to post long videos 
Q&1&2018-09-26 05:26:36&How come with Igtv it s sill vertical videos 
DP&1&2018-09-26 05:26:36&You finally added a better way to watch videos with Instagram but you still dropped the ball by not allowing horizontal videos 
DP&1&2020-08-11 10:49:13&You already have short form video in stories and long form video in IGTV 
SFR&1&2020-11-17 09:09:48&It would ve been much better to have that tab be IGTV because at least then it would be exclusively long form content oppose to short quick videos  
QA&2&2020-02-19 18:24:49&Version of Instagram includes a new bug that doesn t allow users to watch video in fullscreen or through IGTV 
P&5&2021-08-11 09:49:27&I love the other features Instagram offers like IGTV it s almost like YouTube where I can post longer videos 
SFR&4&2019-08-19 14:49:52&please make it available to have ALL videos into a full screen or to be able to watch side ways instead of having it only available through IGTV 
DP&2&2021-10-21 21:32:00&Instagram is my favorite social media app to get on but the new update where it turns every video you post into an IGTV video is annoying the point i don t even want to get on it anymore 
DP&1&2020-06-24 12:50:08&Still no instagram for ipad come on how can igtv be useful if i can t watch it on a larger screen
O&1&2020-05-31 16:25:59&Watching an IGTV video 
QA&1&2020-02-11 11:30:11&I m trying to share full length video but my instagram doesn t show me the IGTV ICON
