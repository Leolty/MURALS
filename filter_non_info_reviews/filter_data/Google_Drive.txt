len ratingone In a very glamorous digital world that we live in the interoperability between two power houses one refined one just giant is diminishing in value between users 
len ratingone That means Apple and Google are willing to sacrifice all users time in order to win a decision in order to find a mind to service 
len ratingone This is not a fair approach in fact this is just bad business in general as big as you are it means you re dividing classes yourself you re actually making a political stand between digital politics and you re driving users away from each other instead of coming together like everyone needs to 
len ratingone Get it together stop wasting my time hundreds of thousands if not millions of other users time 
len ratingone We don t have much but we rely on you for the unsatisfactory services that each of you are choosing to provide on both of your platforms when viewed from a let s say docs drive or photos to an apple user 
len ratingone I m certain your both at play 
len ratingone But tonight your interoperability choices cost me because I couldn t submit an accurate bid by

len ratingone Please visit the Help Center or the Community Forum for any additional assistance 
len ratingone Recently when I checked my screen time I realized that the amount of time I ve been using Google chrome every day is hours 
len ratingone I hardly open the goddamn app 
len ratingone Why on earth does it have hour access to my phone 
len ratingone This is absolutely unacceptable

len ratingfive Appreciate it 
len ratingthree I overall really like the functionality of drive 
len ratingthree There are just a few kind of UI and workflow things that I d really love to see implemented 
len ratingthree It would be great to have a more customizable storage system where you weren t limited to the different macro tabs like home starred shared and files 
len ratingthree It would be cool if we could add our own to make drive the most optimum file storage system for us 
len ratingthree It would also be great if there was a way to enable those same tabs just in different iterations for different file types so that I could just swipe over to another screen and see all of my starred and shared mp files swipe again to see PDFS and again to see JPEGs and PSD s or something like that 
len ratingthree Additionally it would be amazing if the download functionality was less cumbersome 
len ratingthree I d love to be able to open the share sheet and just have the normal iPad menu system options of saving to files or doing all that other stuff 
len ratingthree Most importantly please make it possible to do things like download and move files off drive in bulk 
len ratingthree There is nothing more annoying that having pictures of pages of a book and having to download and move each one individually because the function of the Drive s share sheet changes depending on wether or not multiple files are selected 
len ratingthree Thanks

len ratingfive  The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness 
len ratingfive Instead he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance Peter NIV ROMANS If you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved 
len ratingfive For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved 
len ratingfive As Scripture says Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame Come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest Matthew For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost Luke God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior who died for our sins D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus 
len ratingfive  May God bless y all 
len ratingfive So very impressive 
len ratingfive Watch it twice I so enjoyed it 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is big daddy over all other online drives 
len ratingfive The simplicity and the easy of use is so delightful that makes your work so easier to do 
len ratingfive Suggestion The app needs a dark mode for a better experience Apple iWork files support Google Drive really needs to address this issue 
len ratingfive Students and teacher use both Google suite and Apple iWork Pages Keynote and Numbers 
len ratingfive Google Drive lacks support for Apple iWork file format and its not able to open then wish Drive team could address this issue by adding support to view and edit iWork files using Google Suite Docs Slides and Sheets 
len ratingfive  Connect other online storages with drive 
len ratingfive This should be the best of best addition ever 
len ratingfive If Google Drive adds this it will be a killer feature because it would make professional work so much easier for those sharing over different storage providers 
len ratingfive  Support to zip and unzip files 
len ratingfive Google Drive definitely lacks this ability 
len ratingfive It would make downloads of large files a piece of cake 
len ratingfive  Addition of Google Assistant 
len ratingfive Google Assistant would be able to perform task like saying Share these files with name of person or create a new folder and move name of files to this folder 
len ratingfive PLEASE ADD GOOGLE ASSISTANT TO DRIVE 
len ratingone Only use this if you have to

len ratingthree Can no longer Copy files directly to iPad or iCloud 
len ratingthree Major restriction that s new 
len ratingthree Always worked before the latest updates

len ratingthree After authentication is complete Google Drive comes up as a stand alone app outside of Files 
len ratingthree Then when I select Copy Move Share or Send to Save to Files is not an option 
len ratingthree The only workaround is to use a rd party file system Dropbox as an intermediary

len ratingtwo It shows a nice interface to find your files but if you try to edit any of the files especially in sheets it fails to allow you to scroll all the rows and columns

len ratingthree So my boyfriend and I are long distance and we like to share a lot of photos and videos with each other 
len ratingthree Google drive has been great for that because we can add them organize them in many folders and comment on different photos videos 
len ratingthree The only downside to the APPLE version of the Google Drive App is that we do not receive notifications of when something has been uploaded or commented on 
len ratingthree Notifications were available on the Android which my boyfriend had until he switched about a month ago 
len ratingthree The lack of notifications on the Apple app is a little frustrating because it can be easy to miss a comment or upload 
len ratingthree So if you plan to use this as a shared storage app this might be something you want to consider 
len ratingthree I have no idea why notifications are available for Android and not Apple but it can be a big downside if you plan to use this app like we do

len ratingone Our teams have identified the root cause and will be rolling out a fix soon

len ratingone Why would I need by default to create and give someone a link to a folder or document for that person to be required to request access to the folder later on

len ratingone For web users we have to set permissions for the link to allow anyone with it to see the item 
len ratingone For IOS users enterprise users as for Feb the date of this review we can t set an item to be shared with anyone 
len ratingone The app is only allowing us to set a file to be seen by people within the organization we belong to

len ratingfive I recently switched from Mac to Chromebook when my MacBook gave up and I was facing a setback to replace it 
len ratingfive I also had issues with Apple s Photo App which for example seems to be unable to detect duplicates and would not give me a good option to prevent my iPhone from getting inundated with all my old pics 
len ratingfive So I canceled my iCloud subscription which by the way Apple made pretty difficult to do and transferred all my stuff to Google Drive 
len ratingfive First of all I was amazed about the power of the search function 
len ratingfive While Apple s search more often than not would not find what I was looking for here I was able to find old docs that I had completely forgotten about just by limiting the time frame adding search criteria and the file format I was looking for 
len ratingfive Within an hour I had found all movies and most important all duplicates freezing some GB of space 
len ratingfive I also lIke a lot the simplicity of the design the perfect integration of all other functions Google Docs and Google Mail specifically and when it comes to writing which is what I mostly do I just love the fact that you simply cannot forget to safe a doc with Google because it saves the moment you type it 
len ratingfive All in all I am very very happy that I made the switch and loom forward to further advantages that I sure will find

len ratingone Primarily when other small business owners under the same franchisor also use the Google drive to share docs and files needed to run operations and keep all companies sync ed up 
len ratingone If Google Drive had a more intuitive folder hierarchy and allowed users to move content around that would make life easier 
len ratingone Yet they don t 
len ratingone Also as I run my GMB Google My Business account I need to post images from the Google Drive to GMB 
len ratingone And guess what 
len ratingone That doesn t seem to work well either 
len ratingone It requires me to download them to my machine to then upload them 
len ratingone Crazy right

len ratingthree This is definitely not a tool to use if you want to create a video upload it and share within minutes

len ratingthree Would rate this higher except I don t like Google as a company 
len ratingthree One thing I will say is they give enough storage in to actually store more than a picture cough iCloud 
len ratingthree If I didn t share files here I wouldn t even use it because I have plenty of storage on my computers 
len ratingthree Maybe when Google decides to actually protect people s right to privacy and improve the YouTube website for mobile browsers I ll leave better reviews
len ratingthree I can never get this app the upload content right 
len ratingthree Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t 
len ratingthree I think there needs to be an upload indicator

len ratingone Could you try uninstalling and then reinstalling the Drive app itself 
len ratingone If this doesn t help please visit our Community Forum for any additional assistance 
len ratingone Where do I start 
len ratingone I ve used Google Drive for ish years 
len ratingone When I started a company in we chose it to avoid needing to set up our own file server 
len ratingone GSuite helped us collaborate 
len ratingone I used it when I worked at Google for a year 
len ratingone During COVID I observed my year old using it on a Chromebook 
len ratingone My partner is a high school teacher working with newly arrived immigrants 
len ratingone I heard her helping her students use it 
len ratingone So I ve observed people using Drive with different levels of experience and for a variety of purposes on different devices in the browser and using desktop plugin 
len ratingone Drive serves the minimum requirements well it stores files accessible from any device always backed up 
len ratingone But my partner s students didn t know their files Docs were even stored there 
len ratingone So they d work on a homework Doc on Monday then assume it disappeared on Tuesday when they re opened their browser and start all over again 
len ratingone My son kept every doc he d ever worked on open as a tab in Chrome so the labels weren t visible because that was the only way he knew to find his documents 
len ratingone Employees at my company continually struggle to find important documents continually struggle to understand the difference between My Drive and Team Drive and folders shared with them in spite of numerous attempts over the years by various people to organize our files in a logical hierarchy 
len ratingone Personally when using Drive I feel lost lacking confidence that I ll find the file I need with the minimum clicks 
len ratingone I know I ll eventually find what I need but that task will distract me from the task I was trying to accomplish in the first place 
len ratingone I imagine Drive as an enormous pile of garbage and within that pile there are a few things I genuinely value and need 
len ratingone Knowing that I can favorite certain files or use search and magically pull them out of the garbage doesn t make me feel more confidence or delighted in the experience 
len ratingone  Hi there 
len ratingone Let s connect you with our support team for help 
len ratingone Follow the link to get a call here

len ratingone Have you tried force cancelling the app and trying again

len ratingone Too invasive 
len ratingone Google arrogance is built into the app 
len ratingone Open when you did not ask for it 
len ratingone Assumes it is the only app you want so that when it pops up without you asking you have to go to the trouble of shutting it down to get to the app you do want 
len ratingone I have to keep it turned off until I m ready to use it which is infrequently 
len ratingone I would like the option of choosing my own app rather than having an app which pushes its way to the front by opening prematurely 
len ratingone Unfortunately many people make the mistake of trusting Google so use this app for sign ups and group arrangements 
len ratingone  Sigh 
len ratingone When kids are out of school this app is gone 
len ratingone I cannot delete files from my iPad and my storage is too full

len ratingfour So I have been using Google Drive and Google in general for a very long time now 
len ratingfour Even on mobile I have access to Google Docs Google Slides and Google Sheets as separate apps 
len ratingfour However there is no mobile app for Google Forms or Google Drawings 
len ratingfour This is very annoying because Google Forms on mobile Google Chrome can get very glitchy same applies to Google Drawings 
len ratingfour It is especially annoying because I use these two services MORE than Google Slides which does have an app 
len ratingfour On top of this I also cannot create a Google Form or Google Drawing on mobile Google Drive much less edit one 
len ratingfour I would greatly appreciate it if Google Drawings and Google Forms could be made into their own mobile apps 
len ratingfour I would even be perfectly fine with editing them in the Google Drive app 
len ratingfour As long as I don t have to use Google Chrome to use these two services on mobile I m happy

len ratingone Google is not here to serve customers 
len ratingone They do not care about the lives and work of those who use their mostly awful services 
len ratingone This is why Gmail only allows one to send files over a ridiculously low MB as a Drive link 
len ratingone For Apple device users this means it almost always takes multiple hours for any video to process and one cannot even open a video file in Photos or send it via iMessage 
len ratingone This is because Google only wants people to use their services and is quite honestly trying to force your life to revolve around them 
len ratingone Drive is also incredibly difficult to navigate and if I am being honest is never used to access Google files like Docs and Slides 
len ratingone While these are both fairly decent services for what they do Drive does absolutely nothing to improve the functionality of Google as a whole 
len ratingone Google should any single employee care about the livelihood of any of its users which is basically the whole of the Internet needs to fix the issue with video files immediately 
len ratingone Can t scroll down because it s freezing Hi there 
len ratingone You can try uninstalling the Drive app by following the steps here 
len ratingone If this doesn t help please visit our Community Forum for any additional assistance 
len ratingone Refuses to print when using iPhone Pro 
len ratingone Keeps going to airdrop 
len ratingone Can t by pass to print google doc
len ratingtwo On my iPad Pro I experience delays frequently and I don t have storage issues on my iPad 
len ratingtwo Many times when my iPhone or iPad are using Drive it deletes whatever just got done preparing for upload 
len ratingtwo When it works it is a wonderful and functional app but it needs more attention for iPad compatibility 
len ratingtwo  Hi there 
len ratingtwo Could you try uninstalling and then reinstalling the Drive app itself

len ratingone How do I delete files from google docs

len ratingone  I was late on a project just because it took this dumb app hours to upload a minute video AND I have mbps mbps wifi Hi there 
len ratingone Have you tried to upload the file to Google Drive using a different network 
len ratingone Hope this helps 
len ratingone  Supporting Israel means supporting terrorism
len ratingone  Google is trying to whitewash the truth about what is going on in Palestine and Gaza
len ratingone There is still no Shared drives in the files app 
len ratingone OneDrive managed to get SharePoint and Team sites in the files app why can t Google work out how to get Shared drives Hi there

len ratingone Check this link to know more 
len ratingone Hope this helps 
len ratingone  Enough said 
len ratingone Don t use any app made by Google 
len ratingone Their privacy policy allows them to literally record your keystrokes as you type a message into Gmail and that s just one of the less intrusive examples 
len ratingone If you don t believe me go ahead and read their privacy policy yourself

len ratingone Need I say more 
len ratingone Just use Dropbox
len ratingthree They make it hard to delete files to clear space so as to sell you their space renting service I like it less now
len ratingone I find it incredibly frustrating Google requires so many different apps be downloaded to achieve a bare functionality 
len ratingone Drive docs sheets etc 
len ratingone all have to be downloaded to do anything meaning it just drains storage space on the phone 
len ratingone I don t really get the point of having a Drive app that doesn t let you do anything useful like creating or editing shared files 
len ratingone This same issue exists across all Google apps they make gmail difficult to use on a web browser to encourage downloading the gmail app Google home is necessary to do all of things and different Google apps are required to do other related things and on and on 
len ratingone I don t believe for a single second that a company with the financial and personnel resources Google has is incapable of making functional streamlined apps with broad functionality and it s pretty apparent Google just wants to bloat Apple devices and more likely than not force users to download multiple apps that will track and monetize data and browsing habits 
len ratingone I would rather and ultimately will pull out my laptop and connect to a VPN with a private browser tab just to avoid Google taking my data out of pure spite 
len ratingone If I wanted an Android I would have one 
len ratingone I wouldn t even mind the data mining Google does if it actually offered convenient apps but there is nothing convenient about needing a dozen apps to do a single task

len ratingtwo UPDATE I usually can access my G Drive without a problem using my phone 
len ratingtwo I have a great WiFi connection and my files aren t available 
len ratingtwo It s terrible that sometimes it works great and sometimes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS WORKING in G Drive 
len ratingtwo I don t think my files are on holiday 
len ratingtwo This is ridiculous 
len ratingtwo  INITIAL REVIEW It s a challenge to find documents sometimes 
len ratingtwo When a document is shared with me it s difficult to find it 
len ratingtwo Then even though I have permission to edit it doesn t always work 
len ratingtwo Also I will attempt to put a document in a folder I am currently creating the folder creates but it won t upload the document in the same task it fails 
len ratingtwo So I have to go through the process again 
len ratingtwo It s a recurring problem 
len ratingtwo I can anticipate that if I m creating a new folder it will take multiple attempts to upload a document 
len ratingtwo This should be one smooth process rather than multiple attempts required 
len ratingtwo Also often I can see the document in a folder I just uploaded 
len ratingtwo It should be visible 
len ratingtwo I have to exit THEN go back in and most times I can only then view the doc I just uploaded 
len ratingtwo These issues waste a lot of time and energy 
len ratingtwo I shouldn t have to go through repetitive steps to achieve being able to view successful upload

len ratingfive Idk
len ratingfive No complaints so far 
len ratingfive Been using Google Drive on the web for a long time and decided to try out their mobile app 
len ratingfive Unlike other apps this doesn t become finicky and slow when used on older Apple devices running iOS 
len ratingfive The transitions when switching between folders and menus are snappy even better than the website 
len ratingfive They don t have to take time to load they re just ready when you are 
len ratingfive I also like the ability to open pages like Sites and Forms through the in app browser instead of redirecting to another app 
len ratingfive With that being said I have a couple of suggestions 
len ratingfive When I want to edit a file it doesn t appeal to me that you have to download separate apps and switch between them 
len ratingfive It would be nice if it could all be done in one app like the new Office app by Microsoft 
len ratingfive Secondly native support for editing plain text files 
len ratingfive When working with small amounts of data I commonly use txt files 
len ratingfive To edit those on the web I use a separate add in 
len ratingfive But I have no way of editing those files on the mobile app like other cloud services can 
len ratingfive Please consider adding these features

len ratingone Everytime I log into my account my computer vibrates uncontrollably and then dies why is this Hi there 
len ratingone Thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone This seems to be a device specific concern 
len ratingone For the best help reach out to your device manufacturer 
len ratingone Hope this helps 
len ratingfive I absolutely love the way this app works 
len ratingfive It helps me store photos videos and more in my files 
len ratingfive I have an old iPad with GB of storage so it s hard to have a lot of apps and store things 
len ratingfive It s kind of a hit with how much storage it takes up but the free GBs on the app are totally worth it 
len ratingfive I upload all my photos and videos and sometimes I download episodes to my drive to watch on the go and it s a super fun experience 
len ratingfive The only problem I have with it is the sorting is a little bit mixed up in my opinion 
len ratingfive I m not very organized but Google tends to mess up some of the buttons 
len ratingfive The shared section for me is a tad messed up but I don t mind 
len ratingfive I can easily access all my files and not worry about people stealing it even though a Google account is very easily hacked 
len ratingfive I trust this app though 
len ratingfive I love how easy it is to use as well a lot of other applications like this are slow and complicated 
len ratingfive This loads quickly and is really easy 
len ratingfive Another thing I like about it is how there aren t any advertisements a lot of other storage apps bombard you with ads and links and offer only a bit of storage before you have to pay 
len ratingfive The GBs give me enough storage to last quite a while 
len ratingfive Some of the things I enjoy about it as well are the make available offline button this is very helpful for on the go experiences when you don t want to use or you don t have any data 
len ratingfive It takes up some storage but it s a very satisfying widget 
len ratingfive  the file button its very easy for me to keep organized when I can create my own files 
len ratingfive I also like how you can change the name and color of the files at all times 
len ratingfive I especially love how free it is and how much storage is provided 
len ratingfive Definitely a great app and I highly suggest it 
len ratingfive  Hi there 
len ratingfive That s what we like to hear

len ratingthree After looking for online storage programs I had found this 
len ratingthree Since I do Video Editing as a hobby I obviously take stuff from my phone or computer and it can easily move 
len ratingthree But today I was uploading a GB file to my phone and the app crashed 
len ratingthree No problem that happened all the time but I noticed that my Phone storage was suddenly full and google drive was using it 
len ratingthree The file was nowhere not even in offline files which is a pretty logical place to put them 
len ratingthree This forced me to uninstall Drive and a big chunk of my phone data was back 
len ratingthree Please fix this or make it less strange 
len ratingthree  Ah let s connect you with our support team for help 
len ratingthree Go here to get a call back here Hope this helps

len ratingthree  I purchased the terabyte plan and assumed it would behave like one drive 
len ratingthree It doesn t 
len ratingthree One Drive will index the directory tree and all your files almost instantly 
len ratingthree Then even while those files are still uploading to the cloud you other devices know they have been shared and will be available soon 
len ratingthree In fact it you try to open one the one drive will prioritize it and grab it first for you 
len ratingthree You can also see all of the files available in the cloud on your desktop without having to take up space on your hard drive by actually downloading them all 
len ratingthree So I purchased the tb plan dropped in about FB of files and waited 
len ratingthree  days later and my second computer still can t even see a list of all of my files 
len ratingthree I need some of these files to build designs 
len ratingthree I had to get a thumb drive and copy the stuff I needed 
len ratingthree Because Google lacks a working index of files and won t let me see or select files from that index to prioritize I just have to wait for weeks for my slower internet connection uploads all gb of files before I can get the ones I need 
len ratingthree It s a bit of a joke 
len ratingthree One drive was much better 
len ratingthree Too bad my work blocks one drive on their system 
len ratingthree I would switch back immediately

len ratingthree Drive is an awesome program 
len ratingthree I love the overall concept and it s been a mainstay in my life for some time 
len ratingthree The reason I am giving it three stars is because of the company itself 
len ratingthree I do not like relying on Google as their customer support is extremely poor and they are data scrapping us all for profit 
len ratingthree I hate what the company has done 
len ratingthree Ironically I shifted from Apple to Google because of Apple s business model but now I find myself back with Apple 
len ratingthree However until I find a replacement for Drive I ll be here 
len ratingthree In summary take the good with the bad 
len ratingthree Know Google is watching all the time and selling your info while you use this app 
len ratingfour I really like it but it isn t like THE BEST THING EVER 
len ratingfour It s very efficient though

len ratingfive This app is so simple 
len ratingfive I recommend it for anyone who is in school work a job etc 
len ratingfive Some of the main things I like about it are 
len ratingfive You can get it on any device 
len ratingfive I use it for school on both of my computers I have it on my tablet and even on my phone 
len ratingfive This works well because if I get a notification from school say from schoology I can go see the schoology notification without having to log into my computer 
len ratingfive This is helpful because I was just now looking at a message with a drive link to it and when I clicked it drive took me straight to it 
len ratingfive User friendly 
len ratingfive As said at the beginning this app is user friendly and simple 
len ratingfive You have all the same buttons you would have on a computer on your phone 
len ratingfive The drive app lets you create simple slides docs sheets websites draws and even more 
len ratingfive Instead of logging into each individual app you can go straight to drive search up a document or make a new one 
len ratingfive In conclusion this app is something that I use daily and I would recommend it for people of all ages

len ratingone  I am constantly inundated with filthy text messages that come through my iPhone text app 
len ratingone I don t know how to make it stop and you apparently have no interest in monitoring the garbage that you re spreading to people who have no interest in such things
len ratingthree It is NOT free Google Drive as another reviewer stated 
len ratingthree Also Google then owns or has complete access to anything I put there 
len ratingthree And if it disappears from SHEETS like it has in the past then you have to log into Google and THERE IT IS 
len ratingthree Really 
len ratingone Why do these exist 
len ratingone The old version was much more convenient 
len ratingone Doesn t help that it completely screwed over my Doctopus sections for classes

len ratingone  Hi there 
len ratingone Could you try uninstalling and then reinstalling Drive app itself 
len ratingone Follow the steps here 
len ratingone If this doesn t help please visit our Community Forum for any additional assistance 
len ratingfour Google Drive is a solid cloud storage solution and has always been seamless for me in managing my data between devices so this complaint is fairly insignificant as it relates to the main functionality however as dark modes have now been implemented for good reason across most apps on iOS Google could stand to add this feature and save our eyes from having to stare at a bright white screen 
len ratingfour This has already been implemented for Android so I m sure the work would be trivial 
len ratingfour I knocked the th star for this reason however as a service in general it easily deserves 
len ratingone PDF files load entirely too slow or not at all says no connection but other apps are working just fine 
len ratingone It s so frustrating I don t get it Hi there 
len ratingone Could you try uninstalling and then reinstalling the Drive app itself

len ratingfour One huge feature missing is there is no way to get a folder property report such as total size and number of files so that I know everything got synced

len ratingtwo Since when did downloading files from drive become not a normal everyday function 
len ratingtwo  Hi there 
len ratingtwo Can you try Send a copy Open in Select an app 
len ratingtwo You may also check this guide for more details 
len ratingtwo Hope this helps 
len ratingfive Let me start by saying that I have never attempted to use another file storage system long term 
len ratingfive Mainly because nothing could compare to Drive 
len ratingfive I practically grew up on Google so I just knew it and automatically used Google Drive 
len ratingfive Everything else I ve tried honestly was nothing to Google 
len ratingfive I would recommend this 
len ratingfive I find nothing wrong with it except for one small thing that was not near frustrating enough to make me remove a star 
len ratingfive This issue is the fact that we can t edit directly through Drive on iOS mobile devices and I m not sure about Samsung or Chrome mobile devices 
len ratingfive If it could be arranged to where we on mobile devices could edit files directly through the Drive app and not through branch apps like Slides Docs and Sheets that would be greatly appreciated 
len ratingfive If not I m sure there are reasons and it will not be too big a deal for me 
len ratingfive As for the recommendations part of the review I would say to anyone considering using Google Drive DO IT 
len ratingfive You will not regret 
len ratingfive It s easy to use free and includes every option you might need for editing and collaboration 
len ratingfive So yes 
len ratingfive I hope everyone takes this into account

len ratingthree Drive is definitely my preferred cloud storage platform 
len ratingthree That being said I don t use Android I Use iOS obviously 
len ratingthree Google you really need to try harder to keep your iOS app offerings as up to date as your android offerings 
len ratingthree I get that you want to try and persuade people to come over from iOS to get the better experience but I hate to tel ya It s not gonna happen in probably oof cases mine included 
len ratingthree Your better bet is to just make them as polished as you do on Android so that no matter what platform your users are on they get the best experience 
len ratingthree That IMO is what a company like yours should be doing

len ratingtwo  Expected much better 
len ratingtwo Drive is great if you re working by yourself or with a very small org but not near what it needs to be for any group org over ppl in my opinion 
len ratingtwo Permission functionality is elementary at best 
len ratingtwo File Stream does not show Shared with Me folders or docs so you have to do some wonky add shortcut workarounds so people can work in Explorer 
len ratingtwo And forget about using FileStream for more than one account 
len ratingtwo Errors o plenty if you don t set folders as available offline 
len ratingtwo In short this looks like a beta from a start up org and not even a good one at that 
len ratingfive It is sooo good because when you don t have it on your computer it is the same thing as the computer
len ratingfive It is very good
len ratingfive Love love this
len ratingtwo Google Drive seems to be overloaded 
len ratingtwo It does offer the capabilities of Word which is necessary 
len ratingtwo The critical mass keeps expanding with so many more of us working from a home office 
len ratingtwo It doesn t seem able to keep up 
len ratingtwo The editing features in my very basic document are often inaccessible 
len ratingtwo I m hopeful this will improve in time since there are only a few viable competitors out there 
len ratingfive Drive makes it convenient to work from my phone

len ratingone Zero top level navigating to see your folders 
len ratingone You literally just see an unsorted giant list of files 
len ratingone WHAT A JOKE 
len ratingone This app is trash 
len ratingone Google is trash 
len ratingthree Works very well with IPhone and Voiceover 
len ratingthree Needs to have an option to rename files

len ratingthree  Hi Jessica 
len ratingthree Check our handy guide on how to rename new file here see Rename a file section 
len ratingthree Let us know how it goes 
len ratingone  Uploading large numbers of pictures is difficult because the app requires that the phone s screen remain awake and you can t obviously keep pressing your phone every seconds just to keep uploading pictures because if the screen goes off uploading of pictures unto my google drive stops 
len ratingone Please let it run at the background or something please it s such a painful process 
len ratingone Personal fix Since the developers are busy adding new features to the app and are not so interested in investing time in making the current features better I figured that if you re uploading loads of photos to your drive and not take days to complete because you can t keep the app actively running without going to other apps or locking the phone here s what you do deactivate your auto lock on your phone and also keep the screen from going to sleep ever until your app load is complete 
len ratingone Ideas Devs whiles you re at it why don t you add a select all option when selecting pictures

len ratingfour Whoever creates the folder is the owner and no one can remove folder but the owner 
len ratingfour So if a team member leaves make sure none of the folders are owned by them

len ratingfive It s Google product 
len ratingfive Enough said 
len ratingone  Google appears to put minimal investment into maintaining their iOS apps all of which have stability problems 
len ratingone Chrome is the worst offender crashing frequently with Drive being a close second 
len ratingone For the past year possibly longer the app crashes on a regular basis 
len ratingone This is especially problematic when attempting to view images in a folder after swiping through a few photos it will inevitably crash 
len ratingone Since the app does not remember which folder was last viewed when it is opened for large folder structures it is very time consuming and frustrating to need to navigate back to the folder that was being viewed before the crash occurred only for it to happen again a few minutes later

len ratingone Google effectively destroyed my chances at landing several jobs where I had a strong chance of landing

len ratingone I use Google Drive mainly to save photos so I can take them from my pc to my phone 
len ratingone On the pc itself it works fine but on the phone the app becomes unusable 
len ratingone It cannot stay on without crashing every few minutes 
len ratingone When I try to save photos from it to my phone it takes min per photo and some photos will not show up due to it not being a compatible file type 
len ratingone All my photos are saved as jpg which is obviously a supported file 
len ratingone If I don t manually close the app after use it takes up most of my phone s ram and slows down all use even just opening text messaging 
len ratingone The app is on its most recent version as is my phone OS

len ratingfour The only reason I gave it a four star rating is because the storage 
len ratingfour I have to keep deleting and reinstalling the app so I can save my storage 
len ratingfour I also figured out that if I make so files offline the storage will go up 
len ratingfour Other than that there is nothing else wrong with the app 
len ratingthree When uploading from the stock iOS photo app photos were uploaded with their assigned name like IMG 
len ratingthree For some reason they now upload at File 
len ratingthree If you upload another picture later it ll have the same File name as well 
len ratingthree Best way to circumvent that for now is to upload from the Google Drive app directly 
len ratingfive It s the best at what it does 
len ratingfive So I think it deserves stars
len ratingthree I have been using this drive for several months now 
len ratingthree Last few uploads won t stop processing 
len ratingthree I mean for several days 
len ratingthree I can download files that are still processing and the download works fine even though google drive is telling me it s still processing

len ratingfour Hello 
len ratingfour I believe that Google Drive is AMAZING and SUPER USEFUL 
len ratingfour BUT 
len ratingfour It s kinda hard to navigate so that s the only thing I suggest 
len ratingfour Otherwise it s really cool 
len ratingthree Great for accessing files on the go 
len ratingthree Not all of the features you d have on a desktop laptop are available here unless you download other Google apps to go with this Docs Sheets Slides etc 
len ratingthree The thing that bugs me is that the files aren t always updated in real time 
len ratingthree There have been a few times when I had updated edited a file on my computer and then went to see it on the app and the changes still didn t show on my phone 
len ratingthree This was frustrating and almost caused me a great deal of trouble when I had to use my phone for a presentation the other day 
len ratingthree Even when refreshing from the home page my files did not update right away 
len ratingthree  Hi can you try restarting both devices and Drive apps on both 
len ratingthree Make sure you are also signed in to same account on both 
len ratingthree You can also report feedback in the Google Drive app Menu Help Feedback 
len ratingthree Keep us posted

len ratingtwo There s currently no way to check the size of a folder in this app or its desktop equivalent 
len ratingtwo I need to compare a folder I backed up from an old computer to the same folder I found on an old hard drive a nearly TB folder 
len ratingtwo To compare sizes I would need to wait a long time to sync to my desktop 
len ratingtwo What a ridiculous position to be in in 
len ratingtwo Seriously considering moving my cloud storage elsewhere right now since with Google I appear to be paying them for the privilege of twiddling my thumbs waiting for a data transfer to just tell me the size of a folder

len ratingtwo I m not dead
len ratingfive  This app has been a very useful app especially during these times 
len ratingfive It organizes all your assignments documents slides and sheets by alphabetical order which is very useful and makes it very organized 
len ratingfive Google drive provided me lots of help to do my work properly
len ratingfive This is a great service to work on all kinds of projects weather it be creating a new Resume or writing that novel you have been bragging about the past year or so 
len ratingfive Very simple and easy to use 
len ratingfive I would recommend it to anyone 
len ratingtwo  Can you add dark mod to the app
len ratingtwo Drive for iOS works fine as a viewer but when you try to manipulate anything it s a disaster 
len ratingtwo Files either open with limited functionality in the accompanying Google app Slides Sheets etc or are downright not able to be opened even if they can otherwise be easily opened on the web version 
len ratingtwo Very disappointing it seems like this should be an easy fix 
len ratingtwo  When I try to watch a video I click on the screen but it just shows the title and if you click on it too many times I exits the video and when I go back to it I had to start back at the beginning 
len ratingtwo  It was a minute video Hi there 
len ratingtwo Let s try resetting the app data

len ratingfive Hi I make videos and google drive helps me send some that are to long to my computer thank you for putting it on ios
len ratingone  Privacy has always been the biggest problem with Google Drive 
len ratingone It was better than iCloud because you can specifically select which files you want downloaded and which you want only save in the cloud 
len ratingone But the home page just shows all recently opened files right there for the whole world to see no privacy 
len ratingone And now I noticed it even shows Google Docs with previews where you can LITERALLY READ THE TEXT IN THE DOCUMENT 
len ratingone That is absolutely insane 
len ratingone How is this possible Google could overlook or miss so many obvious problems 
len ratingfive Idk
len ratingtwo I like this a lot 
len ratingtwo Don t get me wrong there are times when I need this app 
len ratingtwo But it is utterly confusing 
len ratingtwo Half of the time when I am on it it just shuts down and throws me out of the app 
len ratingtwo Also I am used to the desktop version of this and it is very different but you can still navigate it 
len ratingtwo  of the time when I use it it shuts down and my screen goes dark 
len ratingtwo And guess what 
len ratingtwo Back to my Home Screen 
len ratingtwo This is annoying 
len ratingtwo With that being said google is a really trustworthy and smooth company 
len ratingtwo There is a lot of possibilities in google 
len ratingfour  a few features would make it more useful Organizational structure it s very Hard to keep it organized Searching can the search feature be extended to search across several drives that are in my name 
len ratingfour It would be so helpful to be able to specify a number of drives within which the search works

len ratingone I have used this app for years and have enjoyed its features until recently 
len ratingone The kids are now using it to share porn and they can solicit randos from around the world to share trash with zero restrictions 
len ratingone Most of the websites have restrictions but despite access controls on laptops and phone is was worthless because this app opens the doors to unlimited trash with no thought for the safety of kids

len ratingfive Like I said best thing ever K
len ratingtwo Google needs to add ability to select folders to be available offline 
len ratingtwo They have it for individual files but not for folders like other cloud storage apps do 
len ratingtwo Also it is not well integrated into iOS 
len ratingtwo There too many times when trying to access files or save to Drive from other apps just does not work 
len ratingtwo Given how long the Drive app has been around these types of misses are pretty major gaps 
len ratingtwo Either it won t load anything or it keeps kicking me out or the whole app just shuts down 
len ratingtwo I don t have time for that since I use it for work at a school

len ratingone I ve used google drive for almost a year now for my personal email account 
len ratingone My credit card expired recently and therefore my service 
len ratingone When I clicked the renew subscription button it automatically brought up a screen where I proceeded to pay for the annual price instead of monthly 
len ratingone Only to find out I had paid for a subscription on my work email as opposed to my personal 
len ratingone I immediately requested from support that the funds be applied to my personal account to which I was told that could not be done 
len ratingone So I requested a refund and was told no 
len ratingone Support has for over a month been telling me they are looking in to it for me only to find the same response each time I follow up with them 
len ratingone Separately I chatted with them via chat for over minutes to find the same answers no refund no switching to the correct account no help 
len ratingone I ve had start up companies and small businesses provide quick no questions ask help and get google a giant cannot apply my mere dollars to the correct account for which my credit card expired in the first place

len ratingone Just lost what I had here from last year 
len ratingone So confusing to try to use especially with two accounts 
len ratingone There must be a better way 
len ratingfive Google drive is the best for keeping all my documents and slides 
len ratingfive It s easy and I can access it anytime anywhere 
len ratingfive Thank you for the service
len ratingfive So it serves its purpose to have and see google drive but you need to download slides and docs so you can edit on the things 
len ratingfive I m cool with that just i hate that it uses my gigabytes but overall it serves its point 
len ratingfive I made so much stuff with this 
len ratingone Unable
len ratingfive I have about all the photo and gif storage apps and this one seems to be far better than most 
len ratingfive Go ahead and download it 
len ratingfive They Could however improve the speed of upload

len ratingfour  This app is great but the new update on this app doesn t allow me to share a screenshot and upload it to Instagram or discord 
len ratingfour All I get doing it is a frozen screen 
len ratingfour And when I upload a screenshot to Instagram I press the share button and nothing happens 
len ratingfour As I said this new improvement on this app is terrible 
len ratingfour I d be much happier with the previous version

len ratingfour This needs to be fixed as soon as possible 
len ratingfour The sooner the update the happier I ll be
len ratingfive I think this app works very well but I noticed that the remove button to delete a file isn t in its usual place under button and was wondering where it had moved it 
len ratingfive Great app for anyone in the digital media arts field
len ratingfive Glorious and so important as the need to vote in our upcoming election may be the only possible salvation for this grand experiment our precious Democracy 
len ratingone Whenever I try to open a file it kicks me out of google drive no matter what 
len ratingone Trash
len ratingfive Highly recommended app
len ratingfive Very useful 
len ratingfive  Sometimes when I leave a video file it disappears from the folder it s in and I have to reload the folder or restart the app to get it to show 
len ratingfive This probably isn t intended 
len ratingfive Can you guys fix this 
len ratingfive This has been great 
len ratingone Poor auto sync and no manual sync command 
len ratingone  Hi there 
len ratingone Can you try restarting both devices and Drive apps on both 
len ratingone Make sure you are also signed in to same account on both 
len ratingone Does that help 
len ratingfive Really comes in handy 
len ratingfive Google drive helps keep me organized and compared to other apps is relatively cheap for larger storage options 
len ratingfive I eat cheez its for dinner

len ratingfive I like it a lot no problems work fine just wish I could password protect it other that the phone 
len ratingthree This app does almost everything right and works very well especially since uni has currently switched to online learning 
len ratingthree However there is something extremely stupid in that you cannot save folders for offline and must individually save each file 
len ratingthree This is incredibly frustrating as i would like to view lecture notes on my iOS device when i am offline but i cannot unless i go into every folder and subfolder and save items individually 
len ratingthree Why can i sync on my computer but not iOS 
len ratingthree This is a very important and easy to implement feature and i can t understand why it isn t available 
len ratingthree This could easily be a star app 
len ratingfive It s great to have your pics available at your fingertips 
len ratingfive An online Family Album is priceless 
len ratingfive A great way to send pics on Throwback Thursday 
len ratingfive  Like
len ratingone Should have clearly labeled buttons like download and a day late 
len ratingone It s too much of a maze

len ratingone We really appreciate you taking the time to give us your opinion and feedback on the app 
len ratingone We take all feedback very seriously and if you d like to send feedback in the app please send it to Meet Settings Menu top
len ratingfive Great way to save important docs
len ratingfour Does everything but difficult to find things sometimes
len ratingfive Thank you for building products that add value and makes working across systems effortless 
len ratingtwo Main issues is that you can t edit without google docs also downloaded all you can do is view 
len ratingtwo And if you have docs the formatting is weird when you switch from mobile to desktop 
len ratingthree Not interested
len ratingfive Pr ctica App para guardar documentos
len ratingone This App kept asking for a review 
len ratingone I didn t want to 
len ratingone Now they get one star 
len ratingtwo Google apps consistently have bug fixes and performance improvements as the reason for an update and rarely provide real details 
len ratingtwo Negative stars for the lack of details 
len ratingfive Best Storage Keeper 
len ratingthree Sometimes this app make my life so much easier I love it 
len ratingthree But not right now 
len ratingthree  Hi there 
len ratingthree Could you try uninstalling and then reinstalling Drive app itself 
len ratingthree Follow the steps here 
len ratingthree If this doesn t help please visit our Community Forum for any additional assistance 
len ratingthree Hi there 
len ratingthree If you 
len ratingfive I m glad that it allows you to be able to send a video of yourself and your family to friends and family
len ratingfive Super easy to use in navigate
len ratingfive It saves automatically so way better than Microsoft word
len ratingfive We now have the availability to save to a very small device written text that we can carry with us and access any time we want now that s a blessing 
len ratingfour Let me start by saying the app is great the only thing I wish you can add is a better video player 
len ratingfour The ability to rewind forward would be great when watching video movie on my google drive that I previously uploaded 
len ratingfive I regard it as equal if not better than Microsoft Office 
len ratingfive I argue Google Drive is better because it s free and has seamless integration with almost any business related work you ll ever need done 
len ratingfive I love this so much
len ratingfive So organized for school I love 
len ratingfive I can trust Google Services
len ratingfive I love everything about it 
len ratingfive All my files are stored well and secure I have nothing to worry about 
len ratingtwo It was working well but after the recent update there are lots of issues when switching between different students accounts 
len ratingtwo The app freezes won t switch or icon says it has switched but the files belong to someone else 
len ratingtwo All of these seem to revolve around students not being able to log out of google accounts 
len ratingfive  Pp poo poo time pp poopoo eee eee ooooo
len ratingfive It s a great app for files and to do school work
len ratingthree It works fine for storing documents and such but it is absolute trash when it comes to watching any video on it
len ratingfive Excellent app and easy to use
len ratingone Slower than joe Biden 
len ratingone  Offf
len ratingfive It s great for sharing with my family
len ratingfive Google drive is good but crashes when accessing photos in google drive 
len ratingone Worthless app 
len ratingthree It is a serviceable app for file management and flips between accounts easily but the constant demand to download other apps to open every file type is unfortunate and annoying 
len ratingthree  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingthree You can also send it here Google Drive app Menu Help Feedback 
len ratingthree Appreciate it 
len ratingthree  As a small business owner I have a G Suite account and Google Drive comes with that 
len ratingthree However I still pay for Dropbox because I find it is a better solution for work and there are some annoyances I find with Google Drive 
len ratingthree For example I have a folder of product photos in my Dropbox account 
len ratingthree I have this set to offline on my iPad so I can show customers photos without an internet connection 
len ratingthree There is no way in Google Drive to make a folder available offline 
len ratingthree You have to select offline for each file individually 
len ratingthree Can you imagine doing this with dozens or s of photos 
len ratingthree How about when I add a new photo 
len ratingthree I would need to remember to make it available offline 
len ratingthree That is just inconvenient and not well thought out 
len ratingthree I think many of the reviews on here don t have experience with other storage services 
len ratingthree I think Dropbox has an advantage in that their business is storage and they are focused on that 
len ratingthree Google on the other hand has their focus spread between many different businesses 
len ratingthree I wish Google would focus on their Drive product and make it on par or even better than Dropbox 
len ratingthree It would save me a year 
len ratingfive Tr s joli comme application
len ratingone Cant run app longer than minutes 
len ratingone Always have used drive but called the service line and the employees had zero clue how the app even worked 
len ratingone Google is impossible to reach on the phone 
len ratingone The app worked two years ago

len ratingfive Love Google Drive 
len ratingfive However I would like to see the ability to have Dark Mode 
len ratingfour  This app is great but the new update on this app doesn t allow me to share a screenshot and upload it to Instagram or discord 
len ratingfour All I get doing it is a frozen screen 
len ratingfour And when I upload a screenshot to Instagram I press the share button and nothing happens 
len ratingfour As I said this new improvement on this app is terrible 
len ratingfour I d be much happier with the previous version 
len ratingfour So this needs to be fixed as soon as possible 
len ratingfour Not to mention there is a bug in this update which doesn t allow me to share screenshots to Instagram or discord

len ratingfive Excellent easy to use
len ratingtwo I cant figure out how to draw with my iPad I don t think the app lets you on the computer or pc version 
len ratingtwo This is why i give this stars 
len ratingtwo I have an apple pen and that should be x better then using the little touch screen mouse for the key bored 
len ratingtwo I have a statistics math class with a teacher who wants us to how out work 
len ratingtwo I would much rather draw it on my iPad then on the computer 
len ratingtwo I m not even drawing on the computer I m just taking screen shots with my phone and posting them 
len ratingtwo It would be so much more efficient and faster if i could just take my iPad whenever in need a drawing and draw it into the google docs 
len ratingtwo But i cant do that 
len ratingtwo I tried to download google drive to see if that would work with what i was trying to do because again you can draw whatever you need on the computer on drive but not the iPad 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo It just seems stupid 
len ratingtwo Honestly it would make more sense if you could draw on the iPad but NOT the computer I d at least understand that 
len ratingtwo Anyway please flick this problem it makes me upset 
len ratingtwo Thank you for your time

len ratingfive It is very easy to help me save stuff and have storage 
len ratingthree very slow but gets the job done
len ratingthree I ll say you need to get drive sheets slides and docs for it to work 
len ratingthree But drive can only view not edit 
len ratingthree So 
len ratingtwo I ve used Microsoft for over years 
len ratingtwo Getting used to Google docs has been very hard 
len ratingtwo When my kids were in school they introduced me to Google docs several years ago 
len ratingtwo It was convenient to post and share files but I am not a fan 
len ratingtwo I hope Google will continue to improve maneuverability ease of use 
len ratingtwo It s not about how much it looks like Microsoft as much as how logical it is to move files around to store 
len ratingtwo More logical editing features would help too 
len ratingfive Have come to rely on this app for many things 
len ratingfive Never a problem 
len ratingthree Seems good but need tutorial to understand how to organize it 
len ratingthree Also not clear if last viewed or modified by ME means anyine that opened that email where it was downloaded originally shared business email or actually ME from my cell phone

len ratingtwo Drive Docs AND Classroom could not handle uploading my daughter s math homework with some red on it 
len ratingtwo I know it s the red because we had the same issue in the spring semester with her math homework and some coloring assignments 
len ratingtwo Too much red gives us an upload error or just doesn t load at all 
len ratingtwo  Hi there 
len ratingtwo Are you using Drive at work or school 
len ratingtwo If so reach out to your IT admin or G Suite support 
len ratingtwo Hope this gets resolved 
len ratingfive I use this app all the time to share music with friends and upload my ideas from my phone to chop up and use in Studio One

len ratingfive That is amazing what you guys are doing God bless all of you amp keep you safe amp healthy
len ratingone Deletes all information
len ratingfive Great free so
len ratingthree Excel sheets done show up properly 
len ratingthree Please fix it I love the app 
len ratingfour The one task I do quite frequently is to move specific photographs from my iPhone into designated folders on my Google Drive 
len ratingfour Whether or not I use an existing folder or create a new one I would like to not have to tap through the entire structure of my Google Drive a second time if I want to move another set of photos to the same folder 
len ratingfour It should always retain the folder from your last move regardless of how you activated that move whether from within the GD app or the iPhone Camera Roll 
len ratingfive Its great and all but im only giving it stars because whenever your trying to watch a video on it you cant stop it easily if its on computer its fine but on mobile devices its bad other than that its great but im giving it stars
len ratingfive Reliable
len ratingone I ve downloaded and redownloaded this app which I ve had since high school and all of the sudden it says my organization requires me to set a passcode to access it which it s always had a passcode 
len ratingone But it just keeps requesting that but gives me no way to set this mysterious passcode 
len ratingfive This app is the best it helps me with my homework
len ratingtwo I don t trust these huge centralized companies that can give away your info to rd parties or the government for money or whatever reason they feel like 
len ratingtwo I m now using Internxt 
len ratingtwo It s decentralized and no one besides you can EVER see what you have stored 
len ratingfive Google drive is a GREAT resource for students especially with a limited amount of storage on devices 
len ratingfive It also syncs seamlessly between apps and devices making it easy and generally pleasant to use 
len ratingfive Highly recommend for anyone needing a virtual office space 
len ratingfour The iPad version allows you to require Touch ID to open the app to see your files 
len ratingfour The iPhone version now has this option preventing someone gaining access to all your files when the phone is unlocked just by opening the app 
len ratingfour This however does nothing to fix the longstanding Google security defect that keeps every file you have ever opened in a Recent folder forever with no ability to clear that history or remove a file from the Recent list so anyone watching you open this app at its Home screen will see all the images and files you have opened 
len ratingfour I would give five stars to see Google fix that 
len ratingfour They have received thousands of complaints on their user forums but they have ignored this issue for years 
len ratingone Google has by far the worst and most embarrassingly incompetent customer service of the big tech firms Apple Amazon Microsoft and Google On July Google sends me an email announcing a reduction on my storage costs from to effective at my next renewal date of July two days later 
len ratingone On July I get charged instead of 
len ratingone Cue in email exchanges so far August 
len ratingone with the INCOMPETENT GoogleOne Customer Service 
len ratingone Not only does it take Google almost a month so far to issue me a refund for the overcharge but they cannot even guarantee that I will be charged the CORRECT rate at the next billing date 
len ratingone WTH is wrong with you Google 
len ratingone This is so embarrassing 
len ratingone This whole episode would have been a minute chat with Amazon Customer Service 
len ratingone Shameful 
len ratingthree The app is ok but it s frustrating that there s no shortcut from the phone to save into it or to share a document with others directly from a file in the drive

len ratingone Can t download multiple photos to the camera roll 
len ratingone Even when saving one photo there is no option to save to the camera roll from drop down menu 
len ratingone Instead you have to press send copy option and only after that you have a button to download it to your phone 
len ratingone Google that s stupid 
len ratingone I know you can do it but you won t for some reason 
len ratingone Very frustrating as i use Drive for everything 
len ratingone How is it that a video I loaded into my course for students saved and tested gets replaced when I access it by phone with a short video clip I made and did NOT upload

len ratingthree I ve used Google drive for years 
len ratingthree I needed a system to keep my files in sync across multiple computers and platforms and it seems the best option 
len ratingthree That said the desktop version that resides on your laptop or computer is the best aspect is that allows you instant access using your native apps 
len ratingthree However it can literally take days to sync to GB between one computer and the cloud even when all of the files have already been uploaded from another computer 
len ratingthree That s ridiculous and I have no idea why he doesn t scan and identify all the common files dramatically faster 
len ratingthree Access to Google Drive via the web is critically important and is fully functional for all contemporary file types but online search and organization of Drive is clunky and much slower than working offline especially on a Mac

len ratingthree I hope that Google will work on must to have feature and provide this functionality 
len ratingone Google drive was a really good service until a few months ago when I started getting suggestions in my drive account 
len ratingone All of these suggestions are either sexy singles Facebook accounts or straight up hard core porn 
len ratingone Having these popping up on my account is affecting my marriage and my sanity 
len ratingone The ONLY option google offers is just reporting the offers to them and to select not a helpful suggestion on these posts 
len ratingone They don t even have a setting to turn off suggestions all together 
len ratingone If I could have given negative stars I would have 
len ratingone I am definitely looking for another cloud account

len ratingthree Don t like that I can t edit in Microsoft but get it 
len ratingfive Thank you Google drive for keeping our pictures and videos safe in your files and for easy access when needed 
len ratingthree In the latest update the video player seems to have lost a feature for the timeline and scrubbing forward backward 
len ratingthree You used to be able to touch the screen three times one to activate the file two to display properties like the video title and a third to show the timeline 
len ratingthree The first two presses work but not the third 
len ratingthree Was this changed 
len ratingthree How can I fast forward etc 
len ratingthree As a file repository it works fine 
len ratingthree As a player and library I feel the app is too simplistic such as to not be intuitive to the point above 
len ratingone Why is the

len ratingtwo Tried to write a review and my text won t show up in the blank right now this is via dictation 
len ratingtwo Searching on your apps terrible I can t find anything like that uploaded to the drive
len ratingthree Other than that great app 
len ratingtwo You guys need to create a way to make sharing a file in drive more secure so that spam gets cut off at the gate at least Gdrive needs to send a request notification that we have to approve the file be shared with us before it just shows up like it does currently 
len ratingtwo I am getting numerous spam files every day through shared docs which I have to individually report as abuse 
len ratingtwo Every 
len ratingtwo Day

len ratingone I sent off my folder with video clips to my editor 
len ratingone Next day all videos disappeared 
len ratingone Not one video in the folder 
len ratingone I searched for an answer On Google of course and people complained of exact same issue 
len ratingone I tried all the solutions Google suggested 
len ratingone I deleted the app amp re installed it 
len ratingone Finally I recreated a new folder and resent all my clips 
len ratingone They disappeared too after hours 
len ratingone This is a crap app 
len ratingone Don t waste your time 
len ratingfive Able to save and share then make notes right on the copy 
len ratingfive Used for my Kindergarten class

len ratingfive Being able to save files on my PC desktop and easily access them on iPhone is one of the best features of google drive
len ratingfive  Google Drive is simply unrivaled by other cloud storage apps aside from OneDrive 
len ratingfive It instantly constantly syncs all your images files documents media and other assets across all your devices assuming that device is connected to the internet 
len ratingfive And the suite of services decimates stuff like Microsoft Excel 
len ratingfive Sheets is a light weight more intuitive and less clunky version of Excel except it has almost every Excel formula 
len ratingfive Google Docs is just unmatched as a word processor 
len ratingfive Working on an midterm review early in the AM but have to go to class in minutes No worries get on the train and open up the doc on your phone with the exact formatting content styles and font 
len ratingfive And Google really knocked it out of park with the iPad App 
len ratingfive It s so easy to upload and search for files and extremely important export and share them 
len ratingfive Like how it works
len ratingfive Does not get any better than this
len ratingfive Excelente aplicaci n muy agradecida

len ratingone  ok
len ratingfour We ve used the App since it came out and we are big fans but we wish it was easier to see the File Location in all SEARCH results and also in RECENT results 
len ratingfour It may be obvious to more technically inclined users but it sure is not obvious to us older folks 
len ratingfour Hope this can be made simpler soon thanks 
len ratingfive This is a great extension 
len ratingfive I have used it for years 
len ratingfive It keep important papers document recipes receipts 
len ratingfive And even some photos in check

len ratingfive An amazing app that helps you write documents stories and more 
len ratingfive Recommended by schools businesses and students this app is an amazing thing to have on the computer and other electronics except for the TV 
len ratingfive I don t recommend having this on the TV 
len ratingfive I don t think you ll have a good time trying to type on a TV 
len ratingone It will not download
len ratingone Doesn t play any of my videos 
len ratingone I am getting nudity and cannot delete 
len ratingone This is not what this should be used for
len ratingone It s too hard for me just don t get it 
len ratingfive The colors are vibrate the voices is clearly heard and the messages was well delivered 
len ratingfive Funciona de maravilla y es gratis que mas se puede pedir 
len ratingfive So that one thing is basically a passcode lock 
len ratingfive I heard about it so I searched up how can I set a passcode in google drive and saw a person clicking on Settings on google drive and he clicked on Passcode Lock 
len ratingfive But I dont see Passcode Lock on my google drive 
len ratingfive Some people say go to Settings tap on Security and tap on Passcode Lock but I don t see that either 
len ratingfive I can only set a Privacy Screen but I don t wanna use my Touch ID nor this iPad s password I want to use my google password

len ratingfour  Google Drive has helped me tremendously thank you guys soooo much 
len ratingfour I just wish we had more space for free or a one time payment for a certain amount of space 
len ratingfive Google Drive makes accessing important information so convenient 
len ratingone I keep entering my username and password and it going back to the sign in screen after
len ratingone The inability to email directly from a document is a big negative when trying to simply forward material by email without giving access to the drive 
len ratingone Also no ability to even rename file 
len ratingone Very poor
len ratingfive We use this for our church and Christian school staff great for collaboration 
len ratingfive They have also done a good job of improving their Google apps

len ratingfive Google Drive is a great source to keep your information and files 
len ratingfive With protection and care Google Drive is the best app of google for your privacy 
len ratingfive A super helper for me and clients and coworkers and friends 
len ratingfive Google Drive has been my favorite tool for editing business documents amongst peers 
len ratingfive I use google drive across three platforms on the road and at the office and it works well 
len ratingfive Allows multiuser collaboration and complete cloud protection with much simpler interaction than Dropbox or Microsoft products
len ratingfour  Great 
len ratingfour Could be better though 
len ratingfive Really much useful 
len ratingfive Enjoyed a lot recollecting past memories 
len ratingfour  I like very much but GB free space is too small for ordinary people who have no much money

len ratingone I can t take it anymore 
len ratingone Every day I m reporting and removing more than pieces of spam 
len ratingone I m done 
len ratingone Moving to another online drive service 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfour I wish that when I make new fodder in drive the same fodder would be made in google docs
len ratingfive  Convenient for saving space
len ratingfive Retrieving documents from the Drive is time consuming 
len ratingfive And searching in the drive once documents are placed in folders is impossible
len ratingfive A great application to link with your phone or computer 
len ratingfive So many uses on a daily basis 
len ratingthree Doesn t have all functionality on an iPas windows system 
len ratingthree As I have more and more documents in my drive I have found keyword searches often do not give me quick results as they used to 
len ratingthree Wish this could be improved 
len ratingthree Gets the job done though

len ratingone Please 
len ratingone How do I get this to go away 
len ratingone Every time I try to upload a video it does not show up
len ratingfive Just getting into this at last loving it but I m hoping someone can guarantee me it s secure 
len ratingthree It s a great tool but the reason a give it a star is because it needs some updates to make it more user friendly 
len ratingfive Has saved me sooo many times when away from the office and it s free 
len ratingfive GB is more than enough and you can buy more space of cheap money
len ratingone I am getting notifications from inappropriate people sights and I can not delete them or stop them from coming 
len ratingone What do I do 
len ratingfour This app is perfect 
len ratingfour Except for one thing

len ratingfour HI httnty
len ratingfive integrates nicely with ipados s new file app but the IMPORT PROCESS from there is SPOTTY 
len ratingfive i see a lot of repeat files and it doesn t import a folder well with lots of files at once 
len ratingfive i had to review the folder to see which files didn t upload and do it manually 
len ratingfive then check that all files were transferred before deleting the original 
len ratingfive Google is the best
len ratingfive You must also download google sheet to edit Excell spreadsheets but it works perfectly on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Even the automated calculation formulas I installed on my laptop still works on iPhone 
len ratingfive As I retire and live in two places I m using this storage to hold my files 
len ratingfive A light computer is all I need when I go from place to place 
len ratingfive My information is not computer dependent 
len ratingfour Needs to be N accessible Kitty cat Needs to be
len ratingfive Being able to access docs easily and being able to edit and share on mobile is a game changer 
len ratingfive  A review
len ratingone slow and hard to use
len ratingfive Better user friendly opening files rating files
len ratingfive I use the iPhone video function to record myself playing guitar 
len ratingfive As I want to perform video editing on my computer and the file sizes are too large to e mail 
len ratingfive Uploading the large video file through the Google Drive App allows for seamless video editing on my computer 
len ratingone I received an inappropriate sexual message to my phone via text 
len ratingone Spam and possible virus etc 
len ratingone not happy because of that 
len ratingone Keep it safer 
len ratingfive I never really used this until last year and boy am I glad I tried it 
len ratingfive Using an I pad I wanted a place to save articles and documents and did not know this app does that 
len ratingfive If you are on a computer and save docs to this app and then access the doc from the app on your iPad 
len ratingfive Love it love it and live it 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive  Google Drive enables me to manage and share all of my documents with creative flair expediency and ease 
len ratingfive It also provides a trusted space for storing all of my work research and business communications collateral 
len ratingfive I find it virtually indispensable 
len ratingone  I like fries
len ratingone This is 
len ratingone And we can t even open wav files 
len ratingone And it s gives an error 
len ratingone Atleast tell us that you guys are not capable 
len ratingone Don t give us an error 
len ratingone Being a music producer this is the worst service 
len ratingone Why did you remove my files many of them and personal uploaded ones 
len ratingone I took so much time to find the app to save them electronically just so u could loose them 
len ratingfour Way to be 
len ratingfive Thank you to Google Drive for assisting me with educational needs 
len ratingfive Guarda siempre mis archivos
len ratingfive Thank you attheau 
len ratingfive I have limited space so this is pretty great 
len ratingfive I can save all my vids and pics with no limits 
len ratingfive I LOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEEEE IIIIIITTTTTTTT 
len ratingfive Move over sliced bread

len ratingfive And not just a notepad that you have wherever you are in the world 
len ratingfive The spreadsheet is as good and powerful as any I ve used on a desktop 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingone Need a way to organize files shared with me 
len ratingone I receive about shares a day 
len ratingone Many similar titles of files because we all work on the same program 
len ratingone Would like a directory structure that I can create and file my links into for easy retrieval 
len ratingone Along with filing it would be excellent to be able to write a comment with it 
len ratingone It could initially say shared by John Doe 
len ratingone But I could edit to add and presented at Quarterly Business Review on June 
len ratingone Current search methods are nearly useless for my purposes 
len ratingfive Next update we should be able to play mp while scrolling through files
len ratingfive Now I have a perfect place to save all my school paperwork lesson plans teaching and dance videos 
len ratingfive All in one place and also so easy to share 
len ratingfive  Thank you Amazing and encouraging stories for the day or May for life Amazing and encouraging stories for the day or May for life Amazing Amazing and encouraging stories for the day or May for lifethis and encouraging stories for the day or May for life These
len ratingfour As an infrequent user of the Google Drive utility I have to experiment each time I try to upload 
len ratingfour Some things are not intuitively obvious e g is my upload going to a web space I have used before even when the proper folder doesn t appear 
len ratingthree The UI is just clumsy 
len ratingthree would be nice to have more of a dropbox like files and folders like approach amp views showing the same 
len ratingthree There is magical interaction of the app with google photos but then when u edit delete share an item deep linked from g photos a cascade of redirections eat you up 
len ratingone App has been frozen for days 
len ratingone Won t update any of my docs even though the website shows these edits on a laptop 
len ratingone However it s literally EMPTYING my phone 
len ratingone I had to uninstall as it was uploading ALL my pics and docs to drive without any permissions or requests 
len ratingone Will be deleting my google account altogether due to this 
len ratingone This is a massive invasion of privacy and I have notified the authorities 
len ratingfive Works well across devices pc phone tablet and platforms windows iOS Android 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive Hi Rhianna 
len ratingfive Please give me a call 
len ratingfive I m in Williamsport 
len ratingfive Jim Mothersbaugh
len ratingfive Easy to use and all my items are always there when I need them
len ratingfive This app has made online school so much fun and easy for my during quarantine 
len ratingfive I couldn t do anything without this amazing app 
len ratingfive I get reminders every time I have an assignment so I won t forget to do it 
len ratingfive I love this app so much 
len ratingtwo Every time I go on the app it won t stop crashing 
len ratingtwo I ve restarted my phone deleted and reinstalled the app but it still doesn t work 
len ratingtwo Is there a way that it can be fixed 
len ratingtwo Thank you
len ratingfive I absolutely love google drive and I have several accounts so I share with all of them and so I have access to all my files regardless of the account I m connected to 
len ratingthree This needs proper iPad support 
len ratingthree You cannot drag and drop files into it 
len ratingthree Does not support right clicking with Magic Trackpad 
len ratingfive Great storage
len ratingfour Can I get a folder 
len ratingfour Cheese 
len ratingfive The Google Drive app has made my ability to work on the go more productive 
len ratingone Unable to switch accounts to work other slides for work 
len ratingone Unable to even delete old files keeps bringing them back up Require a nick name which won t let me send review 
len ratingone Can t share files easily to some apps indeed com for instance 
len ratingfive Absolutely beautiful 
len ratingfive i love this app 
len ratingfour Uploads need to process in background when app isn t open 
len ratingfour Other than that stars 
len ratingfive I ve used the drive for years 
len ratingfive Always works good 
len ratingfive And that s not a shout out to Uber
len ratingfive Nice way to send video that is too long to send by phone
len ratingfive Google Drive is easy to use even for me and does everything I need it to do
len ratingfive Very easy to use however to edit documents you must download separate appS
len ratingthree I am not sure what I m doing wrong or what I m missing but compared with OneDrive I still find Google drive confusing 
len ratingthree Where are my files 
len ratingthree Which ones are mine and which ones are others 
len ratingthree Why is it so hard to out things into folders 
len ratingone  Takes ages to upload and I can t even save videos to my camera roll
len ratingfive This is one of the must have tools out there for almost everyone in my opinion 
len ratingfive The ability to quickly upload download save documents and photos as well as view offline among countless other capabilities is a near essential for many and is most certainly helpful for almost anyone 
len ratingfive I ve used Drive across several devices between Android and iOS platforms for just shy of a decade it seems 
len ratingfive While there are bugs at times the current setup seems to run flawlessly 
len ratingone why
len ratingone  bad
len ratingfive All of my files are organized and easily assessable and I am not computer savvy 
len ratingfive Thank you Google for being so user friendly 
len ratingone will not let me do anything 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I can quickly save and send files right from my phone for work 
len ratingthree I love this game though I don t like Corona 
len ratingfour It s great for the most part but it can get kind tricky to find exactly what you re looking for 
len ratingfive Very thankful for drive and collaborations
len ratingfive Excelente servicio
len ratingone I just want a simple set of iPhone photos to be moved to and then be able to view on my Microsoft platform 
len ratingone I uploaded from phone then creating a link to them you have to do individually 
len ratingone Oddly clunky unless it s user error 
len ratingone And an hour later I m still dealing with it 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingone Why can t I just download a gmail attachment like I used to 
len ratingone Why do you go and change it 
len ratingone I did not ask for it to change 
len ratingone It is a nuisance and an inconvenience to have to run the gauntlet to get my file into iBooks like I always have done for the past years without a problem 
len ratingone Do not just change things 
len ratingone It is inconsiderate 
len ratingfive Thanks again for being there 
len ratingone I as a music maker send links all the time and have noticed a considerable amount of malfunctioning links if this issue wasn t there this would be a star rating
len ratingthree Pretty expansive tool and that is not entirely bad 
len ratingthree It is just not the most intuitive tool and a bit hard to understand 
len ratingtwo Hey Google 
len ratingtwo Whenever I am looking at photos saved in Google drive I don t need the title ribbon on top to tell me the title of each photo I scroll too 
len ratingtwo It s so annoying 
len ratingfive Incredible this app is best ever for cloud storage
len ratingfive Nice thoughts from so many 
len ratingfive Great virtual way to display those kind words and thoughts 
len ratingfive Really do wish we could have done it in person 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive It is easy and accessible 
len ratingfive I love how I can store all of my documents and be able to access it from computer 
len ratingfive It s so convenient to store everything in my drive 
len ratingfive I can access my docs from any device or computer and makes it easy to take work anywhere I am 
len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingfive I use this for school and it s way better than Microsoft word I love the way Google keeps the controls simple so it is easy to understand 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingtwo disapointed was it the developer or just me 
len ratingone  All the files I don t own can t be moved around folders even the ones only I own and it makes my drive unnecessarily messy 
len ratingone The shortcut feature should be optional when I want multiple locations for a file not obligatory 
len ratingone It s absolutely awful because anytime I turn in something on google classroom I can no longer change the location of it in my drive 
len ratingfive I ve used Google Drive for years on Android and IOS 
len ratingfive It s simple and easy to use

len ratingfive Did you think this was a mobile game when you downloaded it and saw this was for typing instead 
len ratingfive Aww yeah Google Drives has finished downloaded I m ready to kick butt 
len ratingfive Anyways why 
len ratingfive I m laughing right now because I didn t think anyone would have given Google Drive of all thinks out there to review a one star 
len ratingtwo Since the most recent update the app will close and stop playing the selected audio file 
len ratingtwo This needs to be fixed 
len ratingfive Union Hi I
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingtwo Dragging and dropping files into Apple s Files app creates a text doc that links to Google 
len ratingtwo Not useful in file transferring 
len ratingtwo Opening Google Drive in Safari and download from there seems to be a good solution 
len ratingtwo No reason to use the app 
len ratingtwo Great service on computer tho 
len ratingtwo Uploading image back up from Procreate also does not work directly 
len ratingtwo I have to download to Apple s Files and upload outside the app 
len ratingfive AAws
len ratingfive Nice easy and affirtable 
len ratingone  It s trash
len ratingfive  Great investment never fails when I m looking for something 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingthree  The app spammed me to rate it so here you go 
len ratingthree Not quite as functional as the android app 
len ratingone I can t delete any files 
len ratingfive  It s perfect
len ratingone App kills doesn t work background
len ratingone I couldn t download a video I don t know why 
len ratingfive Just starting google sheets
len ratingfive Interface is too pixelated on my IPhone 
len ratingfive bwap bwap
len ratingthree Google drive is good but just stopped moving and short of great 
len ratingthree Doesn t seem to be any more improvements like option for higher security or needing password to access 
len ratingthree As part of the Google suite Google docs should have there same directory structure files in Google docs are a mess
len ratingfive Google drive is a awesome powerful tool
len ratingone It s bad
len ratingone You say I am running out of space then you will not allow me to delete items that are in the Google drive You re only intent is to sell me more storage 
len ratingone Very deceitful 
len ratingone Maybe it s just me 
len ratingone I failed one of my midterms because drive took hours processing upload for pictures
len ratingone Totally useless on iOS
len ratingone We literally need other apps for this one to work
len ratingfive Google Drive
len ratingfive Google drive is the best 
len ratingfive Love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I can store and keep my important items all in one place and accessible by all my devices 
len ratingtwo It would be nice if I could download videos to my phone after not being able to for as long as I can remember 
len ratingtwo Im not sure if this is an Google drive on IPhone problem only but a solution would be nice 
len ratingtwo I ve literally researched for any clues on how to fix this myself and apparently this issue has persisted for years coming from the forums 
len ratingfive Hey if any one of you are looking at this I am asking for you to give a star rate 
len ratingfour Would be great if they offered different playback speeds like VLC
len ratingfive  I simply adore this app 
len ratingfive I plan to become an author one day so having something to type with is a must have 
len ratingfive There are absolutely now flaws 
len ratingfive I may be ten but please take this seriously

len ratingtwo  Gmail has DARK mode finally so Drive should too

len ratingfive I m happy 
len ratingfive  Easy to use
len ratingfive Thank you for everything Google Drive
len ratingfour This app is great 
len ratingfour I love the Face ID and Touch ID feature 
len ratingfour But I wish you could add that to all google productivity apps 
len ratingfour I have it enabled on my drive but I can still access it directly in google sheets slides etc 
len ratingfour So it just gets rid of the point of using the security feature on google drive 
len ratingfour Plz fix this

len ratingone Constantly bugging me for reviews star

len ratingtwo Copies links in Gmail instead of files so it is kind of difficult 
len ratingtwo I don t know why it s not playing my video 
len ratingfive This is an excellent way to share files and move files between devices 
len ratingfive  Please make a choice of downloading google drive content in files of iPhone or share it to apps like telegram and so 
len ratingone The most PATHETIC file sharing app I ve ever encountered 
len ratingone When I use Google Drive on desktop it s great 
len ratingone But on my iPad I can t save ANYTHING to my iPad from Google Drive 
len ratingone Nothing works 
len ratingone And yes I have sufficient space on my device to save the files I m trying to 
len ratingone I m suspecting that Apple is doing this on purpose to make Google Drive incompatible with Apple s hardware but I can t base my review on any of that since it s just suspicion 
len ratingone The only thing I can base my review on is how COMPLETELY non functional and pathetic this app is 
len ratingone Use another file sharing service 
len ratingone Google Drive won t work on this PATHETIC iPad 
len ratingfive I rely on Google Drive as assurance that data and files I might require are safely kept in the cloud 
len ratingfive My Nexus tablet became non functional so I bought an iPad th generation and Google Drive is accessible 
len ratingfive I recently added an iPhone along with my android Blackberry KEYOne and Google Drive works well on both mobile smart phones 
len ratingone your app could not possibly be worse you should die slow 
len ratingone google has always been an embarrassment to the human race and this app is no exception stop deleting my stuff stop moving my stuff 
len ratingone you might want to stop spying on us while you re at it too 
len ratingone  google has always been an embarrassment to the human race and this app is no exception stop deleting my stuff stop moving my stuff 
len ratingone you might want to stop spying on us while you re at it too 
len ratingone On my iPad the newest update keeps crashing Drive 
len ratingone It s too bad because I like the app and need to review literally thousands of files but unfortunately about files in it just goes blank and back to the main iPad screen 
len ratingone I understand the app gets updated regularly so you may wanna check this issue out 
len ratingone Btw I ve already uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingfive It s really useful Apps I lv google
len ratingfive I use google drive everyday for my personal and business purposes 
len ratingfive It has made my life way way easier 
len ratingfive Everything is at one place well organized for very very low price 
len ratingfive  stars 
len ratingone  No easy way to down load to my iPhone or iPad
len ratingfive  Great app MUST HAVE 
len ratingfive You made a beautiful rendition of my cliff note book
len ratingone You can t get your pictures from here to put in Facebook and I don t like that it sends a link instead of the actual photo
len ratingfive It works very well and helps me upload things onto my computer 
len ratingfive such a handy app 
len ratingfive I
len ratingfive i only have it for school but it works well
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive Google Drive is easy to use 
len ratingfive I have enjoyed using this app for various personal and professional projects 
len ratingfive It is simple browsing through the many documents and there s plenty of space 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive I just used it to share with my dad PDF that I compiled myself 
len ratingfive A lovely message about how Walter Shaub on Twitter wants me to know he s a vacuous crybaby or works for the KGB 
len ratingfive Or both 
len ratingfive Love this app because all my pictures and videos are protected in the cloud and available when I lost my iphone and again when my iphone xs broke down 
len ratingfive H in jV junk unh rr TCT c bbu hubby in I
len ratingfive Highly accessible usable effective for my needs My major support resources are at my fingertips
len ratingfive From what I have used it for it s good for sharing documents powerpoints transferring PDFs and much more 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Great application
len ratingtwo BAD I HATE IT
len ratingthree The Drive on Google is good 
len ratingthree It does need to do easier connections with photos by allowing categories to separate closer by topic 
len ratingthree l still can t understand how some photos get on top of it 
len ratingthree Albums on Google Photos are easier to control 
len ratingfive Love
len ratingfour My acquaintance sent me some beats to write songs to 
len ratingfour I got his beat pack 
len ratingfour At least beats but i want to hop in the shower to listen to them and have to keep tapping my iphone with wet hands 
len ratingfour Maybe there is an autoplay option I haven t discovered yet 
len ratingfour Maybe there isn t 
len ratingfour But if there isn t there needs to be one for us ENTP content creators who like to get inspiration in the shower 
len ratingone Slow
len ratingfive I really loved the thoughtfulness
len ratingfive I like Mark Weatherly as my broker at Edward Jones he has made it well worth it to myself and my wife even through the virus good advice to help my portfolio years of age and just looking for the plus for my retirement and a few home improvements
len ratingtwo App randomly closes often
len ratingfive Being able to store form and documents in an accessible place makes life easy it is a very helpful tool to keep communication flowing
len ratingfive I always use this for my math and other things and this app is the best app thanks for making this app 
len ratingfour Only one question 
len ratingfour Why I cannot switch the app to dark mode 
len ratingfive I love google drive
len ratingfive El nuevo cambio realizado para compartir archivos es muy confuso
len ratingthree Idk what it is but when scrolling through image files the app always closes suddenly after I swipe through about images Is it cause i m on an older ipad or it s not android or iOS doesn t want to play nice idk already tried restarts and reinstalls
len ratingone  Happens after seconds 
len ratingone The application is crashing every few minutes 
len ratingone No tech support at this time is available 
len ratingone Please advise
len ratingone I have a recording in my drive and it appears to be glitching because after a min or more it s stops while I m listening it s frustrating 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Muy til
len ratingone Out of nowhere this app began demanding that my device have a passcode before it would let me access my files 
len ratingone I use my iPad exclusively at home and a passcode is a huge irritation 
len ratingone I double checked with all three of my domains and none have the passcode requirement turned on in mobile device management 
len ratingone Then I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it 
len ratingone When I launched it said once again your org requires you to set a passcode Except this time I wasn t signed into any accounts anywhere on my device 
len ratingone So it s clearly not my org 
len ratingone It s a problem within the app itself 
len ratingone Security is important but I don t need an app lecturing me about it 
len ratingone Let me acknowledge the notification turn it off and access my files 
len ratingone Otherwise I ll need to switch to another form of storage and domain management 
len ratingone App crashing consistently when phone locks after approximately minute and seconds 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingtwo Keeps crashing when I play music from one of my drive files and I go to a different app or my phone locks Doesn t crash when I play music file and stay on app
len ratingthree Whenever I play music files or audio files in general the app crashes if it s in the background or the screen is locked 
len ratingthree I really hope this gets fixed
len ratingfour Not the best
len ratingthree Every time I m listening to music from my files it juss automatically stop and the app close
len ratingone App was good till it crashes every time I listen to music for second while in another app 
len ratingone Can you guys make this app not do this every time I open it please 
len ratingfive  We need dark mode support for this app 
len ratingone After the very recent updates the app keeps crashing while I play mp files which is very disappointing 
len ratingone Playing mp files on the google drive app is essential part of my work and I need it fixed 
len ratingone please check this problem and fix the issue as soon as possible 
len ratingone Happens mid music
len ratingone The most recent update causes my app to crash when my phone locks 
len ratingone Never had an issue with this before hoping it gets patched soon 
len ratingfive In a droid phone I can connect my phone and transfer video audio data of any class but with the garbage iPhones its not possible unless you use this amazing app
len ratingtwo It always crashes when I play my files
len ratingtwo Title explains it all 
len ratingtwo Other than that great app
len ratingfour The last update has files cutting off once the screen goes black 
len ratingfour Also it would be nice to be able play audio files consecutively without having to click play on each file 
len ratingthree This used to be my second most used app behind Apple Music but today on June st every audio file I ve played crashes the app every 
len ratingthree Single 
len ratingthree Time 
len ratingthree Many of these files I have played repeatedly before so I really don t see why this is happening 
len ratingthree Until you guys fix this I m uninstalling 
len ratingfive Wow
len ratingfive Hey Google team thanks for the chrome stuff 
len ratingfive It s like the future 
len ratingfive And I remember that in the future I had everyone knowing how much I loved this one guy I found him 
len ratingfive I love him 
len ratingfive Just as much as I thought I did and you will too 
len ratingfive Thanks gabby
len ratingone I am having the same issue as the most recent reviews app is crashing if I close the screen or go to another app 
len ratingone Unable to listen to a file or resume where I left off 
len ratingone Please fix this issue I use this app all day every day 
len ratingone My audio files only play for minutes and then stop
len ratingone It keeps turning off by its self 
len ratingone I use google drive exclusively to play the music that I produce 
len ratingone If my phone is locked the app will crash halfway through any audio file that s being played 
len ratingone This is unacceptable 
len ratingone Up until this point I have had no issues with google drive in any way 
len ratingone If this issue persists I will find a different source to upload and stream my music 
len ratingfive I could play sonic e x e here 
len ratingfour I love the app it s just hard to understand If it was a little easier I would give it five stars 
len ratingfour You should get it but you might be a little confused 
len ratingfour And that is the end of my review 
len ratingfour Bbbbbbbyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeee 
len ratingfive It is really good
len ratingfive Easily Using it daily 
len ratingfive It helps me learn a bunch of stuff from teachers

len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingfive How do I update information on my business card 
len ratingfive It is sooo helpful to have some files on google drive so I can get to them from all my devices 
len ratingfive Works with all different format of files
len ratingfour Why is the delete button all the way at the buttom and why cant you save multiple photos to your device annoying lil things but besides that the apps i great
len ratingtwo I have the app but it keeps crashing the heck dude
len ratingone I like it but it s pretty dumb I can t receive emails anymore because I reached my storage plan and it says I can t update it unless I contact support but there s no support 
len ratingone Please stop this
len ratingone Why is there no delete tab to delete stuff 
len ratingfive Thank you for improving the ability to delete files on google drive 
len ratingfive Good job 
len ratingfive Google is becoming one of the safest ways to chat and communicate with people 
len ratingthree I just like rating randomly

len ratingone Dear google drive You killed my father and I will forgive you I hate you and your app Love ya 
len ratingone I am a big fan of google products but this time I fee that the company is using unethical means for improving tiktok ratings 
len ratingone They are sidelining user sentiments and decided to delete the reviews to improve the rating 
len ratingone It breaks my heart seeing google dropping down to this level 
len ratingone I will try to use google less and less 
len ratingone Even my friends who work at google are ashamed of this decision 
len ratingthree Google drive keeps crashing after about seconds of playing a file

len ratingthree  I installed google about weeks ago then a few days ago I ve suddenly got a log file

len ratingone no
len ratingone I have to practically plan a day to use drive because of the uploading speed
len ratingone Please
len ratingone One reason docs
len ratingone  Gggfscsfhfhghdjh
len ratingone  Worst app I ever used
len ratingfive Loved it the most useful app I have
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive for my personal files but now that we are distance learning teaching I am using it a LOT MORE 
len ratingone  delete this app
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingone It it awesome
len ratingfive Great for school work especially during distance learning 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive because you can do stuff in all drive apps like docks slides drawings all without the actual app for it 
len ratingthree It is taking too much storage on my iPad 
len ratingthree GB and it is very unnecessary 
len ratingfour As a service it is great but I noticed the iOS app itself would run in the background for no reason 
len ratingfour Not sure why when I have no backup set 
len ratingfour I even have Background App Refresh turned off system wide 
len ratingfour EDIT It seems like linking Drive to the native Files app was what was causing it to run in the background 
len ratingfour After unlinking it does not seem to do it anymore 
len ratingfive I am very happy that I can go back to see my beautiful son
len ratingtwo  As a service it is great but I noticed the iOS app itself would run in the background for no reason 
len ratingtwo Not sure why when I have no backup set 
len ratingtwo I even have Background App Refresh turned off system wide 
len ratingone Google drive is a rip off 
len ratingone Documents don t delete and they come back repeatedly so you have to buy more space 
len ratingone Not even their own tech support can figure it out 
len ratingone It s straight garbage 
len ratingfive It is very cool and useful
len ratingone Been having trouble downloading videos to my device 
len ratingone When I hit send a copy it doesn t send a copy to my photos 
len ratingone In other words make an update make it simple to download longer videos 
len ratingone Love for y all to fix this problem
len ratingfour I like google drive except t their logo which is not very attractive they should use red in the logo
len ratingthree Google Drive s one almost insurmountable flaw is in finding documents 
len ratingthree If you know the tiles EXACTLY you may find it 
len ratingthree If you are missing one word it can be impossible 
len ratingthree Finding documents should be easy 
len ratingthree Google should use an approximate search so that every doc that has the word you use comes up 
len ratingthree JHL
len ratingthree I was using Backup and Sync so I had an online copy of my files but it deleted the files from the drive and didn t upload them to the cloud 
len ratingthree This could be because I plugged in the drive after power on but this still shouldn t have happened 
len ratingthree Except for that Google Drive is a good cloud storage service 
len ratingfive Keeps me organized and ready for whatever life brings me 
len ratingfour Overall a great app to manage files but could really use dark mode 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive This is an absolute must for my work and I love having it as an AP 
len ratingfive Just absolutely amazing 
len ratingfive Defies gravity 
len ratingfive Lol
len ratingone When I scroll too fast on a page pdf it crashes and kicks me out of the app 
len ratingone I have an iPhone with iOS 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It s very easy to use since I can just very easily transport files from my phone to my computer in seconds 
len ratingfive Payment Accessibility to change my payment options 
len ratingthree It drives me crazy that I cannot upload folders 
len ratingthree It is exhausting to upload and organize hundreds of files on my ipad ONE BY ONE 
len ratingfive I have used the Google drive for as long as I can remember as a key element in keeping track of things and retrieving docs on the go 
len ratingfive Got too many passwords 
len ratingfive Forgot your bank routing 
len ratingfive Need to edit something here and present it there 
len ratingfive Google Drive it 
len ratingfive I use a password protected Excel file to help me remember the important stuff 
len ratingfive All I need is a cell signal and I am good 
len ratingone I receive a Google doc or pdf and open it on my Mac 
len ratingone I can read it 
len ratingone When I close it the file appears to be there but it is now empty 
len ratingone Now I have to ask the sender to resend the document and must be careful to open the pdf in Mac Preview or its gone again 
len ratingone Google docs take extra steps to print 
len ratingone Very bush league 
len ratingone And where are the highlighting tools 
len ratingone Keep looking 
len ratingone Google Classroom is a total waste of time 
len ratingone By the time I can find a student s paper I ve lost minutes 
len ratingone Bottom Line use real software such as Microsquash Orifice for hundreds of dollars or Mac Pages Keynote and Numbers for a one time cost of 
len ratingone Google is in the business of tracking you to sell your profile data 
len ratingone The software seemed to be non intuitive and does not play well with Mac 
len ratingone Save your time get real software that works 
len ratingone Plus 
len ratingfive I want to tops it for unspeakable
len ratingone Watch it because Google now will erase your Google Drive if it has information Google doesn t like 
len ratingone Especially if it doesn t line up with what Google wants you to think about COVID 
len ratingfive THE BEST STARS APP
len ratingfive Love accessing everything from my different devices
len ratingthree I love Google drive but it s needs more 
len ratingthree It s hard to find things so I want it to be sorted out 
len ratingthree I want to be able to cut and past things I send to this divice from computers 
len ratingthree  Georgia Schwartz
len ratingfive Google Drive is best cloud storage service i ever had 
len ratingfive Integration with other apps is perfect way for me to manage my works 
len ratingone Not user friendly
len ratingone  So take my downvote for supporting the Communist regime 
len ratingfive Cool tool
len ratingone This app is the worst if i could give it stars i would 
len ratingone This app keeps glitching and saying i haven t don t my work when i clearly did 
len ratingone so in my ways this is a bad app

len ratingfive  This is a great app
len ratingfive It s a little early but so far like the app 
len ratingfive Convenient
len ratingone Not able to use Gb space on google drive even after completing the upgradation payment Got stuck with Gb space and unable to back up my local files 
len ratingone  I was very happy with the app until some update along the way made a fundamental change 
len ratingone Originally it acted like file storage 
len ratingone Save files and retrieve them 
len ratingone Great 
len ratingone But for some reason the iOS version now handles images differently than other files 
len ratingone It now compresses the images further and lowers the resolution 
len ratingone Try it yourself 
len ratingone Take a photo of something with detail 
len ratingone Upload to drive 
len ratingone Now compare the original with the image on drive 
len ratingone Zoom in and compare the detail 
len ratingone MUCH lower quality on G drive 
len ratingone I wonder when they changed this behavior 
len ratingone I had done this comparison a while back and the quality and resolution were preserved just fine 
len ratingone I m not talking about the lossless format 
len ratingone Just plain jpeg photos that everyone uses 
len ratingfive I cannot tell you how many times this has saved my life this year because we use this in our school and being able to do my work off of my phone is just absolutely fantastic 
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingone When I leave a file it takes me to my recents instead of the folder I was just inspecting 
len ratingone Also the tab bar disappears 
len ratingone Basically unusable to view multiple docs in a folder 
len ratingfive Can be slow to update but is very helpful
len ratingfive I love the way I can use all the google products in one place 
len ratingfive I love google creator of all google apps I love you I will discribe 
len ratingfour Things aren t loading fast enough and it s causing me problems with my new remote learning and it takes too much space and energy and to make it worse my iPad is full 
len ratingfive Me ayuda mucho para mis trabajos en la escuela
len ratingtwo Heyyy tell Yu later 
len ratingtwo I had my school account here 
len ratingtwo Okie tell you later
len ratingfive Easy to manage 
len ratingfive Quick access on or offline 
len ratingfive With my smart phone I can scan a document then upload it to my drive and quickly save it to any file I want 
len ratingone Impossibly difficult getting video of it
len ratingfive Good app mate I luv dis
len ratingone You can t edit any documents unless you get the docs app so there is no point in installing this app just gets the docs one 
len ratingone I m not sure why you made this but then you need other apps to be able to edit anything 
len ratingone Same with slides you can t edit unless you get the slides app so just avoid this app and get the ones you need 
len ratingone It s stupid how pointless this app is 
len ratingfive We messed around with one drive for years and couldn t get past it s quirks errors and difficulty 
len ratingfive We switched to google drive a year ago and poof all the issues went away 
len ratingfive We use drive stream and it works like a charm
len ratingtwo I kind of like it
len ratingfive During the corona time we have to do e learning and this helps a lot 
len ratingfive I use it every day the videos that I watch doesn t glitch the screen is not blurry at all 
len ratingfive I love it

len ratingfour I love this app but it is hard to work with on iPad or phone

len ratingfour I recommend this to anyone who wants to create slides or anything and sharing with anyone 
len ratingfour This app is awesome 
len ratingfive I love to cook and bake with my boyfriend 
len ratingfive My music is on for my choir 
len ratingfive Google Drive is really good with any apple device 
len ratingfive Whether it a computer or a Apple phone or even an I pad it perfect 
len ratingtwo When I was doing homework I finished so I clicked save and exited and it didn t save this is terrible
len ratingone Came from Dropbox 
len ratingone Compared to Dropbox this is garbage 
len ratingone App doesn t always load 
len ratingone No doc scanning 
len ratingone No no and no
len ratingfive Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
len ratingfour I use apple products for everything except my PC 
len ratingfour One feature I wish google drive s iPhone app supported was direct document scanning to PDF 
len ratingfour It s a hassle to use another means Notes app to scan papers to PDFs 
len ratingfour I ve had to resort to using OneDrive eww as my primary virtual storage and it s only because I can t scan PDFs with my iPhone to google drive 
len ratingfive I like this app BUT you can t make changes to your docs so that is bad 
len ratingfive  A PERSON

len ratingfour Great product 
len ratingfour Sharing should be easier
len ratingfive Amazing to be able to look back on memories that I d forgotten
len ratingfive My online school work has grown so organized and easier I LOVE It 
len ratingone drive each pic taking several minutes each painfully slow 
len ratingone Normally I don t rate apps but the app asked me to rate it when I was especially frustrated so I tried by selecting only one star 
len ratingone Then the app would not let me submit my rating with only one star selected 
len ratingone That was so slimy and unfair 
len ratingone So I made the arduous journey all the way to the App Store to rate the product 
len ratingone Very sneaky to invite people to rate in app and then only allow the good ratings to get through 
len ratingone I just lost respect for this company 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I get my work done 
len ratingfive It s efficient
len ratingfive I think that Drive is very helpful when you want to make posters or just have fun and type a story 
len ratingfive Also it s very helpful that you can insert photo so that if you want to show a picture of something you can 
len ratingfive Very quick and easy access
len ratingfive Google Drive is great 
len ratingfive It helps you store your files 
len ratingtwo Does not upload my pictures amp videos I would have to try on many different occasions to get it to load
len ratingfour Search engine needs big work is it just me or is it you love the app though 
len ratingfour Wish I could add a picture
len ratingthree I can t find it easy to handle Not user friendly as much as other clouds
len ratingfive Excelente
len ratingone Frequently crashes and no easy way to select multiple files
len ratingfive  Although I do have some problems with the end user agreement EUA since Google seems to imply that you don t own what you put in your drive I doubt that Google would jeopardize their business model by curtailing access to documents that I have in the drive 
len ratingfive Very functional very efficient and the user interface is intuitive 
len ratingfive This app is so ruse full that I can use it on everything
len ratingone Sro asking me to review
len ratingone Drive confuses me because it is hard to get what I want 
len ratingone I have lost files and documents because google drive deletes the 
len ratingfive Super good just a few minor glitches
len ratingfour  This app is great but I wish it would display all of my files when I open it 
len ratingfour Instead I have to search for them 
len ratingfive This hold everything I want
len ratingtwo If this one bug gets fixed I can give this app a much higher review 
len ratingtwo Google drive has been good to me for a long time 
len ratingtwo But recently I can t download video files from google drive to my iPhone 
len ratingtwo I use this for business so this is a real problem 
len ratingtwo I click on the App Support and it takes me to a broken link 
len ratingtwo No support there 
len ratingtwo Search online for help all I find are other people having the same issue 
len ratingtwo Otherwise a pretty great storage and sharing app 
len ratingfive  Love the
len ratingfour  without Google Drive 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfour  Why I am rating this app stars is because it makes me get almost all of the google apps that my iPad has no more memory 
len ratingfour Please let me use all of the features of all of the apps in just one app 
len ratingfour P S 
len ratingfour Sometimes when I upload one of the files to Google drive is 
len ratingfour THEY DON T GET THERE 
len ratingfour And so That takes up my computer s memory AND I have to keep making copies of it until I have the amount I want please make it do all of this stuff and make it have you enter your password when you open one of your files for extra security 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone I sent all the pics hoping it will save it 
len ratingone I never knew I have to pay for more room

len ratingtwo I got to get away from rive and this extortion
len ratingfive The video player could use an interface update 
len ratingfive and then I have my mom to pick her up I don t have to work tomorrow 
len ratingone Not user friendly
len ratingfive But for grown ups
len ratingfive Me parece excelente google drive tiene much simas opciones y es sencillo de utilizar para guardar archivos y dem s cosas 
len ratingfive Lo nico que lamento es que no se pueda pasar fotos de google drive a las fotos en un iPhone pero me imagino que esto es por el software de apple cosa rara 
len ratingfive  Stars say no more
len ratingfive This app is OUTSTANDING 
len ratingfive It is very helpful 
len ratingfive Download this NOW if you are reading this 
len ratingthree Why are my documents appearing offline 
len ratingthree I can t find the reason for this 
len ratingone Just tried accessing a mp 
len ratingone Gave up after a while 
len ratingone Got nothing 
len ratingfive Uploads faster then Dropbox
len ratingfive Google Drive is a perfect place to store information or important presentations that you need 
len ratingfive You can easily store stuff here with just logging in with a google account 
len ratingfive That is why I like Google Drive 
len ratingfive  Maya
len ratingfive Town
len ratingthree Google drive can upload send and take pictures but what it can t do is let me write on my schoolwork I have to download google drive for that and I don t want to so I am mad 
len ratingfive There s really nothing to be upset about when using this app 
len ratingfive It is extremely good and I use it all the time when I need to transfer photos to my chrome book for school 
len ratingfive This app is really helping me keep up with my classes and help keep everything organized 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Lo

len ratingfive I can easily use my google drive on my phone tablet or computer to access anything I need for work or home at anytime 
len ratingfive There are many times I have used the drive in my phone to help my students with long distance learning 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive Los documentos insertados est n a muy buen resguardo
len ratingone Keeps crashing on my IPad very frustrating
len ratingfour The scan option needs to be included in the app just as it s included in the Android app 
len ratingfive I enjoy drive because is helpful for documents storage 
len ratingfive It provides great hints for writing and tools for doing it well 
len ratingfour I wish the date was also labeled as Apple production of pic taken have been 
len ratingfour Also of location if the choice was available 
len ratingfour No more deleting accidentally of miniSD cards having life online 
len ratingfive Sweet memories 
len ratingfive Drive is a great way to keep all my school stuff organized 
len ratingtwo  like most google products this app is half baked and never seems to be updated to completion 
len ratingtwo the file organization system is acceptable but could be improved 
len ratingtwo the desktop backup amp sync app needs more work to make it sync to iOS iPadOS properly every time and to NOT have separate menu bar icons for each synced account 
len ratingtwo it feels like google cornered the market and now is complacent in building the drive based google suite up to higher functionality 
len ratingtwo or alternatively that engineers are being told to do design work never a good idea 
len ratingtwo iOS has been out for a while so you re behind on integrating dark mode 
len ratingtwo it would also be nice to close full screen images in drive by swiping down rather than tapping the X at the top that might just be on iPadOS 
len ratingtwo be better google 
len ratingtwo stop trying to outdo facebook at corporate evil 
len ratingtwo you used to have a motto about that 
len ratingone This app is stupid
len ratingfive hi gogole i m happy you made this app
len ratingfive Greatest File Storage App since Virtual Sliced Bread

len ratingfour Since it s not a feature i have to screenshot images from my drive and the quality of the screenshot isn t as good as the original photo s quality

len ratingfive Like the usability of the drive 
len ratingfive Nice clean app

len ratingtwo  coincidence apple cloud charges exactly same as you do 
len ratingtwo Yet I believe I use Apple Yet Read I used Goggle Drive and Storage Please some one tell me If I used Where would I know to look at history as I never took photos back or videos or data 
len ratingtwo IF THIS IS WHY SO MANY PHOTOS ARE LIVE TYPE THAT ALL ALLONG WEREN T

len ratingtwo Id love my missing data 
len ratingtwo somebody do something please
len ratingone Can t sign document

len ratingthree Lots of quirks 
len ratingthree Ok I m fairly inexperienced with this and am trying to save off big files from various sources and devices 
len ratingthree Is it me or are there just a lot of tips and tricks you need to know as you save move and rename 
len ratingthree Especially from Apple devices

len ratingfour I use Drive for document storage mostly 
len ratingfour I don t work up documents much so don t know how it s production tools rate

len ratingfive I use it like my online desktop 
len ratingfive It is pretty convenient 
len ratingfour Good drive on the go
len ratingfive  It s cool
len ratingfour I think that I like it because it had some things in it that I would use 
len ratingfive Convenient intuitive amp has good integration with Microsoft Office software 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingthree It ok but deleting pictures seems to be an issue 
len ratingthree I wish there was a delete button by the picture 
len ratingfive Now I can upload anything from my friends and family plus projects 
len ratingfive Thank you Google Drive 
len ratingfive I have been using Drive for almost a year and it is really helpful 
len ratingfive It keeps all of my work organized in docs in folders 
len ratingfive So it s not just all over the place and jumbled up 
len ratingfive I am years old 
len ratingfive In my school we start using Drive in rd grade 
len ratingfive I think I know why because Google Drive is SUPER ORGANIZED and helpful 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingone  SHOW ME UR FEET
len ratingone  I can t find a way to remove files 
len ratingone When I go to Help it has a very clear description of how to delete files documents WHICH IS WRONG 
len ratingfive With all his working from home drive is super helpful 
len ratingfive  I like this app and that s all I have to say 
len ratingthree I am a student who has this its good to look back but not very useful
len ratingfive All my documents are easy to access and file 
len ratingfive It has everything I need for college 
len ratingfive I use it to store all of my artwork and it looks as vivid as when I created it in my pad 
len ratingfive I m not sure how I would make it through this world pandemic without my best friend Google 
len ratingfour hello thx for the app pls make dark theme option 
len ratingfive Fast 
len ratingfive Convenient 
len ratingfive  Excellent way to save any file
len ratingfive This is a very useful service thank you
len ratingtwo It s a crapshoot if you can get files out of drive and into your app 
len ratingtwo Can t batch save images to your iPad 
len ratingtwo Can t export to dropbox etc 
len ratingtwo Does not play well with iOS 
len ratingfive Thank you Miss Watkins very nice
len ratingfive Lifesaver and what I always use for everything
len ratingfive This is the most amazing tool I ve ever used 
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingfive Available and reliable 
len ratingfive No need to to tote around a laptop 
len ratingone When I first downloaded this it said We required a passcode to access your files when I had already signed in so I decided to delete the app 
len ratingtwo No privacy screen as touted in this release 
len ratingtwo It is only available on the iPad version 
len ratingtwo Not on the iPhone version 
len ratingtwo If you require privacy avoid until fixed 
len ratingfour Pretty good 
len ratingfour Just sometimes hard to use 
len ratingfive Love this program 
len ratingthree rt
len ratingfive This is a great app and the new privacy screen feature lets you protect your files and I really enjoy that 
len ratingfive The app developers have made a great app and I hope they continue to make it a great app 
len ratingfive Google drive has been a life saver 
len ratingfive In the past keeping up with essential documents meant using one device or emailing to yourself 
len ratingfive Now I have all my important documents at my fingertips 
len ratingfive This allows me to stay on track with my essential business 
len ratingfive Thanks for being so smart and sharing 
len ratingfive This app I d one of the best 
len ratingfive I recommend it to all my friends
len ratingfour  It would be helpful to have folders for forms or a search bar for them 
len ratingfour Only the most currently used appears at the top of the screen making it difficult to locate and the list view can t be sorted by type 
len ratingfive Excellent no complains
len ratingfour I ve been trying to set my laptop background a certain picture and everytime I go to use the file it s not there but when I go into it it s there
len ratingfive I got all my music in these files and it s so cool 
len ratingfive I love that I can play my music and save it 
len ratingfive Thanks google drive
len ratingfour Thank you fire adding the features to this app 
len ratingfour Please add to other apps such as Keep WiFi Photos 
len ratingfour and anything you might see worthy of extra security 
len ratingfive I like all of google products 
len ratingone I don t have to share my opinion on this app 
len ratingone But I just agree that it s bad
len ratingfive It is good
len ratingone This makes me vomit
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingtwo Hard to open link
len ratingone Just lame can t save to phone only to drive 
len ratingone Can t edit video clips 
len ratingone Just lame and I hate I have vids stuck on it
len ratingfive I m using an android phone and macbook 
len ratingfive This app is the only way to save and access files between two devices 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app to iOS Android users 
len ratingfive I have all my files no matter how many phone s break stolen I always back up my drive everything is saved even from my laptop that was stolen I still have all my documents on there it s such a great app 
len ratingone Google drive is unpredictable 
len ratingone Hard to use 
len ratingone Easy to lose files 
len ratingfive THE BEST 
len ratingone It is a horrible app 
len ratingone This is how I feel while I am on it 
len ratingone It sometimes deletes my stuff 
len ratingfour This app allows you to use photos and videos for your document or project 
len ratingfour It is better and has more options than google docs does though google docs is also a great site to create documents or projects 
len ratingfour Obviously you can share the project to others who may find it interesting 
len ratingfour I find it useful for school and homework because you can show a picture video or type out a report or essay 
len ratingfour Next just send it to your teacher and wait till they respond 
len ratingfour It can also be used fo free time if you want to right a short story 
len ratingfour You can print it out on paper as well and then you can bring it to someone and show your work to them 
len ratingfour I also suggest having grammarly which is an app 
len ratingfour It fixes incorrect spelling 
len ratingfour By the way right now it just underlined grammarly with red because it s not a word its an app 
len ratingfour If you have google docs then when you get google drive everything you made in google docs is also there 
len ratingfour You have to have an account either a school account or your own account

len ratingfive It is one of the great applications in keeping and storing documents
len ratingfive Alphabet Google is always innovating and Google Drive is one of their biggest 
len ratingfive Good interface and seamless integration along with subsidized costs makes this a necessary addition to any cell phone or device 
len ratingfive Toda mi empresa la organizo aqu 
len ratingfive Utilizo todas las herramientas 
len ratingfive Lo recomiendo 
len ratingfive Dope 
len ratingone There is no way to navigate well anywhere 
len ratingone Files randomly appear and disappear 
len ratingone A file that was posted might or might not be there when you look for it 
len ratingfive google drive is an amazing app to save files to your google account
len ratingfive Continue great job Great service
len ratingtwo  Eh 
len ratingfive  It is so easy and fun but little thing that I would change is that you can download pictures because I can t do it but 
len ratingfour It totally works 
len ratingone Please add google drawing as an app I have to do it for an assignment on my iPad and it won t work at all and I can t use a computer cause I don t have one 
len ratingthree  i have a problem with saving vids to my phone it won t go to my gallery i thought it was my storage so i deleted many apps off my phone and i re download google drive and it still won t work
len ratingfive This allows me to combine all of my essential work in different folders 
len ratingfive It has become a necessary tool for my personal and professional endeavors 
len ratingfive Google drive is so awesome and is super free download now
len ratingfour Google Drive is the best
len ratingfive This app is my first review and it s my first star 
len ratingfive This app totally diseves this it unbelievable
len ratingthree It won t let you upload and pictures to my phone I have to take the picture on the app like that defeats the whole purpose
len ratingthree  I wasn t able to open the video sent to me
len ratingfive BAd
len ratingfive It has been my first time using the app it is super convenient to save and store files 
len ratingfive Best app I would ever use 
len ratingfive It s very helpful and organized and works with all the websites I use for school 
len ratingfive I highly recommend 
len ratingone disappointed cause my ipad mini version cant install this apps
len ratingfive This app is the greatest app I could ever get 
len ratingfive I store everything in this app everything is fine 
len ratingfive I can keep it private and safe 
len ratingfive There are tons of documents in this thing and it works fine 
len ratingfive I trust this app A LOT 
len ratingfive It s really Great
len ratingfive I LOVE GOOGLE DRIVE I CAN SAVE THINGS ON THERE AND NEVER LOSE IT
len ratingfive Pooooooooooo
len ratingfour the reason i rated a is because i was trying to upload a video and took wayy too long 
len ratingfour i need to attach it to my assignment 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingone It s disorganized can t find documents that are saved can t modify documents it s just the worst 
len ratingone Honestly a terrible app from a company like google 
len ratingone The user interface while watching a video is horrible and not being given the choice to open a file in google drive instead of being forced to use another app is bad 
len ratingfive I love drive and I use it all the time for my work 
len ratingone It is hard to use
len ratingfive II Can Edit Peacefully
len ratingfive Uayyay
len ratingthree So I have used Drive for as long as I can remember and sometimes well it gets a little on my nerves 
len ratingthree I have a few things I want the producers to know and respond soon 
len ratingthree I am getting restless 
len ratingthree  It lags 
len ratingthree It lags so much it took me at least minutes to get a document 
len ratingthree I use Google Classroom which corresponds with drive and some peers of mine complain about the service of both to me 
len ratingthree I am writing this review to keep my peers happy so they can learn more 
len ratingthree With distance learning it may be hard to correspond with teachers that s why drive is important 
len ratingthree We can get school assignments from classroom The drive classroom correspondence and we are able to print out what s needed 
len ratingthree If it is lagging I can t finish assignments and sometimes they are past due 
len ratingthree This is a problem to me and I need it fixed 
len ratingthree Soon 
len ratingthree  Glitching 
len ratingthree I use Drive a lot and I have music files videos for dance numbers documents for school and so much more 
len ratingthree One time I was trying to locate a file I can t remember what and the app glitched me out 
len ratingthree I ended up all most failing It turned out to be a study guide 
len ratingthree This is your fault that I happened to get a bad grade 
len ratingthree Not only was it a bad grade my parents were disappointed in me as well 
len ratingthree This was a terrible time and I greatly need this problem fixed 
len ratingthree  Storage 
len ratingthree Like I said previously I have a lot of stuff in my drive 
len ratingthree I need storage 
len ratingthree As a child I don t have the ability to pay for extra so if I run out I am stuck 
len ratingthree You should have a feature where you put things in storage and you can get them out later 
len ratingthree I really need these updates soon 
len ratingtwo honestly this app is really nice and all but it s kind of laggy and takes a long time to load or upload 
len ratingtwo please fix this and this app still has bug issues so please fix that too 
len ratingfour I like this app 
len ratingfour It could be better because o can t edit anything 
len ratingfour The camera quality decreases when I try and take a picture directly on the app to upload on my drive and so I have to first take a pic on my phone upload the picture then go from there 
len ratingfour I don t know why the quality decreases but I hope that can be fixed 
len ratingfive This is the best app because it helps me and i can do my work
len ratingfive I use it a lot for school and it works perfectly 
len ratingfive I love the convenience of google drive 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive I am wanting to be an author when I grow up so this is great 
len ratingfive I am already writing stories on paper but this is way easier 
len ratingfive My sister has written books on it too but she said she didn t want to be an author 
len ratingfive Her books that she stared I think are actually good 
len ratingfive So thanks for this app 
len ratingfive It was awesome 
len ratingfive So so good
len ratingfive It is so good I love it so much
len ratingone This app is next to useless for IOS 
len ratingone It takes forever to download a book Jesus Christ I just want to add it to my books 
len ratingfive For online school I usually have to take a picture on my laptop with the face cam which is really hard and now on my phone I just easily snap a picture
len ratingthree Love it but 
len ratingthree I is not really organized well after that it is good plz upgrade it more but not that fancy OK 
len ratingtwo It s unbelievable that this feature is still non existent for this app 
len ratingtwo If someone shares photos with me I have to click each one separately and download them one at a time to my camera roll 
len ratingtwo If you select them all at once there is no option to send them all to my camera roll 
len ratingtwo It boggles my mind that after all this time this still hasn t been implemented 
len ratingfive Google drive is really helpful especially if you are doing online school 
len ratingfive You can find all your work here 
len ratingfive I recommend google drive to EVERYONE 
len ratingfive Google doc is awesome especially because of the time we re in from covid
len ratingone How I put my book mark please tell me
len ratingfive Google docs is cool and entertaining 
len ratingfive I usually use computer or laptop for google docs but if iPad is best for you that s fine
len ratingfive I love the app 
len ratingfive If you have to print something this is the app 
len ratingfive Google drive is super handy for any school work I do because what ever I do on it my teacher has ALL access to it at anytime at all 
len ratingfive It is also VERY helpful for book reports 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Very helpful 
len ratingfive Sharing ideas thoughts work has driven my success to new heights 
len ratingfive Love google drive 
len ratingfive I make a lot of work for my students and leave it there and print as I need 
len ratingfive It s great to have access to your work no matter where you are or on which computer 
len ratingthree I like it because it saves all your work and it connects to google drive
len ratingfive It s great to have multiple documents photos etc all in one place which makes for easy access 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingthree Coming from student it s great 
len ratingthree But it s hard to use it on a phone 
len ratingthree Needing to download stuff 
len ratingthree Or go to the web to get on 
len ratingtwo Google drive will not upload a min or a min video that my son needs to submit for school projects 
len ratingone I have to do school work
len ratingthree Anybody else have an issue with the app crashing 
len ratingthree I store photos and when I view them it crashes within minutes 
len ratingthree I ve uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingthree Signed out and in 
len ratingthree Updated my iOS 
len ratingthree No change 
len ratingfour I like google drive because you that is also one of the places to do online work 
len ratingone Confusing on an iPhone
len ratingone It keeps zooming out of my video 
len ratingone Doesn t support iMovie
len ratingfive I like to use it for class
len ratingone I don t like school so I don t like google drive 
len ratingone But it ez what it ez so yeah have a nice day 
len ratingfive Your doing awesome
len ratingone Had drive forever but for a while now it doesn t let me save my video files to my phone I have an iPhone it stopped saving when I had the which I thought it was the phone turns out it wasn t I ve reset and all of that what s a solution please 
len ratingfive It doesn t keep track of all your work in order
len ratingone  Beacause i hate school
len ratingfive First off the app works great and allows me a easily access all my files on any device wherever I am 
len ratingfive However I do which the gmail app would allow me to send files from my drive as attachments instead of google drive links
len ratingfive It s nice but I don t like how you are required to get the app just to put pictures into your drive
len ratingfive  Google Doc
len ratingfive Simply Amazing
len ratingfive Great stuff
len ratingfive Drive is convenient and great 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive No complaints here 
len ratingfive  Simply the best
len ratingfive Always Good for me
len ratingone This is incredibly slow 
len ratingone I understand that everyone is still gonna get this app because it was made by google but hear me out don t get this just don t waste your time 
len ratingfour No se puede guardar en la galer a
len ratingfive Google drive is amazing for presentations and documents 
len ratingfive I use it everyday for work 
len ratingfive I run out of chicken stock so I couldn t make any sauce I wanted to make a chicken velout I thought I had an extra box of chicken stock because I always have extra my living conditions wasn t the best so could have make my own stock 
len ratingfive However my pilaf has enough flavor so I didn t even missed not having any sauce my chicken was very flavorful juicy and well cooked 
len ratingfive I cooked what I had on hand because chicken and rice or some of the staple ingredients that I always keep on hand because I can have a meal ready in hour or less 
len ratingfive I find this dish easy to prepare so it s always my go to 
len ratingfive My situation for this meal is a little complicated I am on my externship living in employee housing and don t have the adequate utensils to make a proper meal I have my knifes that s about it but anyway you I have to eat the reason for not having pots and pans we all eat at work so I guess that wasn t important 
len ratingfive I enjoy cooking this meal for a lot of reasons one I get to work on my knife skills with cutting of the vegetables this meal is one of the first meal that I find easy to to make at school so I always run to it for my easy meal 
len ratingfive Fabricating of the chicken breast which I enjoy and seasoning and cooking and getting an excellent result every time give me the confidence that I am learning 
len ratingfive I enjoy cooking I am always learning 
len ratingfive I called this dish my quarantine rice pilaf chicken breast without any sauce that I didn t missed 
len ratingfive I enjoyed my meal and will be making it again very soon 
len ratingthree The service is powerful and versatile but the app is a sub par experience on iOS 
len ratingthree Google decided not to follow iOS s app and interface conventions so certain things like drag and drop between apps which are normally available across the system do not work 
len ratingfive This is a great app and I can make pictures I don t have to download the other apps 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Everyone will love this app the writer
len ratingfive Google drive can hold
len ratingfive Since we don t have school irl we still can use this 
len ratingone The fact you can t simply download your files and have the ourpose

len ratingfive I had downloaded this app because I was having trouble uploading pictures to my computer via google account and this is a lifesaver 
len ratingfive Now I can go into the app already signed in to my school account and see what my friends teachers have said on my assignments 
len ratingfive Great app and allows me to upload download voew individual files 
len ratingfive Unlike the desktop version that only allows backup and sync 
len ratingfive I like picking and choosing individual files rather than a whole device backup

len ratingone I m a content creator and I ve been using cloud services and large storages for years now and i need to access my vids in my phone ALOT but to be honest this app is so poorly integrated with iOS and super slow 
len ratingone I mean way smaller cloud services and almost unknown companies made their app thousands times better than this one 
len ratingone I even downloaded vlc player and logged into Drive from there because it gives me better control to my vids while having Drive app only to access files which is not my main use of the service anyway 
len ratingfive Ien
len ratingone I do not want to allow access to my camera 
len ratingone I should only be able to allow what I want to send 
len ratingone What really bothers me It s how they connect with Google photos 
len ratingone Why should one have anything to do with the other 
len ratingone Why should I lose access to my unlimited google photos storage because of google drive 
len ratingone It is the worst Why figure it out 
len ratingfive Excellent service
len ratingone Reallly bad take it down
len ratingfive Locating the files once opened is a little diffcult but everything else is pretty good 
len ratingfive Very very Nice 
len ratingfive  Free easy to use searchable
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingfive I am enjoying the opportunity to keep items in a storage to which I know I am able to retrieve

len ratingfour I was writing a journal and every once in a while the last entry is missing 
len ratingfour I Googled it to see if anyone could explain it and got nothing so now I just use Apple Notes 
len ratingfive I would be wandering aimlessly through life without google drive

len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone When I go to work on stuff in my drive it will open for a second and close I can t even get in the app 
len ratingfour I can see documents but I can t edit them 
len ratingfour I get that there are other apps for each type of thing you can create but i would find it a lot easier if they were all combined in one app

len ratingthree Es muy confuso no puedo eliminar los archivos
len ratingfour I feel like it copied google docs

len ratingfive FY gvhvffffvtftgggtvtfftrffftvtrfghvtgvgggtvgfttggyftvtff
len ratingfour  Great app but could be better

len ratingone This app is so confusing that I feel like I need a tutorial even though I am fairly tech savvy 
len ratingone I would yose goggle callroom
len ratingone  No u
len ratingfive I like this app because it shows what I get done
len ratingfive Easy to operate and it s consistent
len ratingfive Thank you Google for creating an app that allows me store my assignments in this tough time we are going through 
len ratingfive Wish it had more than GB of storage for students 
len ratingone The app crashes often on the IPad 
len ratingfive I love google drive and google slides 
len ratingfive I love the software so user friendly 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive This app is well organized clear and just amazing 
len ratingfive To tally recommend to someone who needs to be organized with assignments or just be ordered in general 
len ratingone  I can t download multiple files at once but I can on my Dropbox app for years 
len ratingone Uploading and download files is slow and tedious on both my iPad Pro and IPhone 
len ratingone I can t even open an pdf in my book app on my iPad
len ratingone Okay so I downloaded this app on my phone so I can edit docs and slides and other stuff on the go without need for other apps but guess what 
len ratingone YOU CANT EDIT STUFF WITHOUT THE OTHER APPS ON MOBILE COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS 
len ratingone One of the main reasons this app exists is to edit stuff but on mobile u can t 
len ratingone Google please fix this
len ratingone I haagbhbghbhh
len ratingthree I don t understand how to use Google Drive 
len ratingthree It s very confusing 
len ratingthree Hi I m a photographer and I back up my work to Google Drive on my desktop and then I download it for editing on my iPad but I can t see anything but a small preview of the Raw files if you open it everything you get is this text the file type is not supported 
len ratingthree And you can t see the file 
len ratingthree Please fix this problem and the size of those little previews is annoying too it should be more like the actual look of the photo 
len ratingthree Other than that the service is good 
len ratingfive Tool 
len ratingfive What s the title
len ratingthree T 
len ratingfive R e a l l y g r e a t t o u s e f o r s c h o o l w o r k 
len ratingone  It will is a horrible platform to use
len ratingfour This is really awesome tool to use for school
len ratingfive This is so wonderful for writing books or stories with somebody 
len ratingfive I use this more than Word now 
len ratingfive I highly suggest 
len ratingtwo I don t like google drive it is bad
len ratingfive All your slides are organized from most recently used to least recently used you can also search them up if you can t find them 
len ratingfive I like how easy it is to capture all my pictures and restore them on my flash drive 
len ratingfive It is great for online school
len ratingone So hard to simply select and send multiple PDFs
len ratingfour Can be slow to load and sink 
len ratingone Why this app have not been work properly 
len ratingone It is hard to add or delete extra files
len ratingfive Since the COVID pandemic I have been forced to work remotely using my IPAD amp a laptop 
len ratingfive I am NOT very computer savvy amp strongly depend on my younger team to navigate me through the day 
len ratingfive Once I discovered Google DRIVE my life became manageable 
len ratingfive When everything is SO out of control it is comforting to know you won t lose your job 
len ratingfive Thank you Google DRIVE genius department
len ratingtwo delayed in loading
len ratingfive Good for placing pictures receipts bills memories
len ratingone Keeps losing the sound
len ratingfive We have been in cyberspace education since the days of General Electrics in Connecticut chat rooms where brilliant men like Jerry Pournell would hang out chatting about race gender and class 
len ratingfive When Blackboard and websites became useful tools we were first on the bandwagon developing the user platforms and algorithms we called policy 
len ratingfive Now with the stunning array of tools for teachers we find Google leading the way in secured communications and user platform development in cyberspace 
len ratingfive Like Walmart in D World Google is hardening its security networks while building out functionality in every area of needed interface 
len ratingfive As an engineered cyberspace infrastructure builder Google is leading the way from a position of strength in that many software developers already know the Google interfaces so connectivity between vendors and Google is high 
len ratingfive The data security problems that come with silos and the lack of control over cloud data are issues most likely to be resolved at a government level for companies that plan to exploit the people but the idea that people should subscribe or pay beyond the costs of actual maintenance and R amp D like we do in the Utilities Model in D World may go with the promise of free energy 
len ratingfive Just like the roads and bridges are paid for from the common funds so we pay for use of integrated teaching and community building tools with blocks of stored data for blockchain mines and distributed processing access 
len ratingfive Like other enterprises marching into the NewNet Era Google is doing critical work that will sustain the NewNet until the next major technological age begins 
len ratingfive Their work thus far has been brilliantly conceived and well executed 
len ratingfive We can trust Google to do this right and protect our intellectual property as part of the plans 
len ratingfive Great service 
len ratingone All apps are basically a beta test 
len ratingone What kind of cloud storage app offers no scanning function 
len ratingone What a joke 
len ratingone I love the way I am able to send pictures and files to people so far 
len ratingfive Amazingly easy and versatile wish I had more free memory 
len ratingfive Google Drive is the key to providing personal accessibility and flexibility on numerous devices and between the right people when needed 
len ratingfour I updated some files on my computer but not updated after days 
len ratingfour Both devices are connected with WiFi 
len ratingthree Contact me if you want help
len ratingfive This drop box has helped us during these trying times 
len ratingfive We have been able to upload things and share with everyone 
len ratingfour Solo necesito un reproductor de musica para ejecutar mi m sica dentro de drive
len ratingfive Use it every day for professional and personal work 
len ratingfive So easy to share with family and coworkers 
len ratingfive Collaboration is fast and easy
len ratingtwo Trying to learn the benefit of having app for Drive when you just have to download all the other apps in order to use it 
len ratingtwo Huh 
len ratingtwo  save some space and just get sheets or docs drive has no real use
len ratingtwo I have a wma audio file on my Google Drive 
len ratingtwo When I access it from this app on my iPhone it says Problem with file and it won t play 
len ratingone This is probably very easy to navigate for the engineers that designed it 
len ratingone But for us non technical people it s a nightmare 
len ratingone Crashes after viewing ten photos and totally botches the quality of photos 
len ratingfive This is the first app for cloud storage 
len ratingfive  an encouraging and uplifting video message from a shepherd to his flock 
len ratingfive Thank you for a moment of personal counseling and familiarity 
len ratingfive Just a great place to keep files and all that
len ratingone  Idk I don t want school
len ratingfive Great product keep important documents and memories
len ratingfive Love having access to all my information 
len ratingfour Like it
len ratingfive It s been a blast using it
len ratingone Takes too long to save videos 
len ratingtwo I get a message that I am out of space try to sell me an upgrade but no help in freeing up space 
len ratingfive I like this app a lot but I ve got a lot to learn about it 
len ratingfive Thank you for saving my pictures on your drive 
len ratingfive It s exciting to see some of the old pics also when it appears as a memory and when albums are made 
len ratingfour All in the title tbh
len ratingfive Compelling story line Great sound effects Dramatic musical underscores Voice acting that draws you in
len ratingfive Just absolutely amazing it s not like google needs May more reviews 
len ratingfive I love google drive i have all of my files here 
len ratingfive One feature that would be great is for example when you share a link or send a someone a file through email to have an expiration like i send the file or link to someone and I only want that person to have access to that file for a few days 
len ratingfive That would be a great feature because when i share something things i always forget to turn of link or sharing or remove their emails from having any access Overall i love the app
len ratingfive It good use it
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingone I have iPhone and when google changed the way google drive and google pictures were together the picture view in the folders of google drive are to small to see 
len ratingone I have to open each one to find the one I am looking for 
len ratingone The view in Android phones are still large enough to see 
len ratingfive Very good app great for backing up my pictures 
len ratingfive Hate Exchange compared to Google solutions 
len ratingfive As a teacher all my files accessible everywhere and seamlessly integrated 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive It s amazing 
len ratingfive I just wish there was a step by step tutorial on organizing the files right at the beginning when you start using it but I seriously love this because it rarely crashes on you 
len ratingfour I like it it is fine I don t care about it that much
len ratingfive This is a review for review purposes
len ratingfive You make my job easier at a time when I need all the help I can get
len ratingone  No
len ratingone  Please add a widgets for recent files and a widget for uploading or scanning files etc 
len ratingone Add dark mode support 
len ratingfive The best
len ratingone  I hate google 
len ratingone It is very slow and non responsive 
len ratingone Cost me a good grade 
len ratingone I hate you 
len ratingfive I like how this app can connect with everything that I have 
len ratingfive A great place for extra storage 
len ratingfive This app is also great because I can access my files with all the app that are compatible with files 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work Google 
len ratingfive I run my entire business files storage and podcasting history since on my TB of Google Drive storage 
len ratingone Never works always glitching very bad
len ratingfive Best app for big files
len ratingone  Very difficult to use many poor design choices 
len ratingone Tne app version is a mess 
len ratingone If the most talented tech people work for Google it is a sorry world we live in 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingone  I hate homework it is so stupid and gay
len ratingtwo Wont allow me to download any video to my iphone 
len ratingtwo The whole reason why I downloaded this
len ratingfive I love the fact that it works with Google Classrooms 
len ratingfive Right there you can copy a link for a photo video that you took right off Google Classroom and can t copy it but with Google Drive you can copy the link and add it to a post even add it to camera roll I believe unlike you can right on Google Classroom 
len ratingfive Very useful deserves a full for sure 
len ratingfive Available for use at all times and always right at your fingertips for all my documents 
len ratingone Trash
len ratingfour I now this new coved is scary 
len ratingfour Yeah I know all of were I live all the schools are not open 
len ratingfour And that s not a bad idea but I know that s has nothing to do with the app 
len ratingfour Well maybe it does because now that we can t go to school so we re using it a lot and it s a really good app but I want to tell you this So tomorrow is a school day and we normally draw on a scratch pad 
len ratingfour And we did then breakfast then I grabbed my ipad could have grabbed my phone 
len ratingfour And started to watch YouTube then it was school so I did my assignments so I went to the app it toke me to we re I needed to go and all the links 
len ratingfour When I was supposed to go to a YouTube read a loud it toke me to a cat page on googol and then I realized that I had not pressed the right thing You guys that are yelling at me through the phone saying that s your fault I just think everything should be more like the same as at school for all electronics So all though this long review has probably got you nowhere so I just want to say be aware that it might not be as good as it seems And no GOOD BYE 
len ratingfive Great fun day for Valerie n Matthew Betts Wish you the best 
len ratingfive Live life to the fullest love Mom n Dad 
len ratingfive  Google Drive has come a long way

len ratingfive I absolutely love using Drive makes all of my work and home projects so much easier 
len ratingfive  It is a very good app
len ratingfour Works well
len ratingone I hate this app it s slow and doesn t work

len ratingfive I love this app because I can do school work and fun stuff and I can put pictures on the stuff thank you for make this app and thinking of this it is so cool i love how you can make cool stuff and rite words on the things 
len ratingfive Awesome app

len ratingone April I see recent update did not see Dark Mode yet 
len ratingone I am wait for your answer 
len ratingfive Best app ever
len ratingfive Add dark Mod
len ratingthree Organization of work and simplicity of sharing with others could be improved
len ratingfive  Tickle feet 
len ratingfive Like
len ratingfive I use pop
len ratingfive  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU 
len ratingfour I love it but really miss the convince of having your Google Photos being automatically synced with your Google Drive 
len ratingfour I hope that returns 
len ratingone I have sync into tow pc but discovered lost most of my files later found the sync move a lot files to the trash on my pc each time make sync files make it tow hard and most the time my files disappear and found that lat when looking to the files I need not in drive or PCs it cause lost my work and my time and not found any where in trash
len ratingfive I use drive and docs all the time 
len ratingfive I write stories and song lyrics and make forms for work on it 
len ratingfive Keeps me organized and I can share with people 
len ratingfive The spelling corrector thingy is helpful too don t wanna sound like an idiot 
len ratingfive I can do anything litally with drive
len ratingfive It is just wonderful 
len ratingfour Because of the virus I have needed google drive 
len ratingfour It is free and you should also get docs to write I need it and it s free witch is good but it s slow and takes up a lot of space on my device 
len ratingfour I recommend it if needed but matey use an online version of it on a computer 
len ratingfour  I like bunnies 
len ratingone Here s your review 
len ratingone Stop bothering me 
len ratingfive N
len ratingfive great
len ratingone No sound
len ratingfive Best app ever
len ratingfive It s great
len ratingthree One drive and dropbox have document scan feature from ages i just cannot understand why google cannot add the feature 
len ratingthree Even new comers like Adobe Cloud have it 
len ratingfive We use Google Drive for work 
len ratingfive It s a TV production where we have crews in different locations and we need living shared ever changing documents to be readily available to all 
len ratingfive It s great because I can see who is working and what they re writing all the time 
len ratingfive The one big negative for me is the home screen 
len ratingfive I would like it if we could clean up the view so the home screen can look exactly the way you want it to without having all the recent documents listed 
len ratingfive You can set it so that you view according to type or most recently viewed but I d really like it to be cleaner with just the one of two main folders visible 
len ratingfive But otherwise it s a great product 
len ratingfive It took me a while to figure out because I m old and in the way 
len ratingfive But now that I do have it figured out it s way more user friendly and convenient to send large messages 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive During this self quarantine time google drive has been a great tool to stay in touch I am happy and glad to be using this great tool
len ratingfive Simple and for the most part straight forward 
len ratingone Computer version is top of the line but this mobile phone version needs a lot of work 
len ratingone The very first thing should be an option to remove the recently viewed on the home page 
len ratingone This could be a security breach amp it needs to be fixed ASAP if not sooner 
len ratingfive Perfection and that s what they provide
len ratingfour It wiz ok
len ratingfive  I m really enjoying this app and I want you to make it more fast
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Absolutely Love it 
len ratingfive Works super well and doesn t have any issues 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingone  Terribly slow buggy with awful zipping file download system 
len ratingone Selected a bunch od working files that were super important Gdrive just automatically zipped all separate files into the same zipped folder even though I didn t want this 
len ratingone Took forever to upload it even with high speed internet 
len ratingone When I came home and opened the folder BAM half od the files were missing 
len ratingone Thanks Gdrive 
len ratingone I rated it one star cause the overall rating is misleading 
len ratingone This app is stupid
len ratingfive Working from has been seamless with Google Drive thanks Google 
len ratingfive Thanks again
len ratingfive My school uses google drive a lot to make class work documents and quizzes 
len ratingfive I highly recommend it for this stuff along with writing books on docs and slides and making videos on YouTube 
len ratingfive There s no doubt that Google is making lots of money from this 
len ratingone It s not uploading my video even though the same process worked for the other two videos
len ratingone This app is a pain to use 
len ratingone It is not intuitive 
len ratingfive Using this on my phone is very confusing and it s gets messy 
len ratingfive I m a student and this is very helpful but I would like it to become more organised
len ratingfive Super resource for teams working on moves and form using distance coaching 
len ratingfour  Great in many ways 
len ratingfour Too many to list 
len ratingfour An area to improve is ease of moving file folders from on drive to another I e 
len ratingfour one email to another 
len ratingfour This is a huge deal as a teacher enough to take away a star 
len ratingfive This app reminds me so much of The Classic Wii 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Need to access videos sent by teachers 
len ratingone Very difficult
len ratingfour Drive is always fun but it omg omg I cannot day is that I was going home today to my dad so that we had some fun and fun things were done to him I just didn t mean anything I was just telling him what he feels and I know what to say to 
len ratingfive It s a great app if you want to keep your work organized 
len ratingfive You can create write insert and share 
len ratingfive You have the choice to choose what you want your work on 
len ratingfive I recommended this app 
len ratingtwo It takes forever to load I want it to load quicker on some devices
len ratingfive  It is difficult to upload videos 
len ratingfive Shared drives have been regarding editing making copies or removing files 
len ratingfive Stories and more go in to this app 
len ratingfive The world needs the app 
len ratingfive It makes the world a better place with Joy and Happiess
len ratingone I cannot download app 
len ratingone  run by demons
len ratingfive TTh

len ratingfive Simple to learn how to use 
len ratingtwo Ok google 
len ratingtwo I like your apps but I forgot my password and when I click forgot password it tells me to insert my password 
len ratingtwo What am I supposed to do about that 
len ratingtwo Also my parents are older than 
len ratingtwo When I come to make a google account for them and enter their age it tells me I need a google parent account so I did that and the account didn t work so I can t use it 
len ratingtwo This is very very annoying 
len ratingtwo Please upgrade your app to make it easier to use 
len ratingtwo Also when I try to sign in you give me this random letter sequence 
len ratingtwo Every time I try to type it in it says I m wrong so now I can t use my account on ANY apps 
len ratingfive  I love how this app is not affected by Covid I love how this
len ratingfive Like this app great saving video that matter
len ratingfive Fix the posture of arms length and focus on the bounce
len ratingtwo  Always crashes when going through folders 
len ratingtwo Really fudges up the quality of even RAW files makes them incredibly pixelated 
len ratingtwo Why isn t there an export as option 
len ratingtwo That would be great 
len ratingfive i use this for school and it s amzing
len ratingfive Yup
len ratingone hard to send attach pics to classroom 
len ratingone hard to understand and navigate
len ratingfive Great job Matt 
len ratingfive Another home run 
len ratingfive Is very good
len ratingone  Don t download it

len ratingfour I like the extra added security of that 
len ratingfour Bring it back please 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone While selecting CR files on iPad Pro rd Gen Version to upload to Google Drive my file selections get reset after tapping a dozen or so 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingone App version 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingfive I ve always used an Android phone and could print easily 
len ratingfive Thought I d try an iPhone but was disappointed it was hard to print from 
len ratingfive This made it easy 
len ratingfive Buen sima APP
len ratingone It s ok
len ratingfive It s sooooooooooooooo OP 
len ratingfive  Great 
len ratingone Hate it
len ratingone I want to replace a document and I can t delete the old one
len ratingone Doesn t open every file type
len ratingfive Using this program allows needed information to be shared efficient and effectively 
len ratingtwo Google drive is amazing but it can note you sharing multiple pdf files with email but you can sharing all with the link 
len ratingtwo There s a lack of some features and needs to improve UI 
len ratingfive Drive is a really great helpfully app you can use it for anything 
len ratingfive I love this
len ratingone I am trying to simply send a message from my iPad w photo from attached and since having this as an option am stuck 
len ratingone Don t and didn t want this and I am getting extremely frustrated 
len ratingone It would help if I could talk easily to google 
len ratingone Yikes 
len ratingfive I like it comes in handy all the time
len ratingfive It s overall a good app and definitely not a waste of space 
len ratingfive Did
len ratingfive This is a great way to save your documents I been using this for years
len ratingfive  Can t beat Google Drive when it comes to being an amazing cloud platform built for collaboration 
len ratingone Have trouble remove items from drive 
len ratingthree  It s a challenge to find documents sometimes 
len ratingthree When a document is shared with me it s difficult to find it 
len ratingthree Then even though I have permission to edit it doesn t always work 
len ratingthree Also I will attempt to put a document in a folder I am currently creating the folder creates but it won t upload the document in the same task it fails 
len ratingthree So I have to go through the process again 
len ratingthree It s a recurring problem 
len ratingthree I can anticipate that if I m creating a new folder it will take multiple attempts to upload a document 
len ratingthree This should be one smooth process rather than multiple attempts required 
len ratingthree Also often I can see the document in a folder I just uploaded 
len ratingthree It should be visible 
len ratingthree I have to exit THEN go back in and most times I can only then view the doc I just uploaded 
len ratingthree These issues waste a lot of time and energy 
len ratingthree I shouldn t have to go through repetitive steps to achieve being able to view successful upload 
len ratingone Horrible it is so laggy I have good WiFi horrible horrible
len ratingone  Seriously it s and you don t have a way to copy an entire folder within the Google Drive app 
len ratingone Google you are so behind the times 
len ratingfour  It is recommended to change icons to suit those who pursue perfection 
len ratingfive Works very well
len ratingfive Copy save and be happy with Drive 
len ratingfive  that simple

len ratingfive Drive is the best app it makes me feel like home somewhere we re I can store my special memories I would definitely buy this if it came on sale on my phone 
len ratingfour Great storage space for my needs 
len ratingone  Apple inform que las Apple ser an compatibles con todas las generaciones de los iPads 
len ratingone Estoy tratando de bajar esta app por necesidad y me dice que no puedo 
len ratingone Es totalmente innecesario yo tener que salir a comprar un iPad que la m a est buena solo porque Apple no permite bajar las app que uno necesita en el equipo que ya le compro y que tiene y que funciona 
len ratingfour U know when you are trying to select some photos to put in a folder I wish you could just do it how u do it in photos By just sliding your hand across the photos that u want to put in because it s Wayyyy easier And that would make me use this app wayyy more than I am using it now And also if u do it in about months Then I would appreciate it 
len ratingfive Love the accessibility it gives me on the go to write on a regular schedule 
len ratingfive Why don t you have this app already

len ratingfive Very helpful
len ratingthree I switched from drop box to google drive for my main source of work files 
len ratingthree What I am surprised with is that the google drive app does not give the option to scan a document with your iPhone camera to save it as a PDF 
len ratingthree Can this been seen in the near future 
len ratingthree Overall I love google drive but I only downloaded the app in hopes of using that feature 
len ratingfive Google Drive seems to get interpersonal communication matters accomplished with efficiency 
len ratingfive Thank you to Google for creating and administering a good product

len ratingfive Tt
len ratingfour It is really great that I don t have to go onto my computer but Iacks a lot of the main things on the computer I would give this a if you couldn t access all your personal photos and add those 
len ratingfive Drive is a very fun and productive app for people of all ages
len ratingthree I decided to use Drive due to the storage space I opted for when I signed up for G Suite 
len ratingthree Unfortunately there are several bugs that make it difficult to use 
len ratingthree For one the nature of my business requires me to upload pictures at a time 
len ratingthree The application basically crashes if I try uploading more than images at once major pain 
len ratingthree I contacted their customer service for help but got nowhere with them 
len ratingthree Also you can t see the whole file name on your phone so having long file names won t allow you to differentiate one file from the next 
len ratingthree The upload issue is the most critical and might be the deciding factor in whether or not I continue to use Drive 
len ratingfive Best storage app since my Apple iCloud storage is way too awful to get more storage for a dollar a month and crap and I ain t going to waste my itunes money on more iCloud storage to get more so stick to googles products like google photos and drive
len ratingone Poco espacio
len ratingfive So beautiful to have all my files saved on one platform

len ratingfour Hfy is a time dwhen even free fyfy
len ratingfive Google is just awesome 
len ratingfive  Panda lol
len ratingone Well it s that time again folks 
len ratingone Apple has fouled up something on their iTunes App Store servers and so those of us who are still using iTunes for Enterprise iOS device support and management are unable to download new purchases from the store and update existing apps 
len ratingone When you clock the download button in the App Store you see a message Downloading but nothing happens and no error message appears 
len ratingone Similarly if you click the update button on an app update or the Update All Apps button you will see the same Downloading messages but nothing will actually download and you ll see no error message to explain why 
len ratingone This happens for every single app in the app store and every single update shown in the iTMS app updates interface 
len ratingone Maybe the Big Brains at Apple have chosen this particular moment to finally silently cut off all iOS app download update methods except those done via the iDevice s individual App Store interfaces making it impossible for IT managers to control app purchase update rollouts across all of their devices in anything other than an anarchic catch as catch can fashion 
len ratingone Or maybe they ve just bungled their backend app update servers like they seem to do with increasing frequency throughout these last few years of continuing decay and cr pification of Apple s feeble Web Services offerings 
len ratingone As usual Apple support aren t listening to end users who submit error reports for this issue so the only recourse for us is to pass the buck by giving one star reviews to every app update that s affected in the hopes that developers with money on the line and access to actual iTunes Technical Support as opposed to the teenage babysitters assigned to deal with lowly end users can get the problem fixed sometime before the next ice age arrives 
len ratingone As of on Monday March this is the list of app updates I ve found that exhibit this problem AT amp T Call Protect BestParking Blue Shield of California CARR DocuSign DuckDuckGo Cornell University s eBird Epocrates Eventbrite Fandango File Hub Garmin Explore Google s Gmail Google Drive ibotta IMDB Medium Microsoft OneDrive MyTSA Netflix Nextdoor O Reilly Publishers OmniFocus ParkWhiz Periscope Live Video Streaming Photoshop Express Priceline Progressive Insurance Reddit RegEx Lab Rocket Chat Route Package amp Order Tracker SmallFish Chess Snapchat Songkick Spotify StubHub Sync Secure cloud storage Ticketmaster Travelocity Waze WordPress Yahoo Sports YouTube Zomato Track

len ratingone So idk who decided to make the new update it works really well for desktop but the mobile format is all weird now 
len ratingone And by all weird I mean it s hot garbage 
len ratingone Suggestions stop trying to organize every different function into a little subsection of the app Why is there a priority tab and a workspace tab 
len ratingone It feels like I m working with different Drives than one cohesive thing On desktop the priority bar that s on top of All files is amazinggg to work with On mobile it s hot trash As a person who loves google products and uses google drive often please make the formatting the same on both devices 
len ratingone Also can y all explain what a Workplace is 
len ratingone For people who know how to use it it can be amazing but for people who have been organizing their work into Folders it seems rather pointless

len ratingone Make it possible to save multiple photos at once 
len ratingone It makes no sense that in the year this app still does not have such a simple feature 
len ratingone Also the app is EXTREMELY slow at uploading images videos and you guys don t even save them at full quality 
len ratingone For a multi billion dollar company you guys don t know how to make a simple efficient app 
len ratingfive Google drive makes it so easy to send files 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingthree Google drive is a very good product overall and I find it very useful but when I try to upload videos from my phone it takes a ridiculous amount of time to upload a minute less video I have been waiting for over an hour but a minute video takes only a minute or so l just don t get it they need to make the upload times faster and the only reason I m using this app is to upload videos to download them on my computer so please fix it

len ratingthree I have turned to other applications 
len ratingthree Carga mucho en cargar las fotos

len ratingthree So I love Google Drive to use on my chrome book for school and when I downloaded this I assumed Score 
len ratingthree All in one But when I opened and attempted to edit a slide I had it said that I had to download Google Slides to use it in Google Drive 
len ratingthree Which was a little upsetting because my parents have to approve the apps I get and my dad who usually does the approving non approving is not a techy guy 
len ratingthree Bc of this he was not fond of approving all of these apps 
len ratingthree So now I can only use google slides 
len ratingthree So what s the point of Drive 
len ratingthree But on a computer don t worry 
len ratingthree It should be automatically installed 
len ratingthree Just a warning for a phone 
len ratingthree So thanks if you read to here 
len ratingthree Heh I know it was long sorry bye

len ratingfive Guardo mis libros y cuando viajo o estoy esperando en cualquier sitios sigo leyendo es un exito
len ratingfour Google files is great but there s not multiple item download to your phone

len ratingtwo Not as easy to use as dropbox 
len ratingtwo Hard to send files from my phone 
len ratingtwo Too much difficult security
len ratingfive Google Drive is Amazing 
len ratingfive I lake so much to have all my data in my hand 
len ratingfive It is really useful
len ratingfive I loved this app because you can do school presentations and many more things
len ratingtwo Tryrashh
len ratingfive Very Convenient and practical to use 
len ratingfive Can help to be Organized can use in your Tablet or Smart Phone 
len ratingfive I love how I can all my files no matter what computer or device I m on 
len ratingtwo Does not play well with iPad 
len ratingtwo Like it s horrible on iPad 
len ratingfive Love Drive 
len ratingfive Just wish I could send documents to my messages easier 
len ratingfive I don t know how to do that without going through a bunch of hoops 
len ratingfive  I ve given it stars I have enjoyed having drive I have always had android phones until my recent Moms iPad crash we were told if someone owned an iPhone in our family it might help us recover our accounts we had iPads we had for over years and when they changed there policies to a modes of verification for our protection one had to be a phone number amp if you didn t have a Apple iPhone I remember having to call and they helped with a work around for the problem now because they say it s privacy issues if I don t know the phone number used I can t recover the acct well the problem is I have never owned a phone that ended with zero s and because I locked myself out of my acct they said I would have to send in the receipts that I own the iPad then they could help me then I got some one honest who said even if I did that I will still lose access to everything stored because it hadn t been backed up for so long I think that is just awful customer service for a long term customer who has spent thousands of dollars with them of the years and they can see that by looking at my receipts and my email account that was registered to them it just pains me I am disabled and I had bilateral knee surgeries and then began having grandmal seizures and do not remember anything from that entire year which is just awful I missed so much so I am so glad I had the drive to back up my files and picture from my old phone at least that was comforting as I have lost enough of my picture and videos of my children I cannot get back now they where on the ipads under the id like they told me was all I needed to use 
len ratingfive sorry for the novel but it was the only way to tell you how awesome your product is to me
len ratingfive Oyuna Furman is a genius brilliantly crafting a cinematic masterpiece so wealthy in tone texture sound and cinematography 
len ratingfive A pleasing blast to all senses of the human soul 
len ratingone Xlsx files won t open 
len ratingone This screen that I am typing on is white on white text to background 
len ratingone Hope it makes sense 
len ratingone I wanted to move files to a new folder 
len ratingone Somehow the app selected every file from every folder and moved them all into the folder I only wanted those files in 
len ratingone On the app after I selected the files and clicked move it said it was transferring over files 
len ratingone It did not give me an undo button like the tech support said it should have 
len ratingone Either way what is the point of seeing an activity log when you can t undo anything in the log 
len ratingone The tech guy said according to the activity log I did in fact move all files 
len ratingone But google doesn t even allow you to move files from multiple folders at the same time 
len ratingone Multiple folders yes 
len ratingone He said the only solution was for me to move them all back manually 
len ratingone Epic fail google drive 
len ratingone Need zip ability
len ratingfive I on applesauce
len ratingone Thank
len ratingfive This app is great and has helped me so much 
len ratingfive I love making documents 
len ratingfive THANK YOU 
len ratingfive Google you no
len ratingfive good 
len ratingone  Eyyy
len ratingtwo Background Activity seems to cause huge battery drop 
len ratingtwo Over the last ten days Google Drive spends hours yes HOURS on back ground activity 
len ratingtwo No other apps are even close to this amount of background work 
len ratingtwo This happened before and re installing the app solved the issue 
len ratingtwo However I d give a star review only when this issue is fixed 
len ratingthree I really wish you had editing tools for photos because that is the biggest thing you are missing 
len ratingfour I love using google drive 
len ratingfour It s simple effective and free 
len ratingfour Files are easily shared and group projects are a breeze when everyone s work can be updated and commented on in real time 
len ratingfour Google drive and all of its sub services docs slides sheets are very easy and effective on the computer however on mobile they struggle 
len ratingfour Having to switch between apps just to edit projects is more of a hassle than it might sound it is very annoying when working and navigating between different folders and mediums 
len ratingfour I would love to see google integrate docs slides etc 
len ratingfour into the google drive app 
len ratingfour This would mean less things to worry about and less confusion and complexity for mobile users 
len ratingfour Other than the separation of the separate services into different apps I love google drive and it s features 
len ratingthree  No dark mode
len ratingfour This is App app they don t use on my phone very often but it s perfect for organizing files and things you need in a daily life
len ratingfive This truly is amazing 
len ratingfive I use this all the time when I m at school home car 
len ratingfive It works so well and I may be young but I love it 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingtwo Maybe it s just be but this is not user friendly on my iPhone
len ratingfive Google is a life saviourI can t think of a day without it 
len ratingtwo I I can t watch my video
len ratingone It seems ItI am sick
len ratingfive It is amazing but sadly my mother let me uses it for studying and I don t like studying 
len ratingthree Don t
len ratingtwo No lock on google drive make it easy for anyone that takes your phone to have access to your personal files which to me is very bad
len ratingthree Why do you have separate apps for each thing 
len ratingthree Google slide has its own and there is two more apps of this type 
len ratingthree Why not just one one app for the whole thing 
len ratingfive Help me complete stuff on the internet and not do it on paper
len ratingone Ir doesn t work well 
len ratingfive Good App
len ratingfive It is so easy to use and love that it stores all your information even if the computer shuts down 
len ratingthree  I can t preview some of my videos
len ratingfive I like driving my car
len ratingone  Khan Khan Khan Khan
len ratingfive best
len ratingfive Google Drive has opened up a means of maintaining a virtual library accessible to me on almost any device from which I need to access it 
len ratingfive I recommend Google Drive to anyone who has a need for quick accessible knowledge 
len ratingfive Only problem when I check in Remove is not on the list 
len ratingfive I have to click Search Drive to be able to Remove a picture that I have duplicated very aggravating 
len ratingfive Why is this a problem on this App 
len ratingfive I love being able to use the google drive app on my phone so I can seamlessly accomplish things wherever I am 
len ratingfive So easy to use for collaborations 
len ratingfive As well as cloud access to all your important files without dealing around an external flash drive or laptop 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive I love soooo this google drive
len ratingfive Con esta aplicaci n Tengo la posibilidad de tener acceso a toda mi informaci n en diferentes dispositivos me encanta
len ratingfive  I m a grain originator for two ethanol plants 
len ratingfive I found this tool to be super handy when I visit farmers at there houses 
len ratingfive All I need is there address so I can make a dot at there farm site and get instant gps direction 
len ratingfive I love the fact that I can make notes on the points i made so when I visit them again I can look back at the notes and remember names and how the conversation went 
len ratingfive The one thing that really needs to get fixed is when I zoom in on the dots they disappear and when I zoom out they come back 
len ratingfive I wish they would not disappear so I can tell if I stopped there already or need to stop there 
len ratingfive When you zoom out the dots come back but I can t click just click on the one cause I have literally thousands of dots on the map that I scouted out and can t click on the right dot 
len ratingfive Hopefully this gets fixed soon otherwise I will find a different source to use 
len ratingfive I love google drive and I know others will too 
len ratingfive Please fix this ASAP thanks
len ratingfive Gower
len ratingfive I wrote a little story and designed three different ways that parents could make it into a book 
len ratingfive It is really wonderful to be able to share this with kids so easily 
len ratingfive Love how it updates s as soon as you start to edit 
len ratingfive I can transfer files and not worry about someone looking into my account 
len ratingfive Very secure app 
len ratingfive Love Google 
len ratingfive My son
len ratingfive Awesome drive 
len ratingfive This is the greatest 
len ratingfive I was nervous at first and after I played around with it for a while it be came better for me 
len ratingfive There s a part I don t understand it s the part about you can get it 
len ratingfive I don t know if it is charging me or not 
len ratingfive I don t have a card on file nor is there a price for the offers indicating get it 
len ratingfive I hope it s not charging me at school causing an outstanding balance
len ratingfive i love this program i always use it to transform the large file to my laptop 
len ratingone  You would think this company would have their handle on making an app work on an iPhone 
len ratingone But nope can t upload anything and have to keep the app open in order for the upload to process 
len ratingone How is that even helpful 
len ratingone Google get your sh t together and fix this issue 
len ratingone You re a billion dollar corporation and yet this is the issue you cause to ignore
len ratingfive The best good
len ratingfive Make dark mode available on IOS lol 
len ratingfive I use it for everything 
len ratingthree VINGOODKHM PS
len ratingfive Smart
len ratingfive Google Drive is easy to use and easy to setup 
len ratingfive It s perfect for my school stuff
len ratingone I ve tried downloading and redownloading this app several time over various updates and actually updating files is spotty even when connected to high speed WiFi 
len ratingfive I like google drive a lot and it s easy to switch between my different google accounts 
len ratingfive The one draw back is I need a separate app for sheets greatand docs to be able to edit things
len ratingthree I absolutely love how cheap Google Drive is 
len ratingthree It s wonderful to have the option to offload files from my various devices for practically nothing 
len ratingthree That being said this app just like many other google apps both desktop and mobile is absolutely awful 
len ratingthree It suffers the same fate as most of their other apps terrible navigation not intuitive convoluted processes to do anything and a host of other issues 
len ratingthree I m not sure who s making the UX decisions at Google it seems like it may be Helen Keller but they should be canned 
len ratingthree Nothing is where it should be or where one would think it is 
len ratingthree I ve had this app for years and I still can t navigate through it without making multiple errors 
len ratingthree There is no rhyme or reason to of the design choices in this app or if there is I d love to know what those rhymes and reasons are 
len ratingthree Maybe it s some conspiracy where Google makes their apps really difficult to use so that people then have to do a google search so that they can figure out how to work google s abysmal apps 
len ratingtwo I want to send a copy of this song and
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingone  This peice of sh t it won t let me edit the dam thing
len ratingone But it feels so good to check that box 
len ratingone Unfortunately it doesn t actually work 
len ratingone For some reason I got a new phone and this application didn t switch over with all my others and it won t let me download but I can download other apps just not this one 
len ratingone Please help 
len ratingone Crashing without explanation 
len ratingfive So so easy from phone and desktop 
len ratingfive Love google 
len ratingone I uploaded several files in Jan amp Feb but they are not visible via phone 
len ratingfive Best way to work 
len ratingfour Hard to edit and can not look up pictures to add 
len ratingfour This app is good sometimes and bad to finish class work or work if you can not add pictures or photos 
len ratingfive My most treasured memories are not in a box anymore 
len ratingtwo Difficult to understand and share files
len ratingtwo There is no clear or logical explanation of how to put files into folders using mobile nor any understanding of to get mail addresses Buffon files crouch
len ratingfive I like that I can download and listen to files offline 
len ratingfive Drive is a very useful tool it helps for my assignments in school
len ratingfour I like it
len ratingfive I can keep my pictures and music in line and in any order I want 
len ratingfive I m glad this was made 
len ratingfive Good Jongoo
len ratingfive S per
len ratingone I do not like editing in google docs 
len ratingone I hate that google removes my option to edit in word 
len ratingone Yes I changed that back to editing in word but it s very difficult to maintain that option 
len ratingone Google has infiltrated everything and I m looking forward to their failure and dethroning and the next option 
len ratingfive Works great
len ratingone  Came from Dropbox 
len ratingone Compared to Dropbox this is garbage 
len ratingone Why is google drive a separate app from google docs 
len ratingone It gives the illusion that you need drive app on your phone to use docs and I don t even think that s true 
len ratingone Google should be good enough and smart enough to have there freakin apps integrated with each other in a more seamless way 
len ratingone But of course consumer technology isn t really made to work for the consumer it s just another way to generate revenue 
len ratingone So so silly 
len ratingone Like they make technology to be purposely frustrating for no reason 
len ratingfive Very useful for work and organization 
len ratingone Storage is too little and when you buy storage it doesn t had to your previous one and you have to continue to buy more storage which is a ripoff
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingfive I think this is the greatest app in App Store to extant files 
len ratingtwo I hate it 
len ratingtwo Have several different emails that are not related pH
len ratingthree The access to files permission prompt is a pain
len ratingone S
len ratingtwo Tiene muy poco espacio 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive You guys make the digital world work for me 
len ratingfive When I started long ago looking for things online your search was the only one that really worked 
len ratingfive Then you gave me Gmail WOW compared to any of the many others I tried it is totally and diversely functional 
len ratingfive And then came Drive 
len ratingfive In my business I deal with many people 
len ratingfive I constantly get unknown or incompatible files 
len ratingfive Drive has completely solved this MAJOR issue 
len ratingone App would be great if not for several consistent problems doesn t let you create new folders uploading files from phone doesn t work and randomly closes with out warning 
len ratingone Lame 
len ratingtwo Os v deos em 
len ratingtwo Ppt e as notas do instrutor n o est o salvas 
len ratingfive This app is wonderful 
len ratingfive It helps keep me organized and I can have everything I need anywhere 
len ratingfive The latest update however has caused my app to force shutdowns every couple minutes and it s getting really frustrating
len ratingfive I use it for school and you tube 
len ratingfive I love it but it should have a factor authentication 
len ratingfive My friend found my password for all my things from my library card at school and now he is the owner in things that I created and he is in things I didn t share with him 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingone This app s function on IOS is pathetic 
len ratingone It is basically useless constantly drops out and fails to access documents 
len ratingfour I did modified my documente and it doesn t modified on the cloud 
len ratingfive Good job google
len ratingone I am a kid
len ratingone  I have to export files one at a time on my iPad 
len ratingone While on Dropbox I ve been exporting multiple files on their iOS app for years 
len ratingone Sows google only hire idiots 
len ratingfive I put some books on here and can access them from wherever 
len ratingfive It s awesome 
len ratingfive  Muy buena lo recomiendo
len ratingone  I ask you many times please do it work on Dark Mode all other app of Google and Google Earth Google Voice Google other app 
len ratingone Please DO IT NOW on Dark Mode because iPadOS already have dark mode setting 
len ratingfive Great way to creat sheets and time line for my projects
len ratingfive  It let me do my school work and let me get in to my drivers really easy I really like it you should try it out
len ratingone Awful app 
len ratingone Useless 
len ratingone Don t use it period this a terrible app it always glitches out on me when I need it it just never works DON T GET IT PERIOD 
len ratingone I mean do not flip if get it ok never 
len ratingfive It is
len ratingfive  Yeah this app is awesome to store stuff so weeeeee 
len ratingone It s good for storing files that you up load however I keep getting spam that I don t want and can t get rid of 
len ratingone It won t let me delete the message or notification 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone  Bad not real
len ratingfour When I tried to play asleep it asked me for the actual files that comes with your iPad then I merged it to drive because it said I didn t have permission on files that s why it is in drive now amp then it said unsupported file type that was really frustrating and when I tried to move the file bitdefender I saved it and it wasn t there please fix this
len ratingfive It works well
len ratingfive Really good app 
len ratingfive Keeps my docs in order and organize
len ratingone Every time I attempt to open a PDF from the Google drive app on my iPad the app crashes and takes me back to the home screen 
len ratingone It is very frustrating 
len ratingtwo Need to support zip files
len ratingfour I ll be back when I m knowledgeable 
len ratingone On my regular phone there an option to download but on iPad nothing
len ratingfive One suggestion for like MP s add a ability to loop audios saved on you re phone
len ratingfive The application is closed unexpectedly when i m trying to download multiple files to my iPhone 
len ratingfive Same when moving multiple files to a folder 
len ratingfive Please fix that
len ratingfive Muy buena
len ratingfive So I m in my senior year of college I m an RA college athlete Fraternity President as well as in my schools T O P Program 
len ratingfive And this app is how I honestly keep it all together 
len ratingfive Being able to access it wherever I go and I front of anyone who may need it 
len ratingfive We also use the drive for our fraternity so that everyone has easy access to documents for events action plans and so on 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and great for a busy on the go college student or business owner in my opinion 
len ratingone The site hard to find what you want
len ratingfive This is very reliable and a good source that i can use for school 
len ratingfive All I can say is awesome 
len ratingone I have been trying to download a file for many hours and I can not do it 
len ratingone This has been an issue for a while and google has not changed anything 
len ratingone It is clear to me that they do not care enough to change something so simple 
len ratingfive Rarely have to work on weekends but had to this weekend and was able to collaborate and get the project done from comfy home and the park 
len ratingfive Transfers well from laptop to phone 
len ratingfive Hite s rule ever
len ratingfive  I love paw patrol
len ratingfive Excelente servicio
len ratingfive  Absolutely feel blessed to have met Mike and and his wonderful team 
len ratingfive Only the best 
len ratingfive Clean cars and could not be more reliable 
len ratingfive Will not go anywhere without them 
len ratingthree When I go to the open in option it takes forever please fix 
len ratingthree Because it takes to minutes to prepare the export for a second video and to minutes for a minute video 
len ratingthree And I am sure it is not my phone because my mobile service is great 
len ratingthree Other than that the app works great
len ratingfive My kids love it
len ratingfour A great place to store my files 
len ratingfour I only wish it had a little more space because it two runs out of storage space hence stars out of 
len ratingfour Especially useful for sharing MP files which are too big to send in an email
len ratingone  App crashes every minutes as I m scrolling through any file previews 
len ratingone I m a photographer and can t look at more than or pictures in a row without the app crashing 
len ratingone I can navigate the app fine without crashes until I click to view a preview 
len ratingfive This app is a great way to share files and collaborate
len ratingthree Love the availability but user friendly is a no
len ratingthree To edit users have to install more apps 
len ratingthree Why can t it have all needed features 
len ratingtwo  Can t even sort files by modification or creation time 
len ratingone This is a maze with many dead ends 
len ratingone Poor choice of navigation tools 
len ratingtwo Everytime someone shares or edits something so that I can view it it never properly shows up under notifications so I end up having to hunt it down 
len ratingtwo There needs to be more notification options because the shared one doesnt work properly or something 
len ratingone I should be able to use Google Drive just like any other drive in my network 
len ratingfive Used this my whole college career 
len ratingfive Thank you for making it easy and awesome 
len ratingfive  Fellow College Student 
len ratingfive This app is so convenient 
len ratingfive I am a dance teacher and have only recently come to know the greatness of the drive app 
len ratingfive I love that I can access all of my documents videos and music from my phone at home and don t have to be at the dance studio 
len ratingfive This app rocks 
len ratingfive Thank you for such a great product 
len ratingone Too many problems with errors
len ratingfive It s cool 
len ratingfive Free 
len ratingfive Nice 
len ratingtwo It s convenient but very slow on iPad
len ratingthree This app is great for saving items you may need in the future but it doesn t allow you to export items from one place to the next 
len ratingthree It s annoying 
len ratingthree Plus the opening of certain items can be very frustrating 
len ratingthree And Google Drive won t accept anything other than PDFs 
len ratingthree What the heck 
len ratingthree Not the best but working 
len ratingthree Not my fav 
len ratingfive This helps me keep track of all the thing it kind of like a phone file capnet
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfour I absolutely love using the app 
len ratingfour My only wish is that there was an option for some type of password lock 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive  great
len ratingfour We use Drive to transfer point files plan maps and CAD files from field to office 
len ratingfour Works great 
len ratingfour Only issue we have is viewing PDFs 
len ratingfour On the IPad the maps will stick after opening occasionally and not be movable zoom able for minutes or just crash altogether 
len ratingfour Oddly anything that won t open on or crashes constantly on the IPad will be fine on my Android phone and vice versa 
len ratingfour Overall a great product 
len ratingfour Saves tens of man hours monthly with the field being able to get data in minutes from the office with just a call or text and the office receiving data the moment it s completed in the field 
len ratingfour Beats the heck out of driving back to the office every time you need something or trying to transfer files back and forth with the clunky FTP server and it is way more versatile 
len ratingfive I wish that I would ve known about this sooner 
len ratingfive This is convenient and easy to use 
len ratingone The fact that I can t just open docs drive in the browser to access a file and instead have to download a bleeding app makes me crazy go nuts 
len ratingone ALSO DOWNLOADING A FILE IS BASIC BLOODY FUNCTIONALITY WHY IS IT HIDDEN WHY NOT JUST MAKE YOUR APPLICATION EASY TO USE GOOD CHRIST ALMIGHTY 
len ratingone Here you are you asked for it 
len ratingone Simple functionality that is either no longer available or unreasonably difficult to access
len ratingthree  Pretty good but you can t edit drawings for some reason 
len ratingfour It takes a while for a short video clip to upload through the phone 
len ratingfour Very user friendly otherwise 
len ratingthree It works relatively well though some options available on the website are not available on the app 
len ratingthree It frequently takes ages to open folders 
len ratingthree There s a lot of wasted space on the iPad 
len ratingthree It would be better if there were a dark version the large amount of white screen is hard on the eyes especially in low light 
len ratingtwo Takes a long time to load thins and when I tried making a video 
len ratingtwo It took more than hours to load and I can t play it 
len ratingtwo And it s only four minutes
len ratingthree I have to uload one pdf at a time 
len ratingfive I just use it to feel all my porn but hey it dose that well
len ratingfive I love being able to collaborate on a doc access it anywhere and share it with others anywhere 
len ratingfive Very useful for keeping track of schoolwork
len ratingfive It s great
len ratingfive This drive has save all my documents without any problems 
len ratingfive Thanks so very much 
len ratingtwo This is a confusing app for a beginner 
len ratingfive Streamlined process of getting papers done
len ratingfive We use the google tools for our business the cloud is been helpful to collaborate between our offices 
len ratingfive The best thing ever
len ratingfive The google drive team saved my relationship by recovering the permanently deleted videos and photos of me and my boyfreinds I cant thank you guys enough The best of best app ever 
len ratingfour Mis fotos
len ratingfive Cepluch
len ratingone Please fix the bug that doesn t allow anything to load so that it can be watched
len ratingfive  Poopy poopy POOOP
len ratingthree The app is awesome I have to give it credit But one you can t make pics bigger and it doesn t have google drawings 
len ratingthree They really should add that
len ratingfive Love it love it love it 
len ratingfive Recently learned about it doing my national board certification process 
len ratingfive I was saving my work on flash drive 
len ratingfive Someone called me out on it n turned me on to g drive n now i don t know how I lived without it 
len ratingfive No more nightmares about losing my work n could work on it while waiting in dr office 
len ratingone The fact you can t drag and drop files into folders go directly to folders or do any of the expected baseline stuff you would want to do with a storage app makes it borderline non viable 
len ratingone If you want to look at existing files they got you covered but that s about it 
len ratingfour Have a hard time getting download and creating files 
len ratingone Not working on my phone
len ratingfive I do use it for my business everyday 
len ratingfive Also to save my personal files 
len ratingfive  lt 
len ratingone Does not support iPad 
len ratingtwo I can t download video files to my iPhone 
len ratingthree That videos take forever to upload
len ratingfive Google Drive has been a reliable source for me to store all my files and pictures 
len ratingfive This has been useful for school and personal use mostly free of charge 
len ratingfive I find no issues with Google Drive besides some of the missing features that are on the desktop edition 
len ratingfive Excited
len ratingtwo Have beasts phone and OS this is the only app I have that crashes freezes multiple times a day 
len ratingone Would not recommend
len ratingfive Best program and app to use for you business and storage needs
len ratingfive Best storege app ever
len ratingfive ICloud Dropbox Box you name it 
len ratingfive Google Drive wins 
len ratingfive I just use it more 
len ratingfive And it is a bargain 
len ratingfive I m gonna get rid of all my other cloud based storage drives 
len ratingfive It Simplifies 
len ratingfive Google Drive 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive  This is such a good app 
len ratingfive For organizing and such good keeping 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive And I gave it a rating of five 
len ratingfive Love it you can do a lot of things on it 
len ratingfive Best of the best 
len ratingone Always shout down when uploading photos
len ratingone Clunky and not intuitive
len ratingfive Its good app
len ratingfive I have to say that somehow I managed to lose so much of my saved items and with this drive I have found many of them 
len ratingfive Thank you for this App 
len ratingfive Muy bueno y facil
len ratingthree App store is not allowing update
len ratingfive So basically this app is the best 
len ratingfive Snejkdjsjsbdd I love it it keeps everything organised and it s great on any platform 
len ratingthree Online on my phone it says I need this app to edit documents but in fact I need another please fix that
len ratingfive This is the best app ever
len ratingfive This is by far the best way to share and saved pictures and documents as well as video files 
len ratingfive You will be amazed how simple things work 
len ratingfive Thanks a million 
len ratingfive Like it 
len ratingthree Me gustar a que la app word y excel se pudieran trabajar desde las app del escritorio como lo hace onedrive 
len ratingfive  I use this at school it s awesome it saves your stuff automatically it is SO SO SO SO cool
len ratingone Drive hits a dead end 
len ratingone Tap tap tap nothing 
len ratingfive Excellent driver and his car Audi is really comfortable 
len ratingfive The driver was very helpful and professional 
len ratingfive Would definitely ride with him again 
len ratingfive Very accessible 
len ratingfive I use Drive for everything over my desktop laptop and phone 
len ratingfive I recently organized most of my files and they re accessible everywhere all collaborative and documents always up to date with the latest version 
len ratingfive I am not able to drive yet but google drive is way better 
len ratingfive It s so much easier to go to one place where all of your files stay in one place 
len ratingfive Before I could never find my files and school papers because they were roaring around somewhere in google docs 
len ratingfive Now I can find them in one of my folders in google drive 
len ratingfive Google drive is amazing and I would recommend it to any organized person 
len ratingtwo This app is not well integrated into iOS 
len ratingtwo Overall google drive is great but on iOS something as simple as dragging a file from one folder in drive to another isn t possible you have to select the file click a move button navigate through a folder path to the folder that could be directly next to the file and then click move here 
len ratingtwo Really cumbersome 
len ratingtwo Shared drives aren t accessible through the Files app on iOS either 
len ratingtwo It s also not easy to relocate things from a personal drive to a team drive on iOS 
len ratingtwo Overall the functionality of this app specifically is not great 
len ratingfive As we all know the reason for this app is to get to your docs 
len ratingfive For me it allows me to check when I get a new job without having to start my computer 
len ratingfive It also allows me to pass documents from clients back and forth 
len ratingfive Great place to backup files for easy access 
len ratingone Basically I want to get a video on my phone but I can t find a functional way of doing it and trying to watch it while in the drive app ends up with the video buffering for seconds every seconds making it useless
len ratingfive I can always count
len ratingfive This app can store so many Photos videos and much more amazing app 
len ratingfour It s kind of annoying you can t edit docs or slides without having them
len ratingone It will not save videos I uploaded to my iPhone XS Max it has over gb of free storage the video I want to download is mb yet it will not download has been an issue for months now 
len ratingone And yet I m a tech person 
len ratingfive Best
len ratingone What happened to that 
len ratingone Crazy 
len ratingfive Buena la aplicaci n
len ratingfive This application took accessibility to the next level for the fact you can access important documents stored on your drive in anywhere in the world without much hassle 
len ratingfive Totally a star
len ratingfive The best opci n for save information
len ratingfive Absolutely the best 
len ratingfive I am loving this option 
len ratingfive I am slowly putting everything on my Google Drive 
len ratingfive Accessible anywhere at any time 
len ratingone The app crashes while I m looking at photos
len ratingone This critique is not only aimed to this IOS app but to Google Drive as a whole ecosystem 
len ratingone Why would I need by default to create and give someone a link to a folder or document for that person to be required to request access to the folder later on 
len ratingone It makes NO sense 
len ratingone For web users we have to set permissions for the link to allow anyone with it to see the item 
len ratingone For IOS users enterprise users as for Feb the date of this review we can t set an item to be shared with anyone 
len ratingone The app is only allowing us to set a file to be seen by people within the organization we belong to 
len ratingone Funny right 
len ratingone That s completely useless 
len ratingtwo Using this app is nicer than using the Drive web interface but everything is just a bit off 
len ratingtwo The animations are a little funky and the controls are a little strange and the viewers don t quite work like iOS users expect 
len ratingtwo For example if you re looking at a word processing file and zoom it will automatically unzoom after a second 
len ratingtwo This makes it exceptionally frustrating to try to read anything and there s just no reason for it 
len ratingtwo The video and photo viewers have annoying quirks too 
len ratingtwo Still it s convenient to have Google Drive as an app 
len ratingtwo I m glad I have it and I use it all the time 
len ratingtwo I just wish they d take a bit more care getting the details right 
len ratingtwo It must have written by people who weren t familiar with any of the standard iOS conventions 
len ratingone Hhhhh
len ratingfour I wish to could select multiple files at once and move 
len ratingfour I have to download images one by one 
len ratingone Too many popups

len ratingfive Wish I could think of something that s not to like about that his app 
len ratingfive Life saver for sure 
len ratingfive  This app is so amazing and very efficient and helps me a lot
len ratingthree I don t need white space between each file 
len ratingthree Give me a traditional single spaced detailed file listing like the windows interface 
len ratingtwo Very hard to fill out forms on this app
len ratingfive Only He could do this thank you for opening our eyes 
len ratingfive Juanita
len ratingtwo How do you use this storage 
len ratingtwo  I love it except I keep coming back to find my previous hour of work wasn t saved 
len ratingtwo Like a chance it won t save your progress 
len ratingtwo Driving me crazy 
len ratingtwo Only other issue is sometimes hard to get wall length exact 
len ratingtwo Love it otherwise but super frustrating save bug 
len ratingtwo Emailed contact for help 
len ratingtwo App crashes every time I try to back up photos and a minute video 
len ratingone Hard to download files to albums 
len ratingone Poor design of UI and nonsense naming of operation options 
len ratingfive Noice
len ratingfive My son shared with me his recordings of his Dad playing and singing and now I am able to enjoy when ever and where ever I am 
len ratingfour Needs improved file management cut copy paste between folder structures Logic is generally good
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingone I have no idea how to use this 
len ratingone How do I delete items in the drive 
len ratingone How do I open a shared spreadsheet 
len ratingfive Life becomes very easy
len ratingone Ugh 
len ratingone Why can t you just combine the abilities of all the google apps into the drive app 
len ratingone ITS NOT THAT HARD PEOPLE

len ratingfour I started to make a check deposit and when it confirmed the images and i confirmed the transaction I received an error window that I exceeded the business day limit EL 
len ratingfour What does that mean 
len ratingfour I tried to search it on the website and did not get anywhere 
len ratingfour Do I have to wait till Monday to do this transaction 
len ratingfour How come 
len ratingfour What if it s happening again Monday 
len ratingfour What do I do then 
len ratingfour Overall I am satisfied with BankMobile in my area there is so far only one place that doesn t charges fees when I make a cash withdrawal 
len ratingfour  therefore only stars 
len ratingfive My mates are never studying the same version of a song the band is trying to master 
len ratingfive They re a bit lazy so this trims the number of excuses for not practicing hahaha 
len ratingfive As the the self appointed clerk o da works it helps me for one spot organizer 
len ratingfive In sending a file almost double the mb gmail limit Google Drive quickly made the link no problem 
len ratingfive The BIG amp terrible downside could be Google s propensity to control and manipulate opinions they don t like 
len ratingfive If you re not reading this great review we ll 
len ratingone It s so hard and annoying
len ratingfive I use this so often and so often it has saved my life and making my life easier 
len ratingfour I don t know how but these prostitutes send messages and some I haven t fully been able to get rid of 
len ratingfour I don t even know how they have my account information 
len ratingfive Really happy with this
len ratingone I see no clear path or icon to go to trash nor empty it 
len ratingone I hate this bc is so hard to find photis and to download them it takes ages to get a photo
len ratingone Every time I try to upload more than ten photos it crashes 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone Great concept but the mechanism for sharing is worthless
len ratingfive Better than sliced bread
len ratingfive Everything about the concept and the practice is helpful 
len ratingfive Saving to a shared space makes individual devices unimportant 
len ratingfive Sharing with cohorts is so easy working on shared docs keeping up with draft comments stating on track with time and momentum are all more organized and I have confidence in the system 
len ratingfive What I wish for tagging of documents across g platform and confidence that google isn t a company that s going to take over the world like Facebook has and become a political ethical monstrosity 
len ratingfive  Would like more of a Wordpress ORG open source model with a com for profit component 
len ratingfive The best and good w
len ratingfive Fantastic app for daily use of important documents 
len ratingfive This is Amazing for businesses it organizes all your files so you know exactly where to go and where to find them with the search tool 
len ratingfive This is amazing for people starting a business and for schools all around the world this app won t make you disappointed
len ratingfive GOOD
len ratingfive Super
len ratingtwo It would be better if Google Drive rules for managing files and folders were more intuitive
len ratingfive Easy to use and share the documents 
len ratingfive If you are connected to Internet then all your files are with you 
len ratingone Crashing
len ratingfive I use this app for important information and documents 
len ratingfive And it saves even if you close the app 
len ratingfive If you are reading this you HAVE to get this app 
len ratingfive And you should also get all the google apps 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Simply sync my computer and phone 
len ratingfive Well worth the price 
len ratingthree Drive meets very simple storage needs effectively But it s lacking particularly powerful search options and the use of things like metadata and tagging 
len ratingthree Some of this information is invisible in the file or even removed when it gets uploaded 
len ratingthree In depth use of metadata is the biggest improvement I can imagine for the app in its current state 
len ratingthree In Dropbox I can easily find all the files I ve shared with anyone 
len ratingthree Not in Drive 
len ratingthree Please address this 
len ratingthree It s a basic security measure 
len ratingthree I could have inadvertently created a public link or shared with too many people and there s no way to find out 
len ratingthree Sure I can figure it out by checking each file one by one by I don t have the time to check thousands of files 
len ratingthree This would be simple to implement 
len ratingthree Your competitors do it 
len ratingthree Nobody would dislike it and many would love it 
len ratingthree For now I m using Dropbox for this reason 
len ratingthree I d like to switch back because Drive is better in other ways 
len ratingthree  Your desktop app is awful but that s a whole different story and not a reason for my rating me 
len ratingfive This is a must have app to take files on your computer and transfer to your iPad 
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfive Better than Dropbox and free 
len ratingfive All you have to do is go on google drive 
len ratingfive Search up for what you are looking for and boom like magic it appears 
len ratingfive This has transformed my world 
len ratingfive I was so bogged down by my PAPERS 
len ratingfive Holding onto things just in case or trying different filing systems it just created so much clutter 
len ratingfive Now I have everything organized into digital folders with the app and I snap a pic of the papers I need to keep and can now find them easily 
len ratingfive You can upload them directly into the folder you want it in 
len ratingfive For a busy mom this is a game changer 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingone Frequently does NOT let me open docs 
len ratingfive AaaaaaaaaeddI ve never
len ratingfive MSM IS ON HERE
len ratingfour Would love if Drive had a tile view 
len ratingfour Sometimes naming conventions aren t that accurate making list view less than optimal 
len ratingfive Googles apps are puuuuuuuuuuurfect
len ratingfive The app has survived a trial run and has done nothing but good things for me 
len ratingfive Honestly I don t know why I need a separate app for it when I have it online as well as in Google Docs but it does give me access to a few things I can t get from those other sources 
len ratingfive So feel free to try it 
len ratingfive There aren t ads popping up and it is laid out pretty simply so it isn t frustrating 
len ratingfive Google has become my favorite place for everything
len ratingfive I love this app it s the best on earth but I wish you could copy and paste paper to the computer
len ratingone Redundant and stupid
len ratingfour I can t do it from the app why 
len ratingfive I think this app is good for casual and business work 
len ratingfive One problem I noticed is that long videos won t export to the camera roll 
len ratingfive I hope it is fixed 
len ratingtwo Why isn t there a security feature to enable Facial ID or a passcode to prevent unauthorized access like Dropbox has for their storage application 
len ratingtwo Can you implement this 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingfive Love this app thanks 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive I can access documents and edit them on the go 
len ratingfive Thanks google
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I use it all the time and my files are available from anywhere I happen to be 
len ratingfive This makes life so easy for me 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive I loveII love your Christ
len ratingfive Iove this app
len ratingfive  also great for collaboration
len ratingtwo great concept but they still gotta work out the bugs 
len ratingfive Yaaas
len ratingone  Please add a widgets for recent files and a widget for uploading or scanning files etc 
len ratingone Add dark mode support 
len ratingfour  Pro Google drive should be putting dropbox out of buisness they both do the same thing only google offers gb storage free and lets you upgrade to for only month were dropbox only gives you gb and then makes you pay month for more 
len ratingfour So its nice that someone like me without alot of money can actually afford to have the storage I need without worrying about losing everything if I cant afford to keep up monthly payments 
len ratingfour It cost less to pay for entire year upfront with google drive then just months with dropbox 
len ratingfour Con My only issue with google drive is latley its not letting me upload stuff through the open in feature and when I try to transfer multiple files from files app nothing gets transfered 
len ratingfour Dropbox had same issue months ago so not sure why but I hope it gets fixed as i am having to use multiple apps just to save one file 
len ratingfour If this was fixed it would deff be a star plus 
len ratingfour Suggestion My only suggestion is the same as many others if could add option to need a pin to open app as extra security that would be very reassuring 
len ratingfour Ive had to lend my phone to my kids or leave it somewere I wouldnt need to delete it completley to keep my files private 
len ratingfour People are naturally nosy 
len ratingfour Thanks Michelle
len ratingtwo Wish was more space
len ratingfive I just started a small business and google drive is great for managing my documents for my business 
len ratingfive Handy very useful 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingthree Nice make it more simple to use
len ratingfive We use this daily at work and for our hobbies 
len ratingfive  Using it daily can t live without it
len ratingfive Google docs makes everything so easy I love it 
len ratingfive  uploads speed usually slow 
len ratingtwo If you have certain access drive requires your phone to have a passcode 
len ratingtwo Which is just irritating 
len ratingtwo If I thought they were secret enough to need a passcode I would put one on my phone 
len ratingtwo Obviously someone did at some point but just make me type in my email password if I want access to those files
len ratingfive Great item we re everybody can see and edit
len ratingfour Cease loading files upon task switching to Safari then complain falsely about loss of connectivity don t resume correctly after being asked to be made available offline 
len ratingfive Google Drive is sooooooo great

len ratingone Have a gdoc titled flashlights and search flash does not find it 
len ratingone This is just one example 
len ratingone Drive would be a star product but searching is so fundamental it brings the whole app down 
len ratingone Also google is a search company 
len ratingone How is this even possible 
len ratingone Seriously how does flash not find flashlight 
len ratingfive I wish it was possible 
len ratingfive So far Mega is the only cloud storage that Ive found will do it

len ratingone I m not sure why google with its resources cannot come up with a dark mode for its apps drive and Gmail both are missing dark mode get with it google
len ratingthree What I love about the drive is the ability to upload whole folders of pictures and have them backed up in a safe place 
len ratingthree However it does not allow you to download these whole folders when you re using the mobile version and compresses the folder into a zip file when using the desktop version 
len ratingthree This is frustrating as a person with lots of pictures saved on this cloud without the ability to then take them off when they are needed 
len ratingthree Please help solve this issue 
len ratingthree  thing with google drive on mobile it doesn t have google forms 
len ratingfive Good to use it

len ratingfive A House that becomes my home 
len ratingone Why doesn t the audio feature work 
len ratingfour File sharing is awesome however I have much more trouble using Drive on my smartphone 
len ratingfour Even though I use this app I have trouble opening items or finding stuff

len ratingthree Very frustrating 
len ratingfour I have been using google drive for storing videos and as recently they stopped playing all I get a black screen with a buffering wheel and I never had problems in the past playing any of them video format is webm
len ratingfive I m really not sure how they doit but providing such an awesome intra platform communications organization production software for free is one of my favorite parts of living in this new future age 
len ratingfive I get the add clicks get the company paid but this software lets me run my business from anywhere with anything 
len ratingfive Well done
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfour There re some problem with uploading by sharing method 
len ratingfour For example if I open any file in the gmail app press sharing and chose Google Drive the process freezes immediately 
len ratingfour And I should turnoff the app 
len ratingfour Please make something 
len ratingfour Thank s
len ratingfive I HATE THIS JK I LOVE IT SM AND ITS THE GREATEST THING EVER AND LIFE WOULD BE SO MUCH HARDER WITHOUT IT
len ratingone I hate that you can not download a video file or picture from drive straight to your mobile device or phone
len ratingfive great
len ratingfive Easy to create store and locate document you may need to print out or upload to another website or email address 
len ratingone Cannot delete files
len ratingfive Drive is great it stores everything s for you and keeps it organized 
len ratingfive One of the best drives out there 
len ratingone The ap should give the option if we want our recent documents displayed
len ratingfive Simply just amazing
len ratingfive Just a file app 
len ratingfive Nothing wrong with it 
len ratingfive yay 
len ratingthree Google apps are some of the last major hold outs in implementing dark mode

len ratingfour Leider kann Google Drive keine Preview f r makemusics mus Finale Files errechnen
len ratingthree The app is designed well but keeps crashing on my iPad which of course is extremely inefficient for someone who wants to use the app to be productive 
len ratingfive I originally got the smaller Gb version I later updated to Tb to store additional stuff 
len ratingfive Where ever I go this stuff is accessible for me to use 
len ratingfive I use it down load books and make sure files is safe 
len ratingfive Also to use with my google cloud on computer I just dump files there and within a hrs time most files are up there depending on size 
len ratingfive This is good to add to ur storage files 
len ratingfive Like there s another
len ratingfive It could be better 
len ratingtwo Writing this review and it s showing the cursor moving but the screen is all white 
len ratingfive I enjoy using Google Drive because it is convenient and easy to access it whenever I need it 
len ratingfour I m just learning on this app 
len ratingfour I m really lost 
len ratingfour Any suggestions for me Kindly Roseann
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive for almost years now and I love how I can upload photos videos and other files from my computer and on to my phone 
len ratingfive The reason that this helps me is because I am a YouTuber so I like to be able to take files anywhere I go 
len ratingfour For me it s good to know how to use google drive 
len ratingfour Thanks to it I can share my videos with friends and family 
len ratingfive I read about Google drive and DOCS in an article in the LA Times about how to save money 
len ratingfive I never looked back 
len ratingfive I can access it from any computer and it is easy to learn to use 
len ratingfive Are use the spreadsheet for budgeting but there is so much more and you don t have to pay anything 
len ratingone it takes forever to download something
len ratingone Awful service
len ratingtwo Que se pueda imprimir sea que chafa

len ratingone So far I am very disappointed in google drive 
len ratingone A friend from Israel sent me an hour s worth of music and I can only listen to minutes of it at the most before the program stops 
len ratingfive Excelente
len ratingfive Guardar todo documento para tener en el celular a donde quieras que vayas
len ratingfive I used online drives in my college days to store class work and make it easier to work between my personal laptop library computers and classroom computers 
len ratingfive Having a little bit of cloud space makes data transfer and storage easier especially if I am using my iPhone and cannot connect a USB port to it 
len ratingthree I m still learning this 
len ratingthree I m not very technology savvy 
len ratingfive Amazing App 
len ratingfive  Stars 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingone It s so slow 
len ratingone I can download files that are a gigabyte from google drive on my computer and it will take several seconds if I try to download a file that s mb on my phone it takes several minutes on the same WiFi I can download large things in seconds on so many other apps like the AppStore or reddit but google drive is just so painfully slow
len ratingfour The app is great 
len ratingfour I went to a concert last may and was looking for a place to store videos on to save space on my phone 
len ratingfour This app has so much gb capacity the videos have only taken up GB 
len ratingfour My one issue is that I still have one more video to upload 
len ratingfour It s minutes long and the fact that an almost minute video uploaded and this one won t makes no sense 
len ratingfour I ll have to try multiple times to see if it will work but so far i m not sure how to fix this 
len ratingfour But nonetheless a great app 
len ratingfive Great key for businesses and large files specially in the music industry 
len ratingfive I love using Google Drive 
len ratingone My most recent pictures videos are not showing and are not saved 
len ratingone I know for sure I updated them into my drive cloud 
len ratingone Where did they go 
len ratingone Need to update
len ratingone Latest release completely broke the extension to upload files 
len ratingone Instead of taking the user directly to the folder closer for the most recent account extension pauses for several seconds asking use to select an account 
len ratingone We could always change the account why did Google need to introduce this absurdly slow and unnecessary step 
len ratingone There have been no major updates since the app was released 
len ratingone Users are still stuck with a picture and video viewer that feels like iOS 
len ratingfour I saw a video
len ratingfour If sharing settings could be as granular as the web version I would give it a 
len ratingthree I really enjoy having Drive as a feature to upload and download files to all my devices 
len ratingthree However on my Apple devices the Google Drive app crashes and closes on me frequently 
len ratingthree It s really annoying
len ratingone How many updates 
len ratingfive  Excellent
len ratingone Like a basic bait and switch at a used car dealer 
len ratingone You must agree to the undercoating for the car but the crappy tires are for free 
len ratingone Just agree to the interest rate and we can sell you the car TODAY And RIght NOW 
len ratingthree I
len ratingone It s nice having file access on my phone 
len ratingone But I feel I have no control over Drive 
len ratingone It gets files from I don t know where and then makes it really hard to get rid of them 
len ratingone I have all these very old strange files that appear out of nowhere 
len ratingone So it s hard to find and use the files I specifically saved to Drive 
len ratingone Frankly it s a nightmare 
len ratingone I d be better off carrying paper copies or maybe using Microsoft One Drive 
len ratingone Google should do better 
len ratingfive Best way to share and store
len ratingfive Great way to share files to myself at another location like the library and great way to share images and documents with one or many 
len ratingfive I
len ratingfive Works very well for what I need 
len ratingfive This app is perfect for for the busy OCD college student 
len ratingfive I can t do without storing my pics and important docs in one place 
len ratingfive G Drive is the bomb 
len ratingfour The app was taking up two full gigs of storage on my phone with no files saved offline 
len ratingfour Please include a way to clear the Documents and Data in future releases so that you do not have to uninstall and reinstall the app constantly 
len ratingfour Or just put a cap on how much it can accumulate before deleting old files 
len ratingthree Pls get dark mode thank you 
len ratingtwo experience in general
len ratingfive You have saved my life
len ratingfive  I have run my small home based business one million revenue using google drive as part of the back office infrastructure to keep employees and vendors access to all of our documents contracts and other material usually saved on servers 
len ratingfive Google drive is key to our success and wouldn t change it for anything 
len ratingfive Drive really helps me get organized 
len ratingfive It has all my presentations and projects and is great for th graders like me 
len ratingfive Well it is just that 
len ratingfive  It helps me soo MUCH with my school work 
len ratingfive Perfect app
len ratingone The one time I try to use google drive on my phone for something important it crashes repeatedly 
len ratingone I m trying to find a photo to submit for my class and I can t scroll through more than photos without the app crashing and then I have to restart 
len ratingone Whenever I m trying to do work I get interrupted and asked to write a review 
len ratingone sucksss 
len ratingone  confusing and trash 
len ratingfive Google Drive organizes and saves data saving me tons of time so I can get busy with all that is important in my life 
len ratingthree The story mode is kind of boring 
len ratingfive Please people 
len ratingfive This is the best piece of genius I have ever come across 
len ratingfive The best alternative to Microsft office but way better 
len ratingfive May the inventor live long so that we may see better innovations 
len ratingfive The app hold every document or picture you put in it I have a bunch of document haven t lost one 
len ratingfour A very handy app to help you do your work 
len ratingone  Been a frustrating experience in general
len ratingtwo Should not conflict with e mail storage
len ratingone The user needs to constantly keep the app and the screen active until the video is uploaded and processed 
len ratingone It doesn t upload in the background or when the screen locks on the smartphone 
len ratingone If you are not monitoring the uploading it s best to not upload at all because it will fail 
len ratingone Haven t been enjoying google drive 
len ratingfive It s very helpful for keeping all my important stuff so I can get to it when I need it A 
len ratingthree i don t write reviews often 
len ratingthree but this app needs it 
len ratingthree it s a very great and useful app but only for the desktop 
len ratingthree g suite apps have a significant lack of features that is very infuriating at times 
len ratingthree you need to download all the apps that google offers just to open one document on your phone 
len ratingthree what happened to google and google drive being one source for everything 
len ratingthree imo this app has needed refinement for a long time 
len ratingthree it s gotten work over the years but it s nowhere near done 
len ratingthree in order to streamline processes that most users are doing while using apps like these there needs to be a higher level of accessibility 
len ratingthree i don t want to have to download four apps just to open one document and i don t think many other people do either 
len ratingone ARW
len ratingthree Eh
len ratingfive Google drive is amazing and I use it everyday and I love being able to access my photos and Documents from it on any device 
len ratingfive One thing though 
len ratingfive The upload time for small videos min Is kinda Long 
len ratingfive But other than that it is the best 
len ratingfive It s so easy for me to organize everything I can for my business since I work from home 
len ratingfive I absolutely love it and would highly recommend using it 
len ratingfive I have found Google Drive to be incredibly useful for many things 
len ratingfive I largely use it rather unconventionally so I can listen to music without using iTunes we have a lot of music at home so I use Google Drive and GoPlayer to play music 
len ratingfive I have found Google Drive useful as a storage space as well 
len ratingfive I think it is excellent and there is just one thing I would change 
len ratingfive Could you make it compatible with the play pause button on Apple earbuds 
len ratingfive Thanks again for such a high quality product 
len ratingfive This is an useful and helpful way to type school assignments 
len ratingfive We are I m going to go to the movies and then go to the movies and then go to

len ratingfive Very useful
len ratingfive Can t complain about google drive at all
len ratingtwo When it works it s great 
len ratingtwo However it s almost impossible to work it consistantly as its constantly crashing
len ratingone  How can all apps have option to give a review before the app has been used or tested 
len ratingone This app crashes an incredible amount more so than any other iPhone app I use 
len ratingfive Before using Google Drive it
len ratingfive So nice to have your information readily available
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive Great platform for ideas love to be a beta tester for them
len ratingfive Great application 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingone I m not sure if this is just me but I can barely scroll through any of my photos without the app crashing 
len ratingone Half of the time when I m attempting to download the photos the photos become corrupted in my phones storage thankfully nothing happens to the files in my Google Drive and this only happens on my phone not on my PC 
len ratingone Please fix this app 
len ratingfive Very helpful Make my life easier
len ratingfive Fast reliable and convenient
len ratingfive this is a very nice thing and i think every one needs this and google should go to apple and ask them to have thir phones and stuff use google storage so the storage on the phones don t run out and stuff because thir are people out their in the world like my mother who loves to take pictures of her family and stuff even though they say their tired of pictures and ask when she will be done also its free which is also a plus besides storing pictures and contacts and stuff like that and stuff and things and my sister in law will also take pictures on her phone and stuff
len ratingfive  Thank you

len ratingfive Use this on multiple accounts store all of my pertinent information
len ratingtwo So I love Google and I actually moved from Dropbox because I wanted to have everything in one place until I had to share a single file but I couldn t find a idiot proof way to either download it to my phone and just send the file a photo straight to someone s phone or Facebook I love Google but it amazes me negatively why the app doesn t have such a simple yet effective feature that s just unacceptable
len ratingtwo Awesome 
len ratingfour Its a good apoication for storage but it make it easy for downloading our pics from it to our device

len ratingfive Great way to organize documents 
len ratingone portrait videos play back totally squashed and stretched but work in other drive clients
len ratingone Like nearly every single Google product Drive is a muserablevproduct 
len ratingone It has poor design functionality assessibility and user experience 
len ratingone It us as if tgry created a mousetrsp onky fir mouses who getvthemselves stuck in it 
len ratingone But whst scthe alternative anything elsevus as bad or worse 
len ratingone I m really hating this new update as soon as I updated I feel like I m using a whole different phone and the things I have in Google drive it s not even secure anymore I like I cannot have passcode password active on Google drive anyone could get into it 
len ratingone The files are in the mess it s not possible to sort by the date it doesn t show the files I saved today at all 
len ratingone It s not possible to attach the file to email as an attachment it just leaves the link

len ratingfive So glad I can access my important things anywhere 
len ratingfive Excellente application
len ratingone Photos are not uploading as fast as I thought they would also you can only select a few pictures at a time to upload
len ratingone Unfortunately the engineers at google thought it was a good idea that you might want to swipe between videos rather than exiting the current video that you were watching 
len ratingone Even as I type this review now I cannot see what I have written because this app is so bad
len ratingone Bastard ipad 
len ratingone You know what that means 
len ratingone It is print apple or rak the lawn
len ratingfive I transferred all my storage from Dropbox to Drive roughly years ago and I couldn t be any happier 
len ratingfive I ve saved money and I already use many other Google products ex 
len ratingfive Google Business amp G Suite Gmail Calendar Chrome etc 
len ratingfive I ve found that sharing folders has been much easier now over the old Dropbox account 
len ratingfive Also the app integration capabilities seem to be almost endless 
len ratingfive This app helps me upload videos to the cloud so I can make YouTube videos on my personal computer 
len ratingfive Thanks Google for GB free of charge 
len ratingthree new design is super inconvenient too much white space
len ratingfive This app makes scanning so easy and useful 
len ratingfive I ve been using this app to send important documents to anyone I ll need to send 
len ratingfive Download the app and I m certain that you will like it 
len ratingtwo Why is it so difficult to download an image from your drive 
len ratingone I can t edit or open anything
len ratingone There is always some work around that has to happen if there are any other apps involved 
len ratingone Especially if those apps are Microsoft products

len ratingfive I love google drive because it is great to work on school projects

len ratingthree Keeps shutting down on me randomly while I m looking through pictures shared with me 
len ratingfive AA
len ratingfive I am in and out of files daily and needing to upload and download to multiple sources from multiple devices 
len ratingfive Google Drive has been reliable on all devices is the simplest to use and has not had any issues 
len ratingfive I can not recommend it enough 
len ratingfive I have tried Dropbox and have experienced a host of issues with heavy usage and therefore only use Google Drive 
len ratingone Accessing my files take forever

len ratingone I don t normally do reviews but I simply want to upload via my desktop computer a mb video clip 
len ratingone I want to be able to get a link for that clip and send it via text message to a friend via the Google Drive App 
len ratingone Let me be real here that operation is nearly impossible on the app 
len ratingone Once you play the video clip it takes up the entire screen and you cannot escape full screen mode on the app and find any viable share link options 
len ratingone I have to close the entire app to even get out of video playback mode 
len ratingone This app needs serious work 
len ratingfive Love it store everything here
len ratingone Spent hours trying to deal with this horrendous app

len ratingthree Been using this app for years suddenly my documents aren t updating and certain ones will only open on computer basic word documents great app but clearly having some issues
len ratingfour The layout is absolutely horrible 
len ratingfour I mean you guys are google 
len ratingfour Like get it together guys 
len ratingtwo I can t figure out how to add files to a folder 
len ratingtwo It should be easy but it s not 
len ratingfour Cannot play wmv after marking available offline and downloading the wmv file 
len ratingfour If the file is not marked as available offline it can be played 
len ratingfour If the file is marked as available offline but has not been downloaded it can be played as well 
len ratingfive Idk what to say so yea it is good

len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive Quick access and availability for all my files
len ratingfive Esta parte de Google es incre ble poder almacenar tanta informaci n sin tener que cargar usb 
len ratingone I get spam in my spam email box and it automatically sends the file to Google Drive without permission 
len ratingone Cannot download to my phone 
len ratingfour My life as an academic revolves around Google Drive 
len ratingfour In particular Drive is able to search inside PDFs and my notes so I can find exactly the reference I need 
len ratingfour I recently have had a few bugs though changes made in the app just invisibly stopped making it to the server 
len ratingfour I lost weeks of file changes 
len ratingfour I ve also had uploads silently fail or disappear and the share sheet is occasionally buggy too dropping files on the floor 
len ratingfour All told these bugs aren t bad enough to not use the app but they are quite an annoying blemish on an otherwise stellar app
len ratingone Consumed of my battery life in the background 
len ratingone Won t let me upload pictures off phone faster than at the time
len ratingfive My daughter love it so much
len ratingone When I go to google drive I can t edit anything and it is dumb to make separate apps like google slides and google docs when you can put them all in google drive 
len ratingone I think this app is bad and it SHOULD BE LIKE ON A CROME BOOK WHERE YOU CAN GET ON GOOGLE DRIVE and EDIT It 
len ratingfour There should be a way to remove something from a shared drive 
len ratingfour Without entirely deleting it 
len ratingthree Pa mal
len ratingthree Google Drive is pretty good it s just that you can t edit your slides on it without having Google SLIDES which is a bit annoying 
len ratingthree You should change that lol 
len ratingthree But other than that it s DA BOMB DOT COM 
len ratingthree Move over glossier 
len ratingthree Anyways ya love Google you guys are amaizing just keep in mind what I said because there s prob other people complaining about this too sooo ya 
len ratingthree Byeee love you 
len ratingfive Efficient for average skills 
len ratingfive Becoming confident
len ratingfive Bruh
len ratingfive Awsome
len ratingtwo Overall I enjoy the google drive 
len ratingtwo But disappointed that video files hardly ever process 
len ratingtwo Google has failed to keep up to date codecs on its processor and player 
len ratingtwo I use it to store mp and a I from security cameras for archiving events for law enforcement 
len ratingtwo So a very valuable tool in the past to deliver footage quickly 
len ratingtwo Now cloud based is just broken and it s back to and burning CDs 
len ratingtwo Guess all good things must come to an end 
len ratingtwo I ve only been able to get a few things uploaded on here and then after I was done I permanently deleted the ones I uploaded 
len ratingtwo Now I can t seem to upload anymore stuff 
len ratingfive Iz really cool
len ratingone This new update is such bad UX 
len ratingone So counterintuitive 
len ratingfive Love to access important documents anywhere 
len ratingfive I have two GM and Google Docs accounts one personal and one professional for my private practice 
len ratingfive It is accessible from any device easy to manage and use easy to organize and just great overall 
len ratingfive This helps me a lot and I trust that my documents and information are safe 
len ratingfive Thank you Google Docs and GMail

len ratingone Too complicated mates
len ratingone Reviewing drive on iOS 
len ratingone It s a challenge since the text will not display 
len ratingone Example why something is wrong with google vs Apple 
len ratingone Drive was a decent file syncing archiving and saving utility 
len ratingone But over the past year updates have rendered it close to uselessness 
len ratingone Simple edits are not possibles thrust iOS any longer 
len ratingone Every document displays as a full page paper format with impossibly teeny text so must zoom in which then leads to Ayer another interface variations to control zoom and pan 
len ratingone Anindeucipherable mix of new and old gestures 
len ratingone It s a mess much like this review since the App review interface Wont display what I am typing 
len ratingone Just a mess
len ratingfour  Dark mode

len ratingfive  Es muy r pida la respuesta cuando se le pide la apertura de un archivo 
len ratingfive This software keeps me organized 
len ratingfive Thank u got one 
len ratingfive Inbox zero 
len ratingfive And IBM s 
len ratingone The app will never show contents of folders 
len ratingone Which wouldn t be so bad if I could bring up the desktop site on mobile but that forces you to open the app 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingone Finding another way to store my pics documents ASAP 
len ratingfive This is a great app and it is very convenient to find your school work that your teacher posted on google drive this is a great app
len ratingfive T o share large files without having to pay for it 
len ratingfive Great and easy organizational system 
len ratingfive Simple and highly efficient 
len ratingfive What not to love 
len ratingfive I love this app it s the absolute best Thank you for making such a great and helpful app 
len ratingfive Sincerely Emily
len ratingfive This app helps a lot I just wish the site and app let you edit on docs and other stuff 
len ratingfive Why is this white this is so racist
len ratingtwo For any Gsuite accounts if you share a link only those in your business can access it 
len ratingtwo The desktop version let s you were fix the link further by editing and allowing anyone with the link 
len ratingtwo The mobile app does not let you adjust those advanced settings making sharing links super difficult 
len ratingtwo I d change this to a if this big feature wasn t missing 
len ratingfive I can check everything that I have in my computer through my phone which is nice because lit can be hard to take ur computer everywhere
len ratingfive Great product and I hope they continue to make worthwhile improvements 
len ratingfive It is the most fantastic thing I ve ever seen on my electronic 
len ratingfive Good stuff
len ratingtwo the owner founder of Google doesnt feel pain at night just goes in and out of conciousness and has oh there it is sex with his wife
len ratingthree Would give stars if they wouldn t sell everything I m writing to bad people
len ratingthree Honestly I find Drive to be the most accessible and free document editor available with VoiceOver 
len ratingthree The mobile app has worked for me for creating and sharing many types of documents as well as organising them 
len ratingthree It is easy to type in text fields using a bluetooth qwerty keyboard and track my progress with a braille display For an app that years ago was not VoiceOver accessible this is a great improvement 
len ratingfive What I like about this program is it s ease of use
len ratingfive I don t want to leave Google 
len ratingfive It is too good 
len ratingfive And to google 
len ratingfive This is like VIP for the hardrive 
len ratingfive Only Google could do a job so well done 
len ratingfive People VIP welcome only lol
len ratingfive Hi I m going to be a little bit of a mom to drop off my kids at the gym and then I will drop them at home and dad is your mom is going to be there at five and then I will be at the school
len ratingone Once again I am locked out of files I need because of this crap
len ratingfive Still trying to figure out how to open files in different formats
len ratingone Every time I turn on 
len ratingone It freezes and is very jumpy 
len ratingone I am a custom home builder and rely on this app 
len ratingone So I would say it is not good 
len ratingone Come on Google you are better than that
len ratingfour Okay I ll just start off with this this is an INCREDIBLE app 
len ratingfour Great job google 
len ratingfour It is easy to organize write and get things done with or without friends 
len ratingfour However there s one star that s missing up there 
len ratingfour I used to use and still do sometimes google drive on a computer but got it on my phone because I could use it anywhere 
len ratingfour I found out recently that the only three formats are google docs google slides and google sheets 
len ratingfour On the computer there were google sites forms drawings etc 
len ratingfour There might be something I m missing but if there aren t the extra formats in yet it would so nice if you added them 
len ratingfour Thank you Google 
len ratingfour You ve been a big help regardless 
len ratingtwo So I just got this on my phone IOS and I can t add other emails to collab with th so they can see what I see but when every I try the screen zooms our and I can t tap it and it s SO Frustrating 
len ratingfive  From backup and sync to docs to accessing my files seamlessly on all my devices this ecosystem is incredible 
len ratingfive Would like to be able to annotate pdf documents like add text and draw signature and would like for docs sheets slides and notes to integrated directly to the google drive app in stead of downloading them individually 
len ratingfive One app all features 
len ratingone If I could give you zero stars I would
len ratingone I ve tried over and over to save a video to my camera roll because I was trying to get it from my laptop to my phone 
len ratingone Only way I could do it was through drive and it won t let me save the video to my phone 
len ratingone Just gets stuck on a preparing to export screen 
len ratingfive This is wack
len ratingfive I love being able to swipe left to see the next doc 
len ratingfive It s so convenient 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Use this google tool for my business and I love it
len ratingfive This is a great app
len ratingfive N o tem pre o receber um arquivo do filho
len ratingone When someone gets gamejolt on phone and uses this app it doesn t work
len ratingtwo Many issues with google drive 
len ratingtwo The interface has always been confusing on the desktop but it is even more so on the iPad 
len ratingtwo Still haven t figured out how to get a file out of the drive once it is saved in it 
len ratingfive Great service 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive I use this to send videos I create to my phone from premiere and it s perfect 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Drive is a wonderful source to have information readily stored and available 
len ratingfive Wherever I am and whether device I use my information can be retrieved 
len ratingfive Buenosimo
len ratingone Normally works fine but I updated the app and it s not even opening 
len ratingone I had to log in through a browser to get to my files 
len ratingfive I really enjoy to have my things in my drive so I can look them up and be able to use them when necessary 
len ratingfive  Thank You 
len ratingfive forced writing DOESN T WORK forced writing DOESN T WORK forced writing DOESN T WORK
len ratingone I can t access my shared drives and every time I tap something I get a notification telling me to set a passcode on my device when there already is a passcode set on my device 
len ratingfive Drive helps me to do my school work and it is very helpful because if I didn t have I would not to be able to do my school work
len ratingfive We are a mini market and sharing different documents such as inventory prices reports and more makes it easy for all out locations to stay connected 
len ratingfive We use it daily 
len ratingfive Highly Recommend 
len ratingone  Why can t I use FaceID or a password to secure the app 
len ratingfour From day one of installment I ve love this App 
len ratingfour It allows me to upload download whenever and wherever I want 
len ratingfour Perfect for a photographer and for regular business use altogether 
len ratingfour MyDrive 
len ratingtwo The biggest thing missing from drive that s unrelated to the app is the ability to add labels 
len ratingtwo Yes you can use folders or add a star but labels revolutionized GMail it would be nice to see the same on drive 
len ratingtwo Secondly if you store a video on drive it does not play well with iOS 
len ratingtwo It takes multiple taps to reveal the player buttons the player buttons do not feature sec rewind or sec advance 
len ratingtwo Also AirPlay always fails 
len ratingtwo Both iPhone and iPad versions to the newest Apple TV s 
len ratingtwo Do the basics work and work well 
len ratingtwo Yes but that s not good enough for google and its products 
len ratingfive I love enjoying Google Drive it gives me time to get stuff done from within like homework and also one thing I know these things are copyright but Disney movies have been the best for me gotta love Disney 
len ratingfive I love God and Jesus and Disney 
len ratingfive Everything is Awesome in a good way 
len ratingfive Best thing to do
len ratingone fix your garbage 
len ratingone hasnt loaded pics in a while
len ratingfive This is the first time using this app and so far it s performing very well 
len ratingfive Still learning the apps 
len ratingfive I will update my review after a week 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone It is slow and it keeps closing on me and won t let me copy the videos to my photos 
len ratingfour Google Drive works well most of the time but with a folder on Google Drive s cloud storage when swiping through a folder full of JPG images approx megapixel photos on my iPad after about a dozen photos the app just crashes suddenly 
len ratingfour This is a real nuisance 
len ratingfour There s no error message the app just closes 
len ratingfour This seems like basic functionality 
len ratingfour Please Google take a look and fix this bug 
len ratingone Disappointed in how useless it seems compared to it ran on an android os
len ratingone The app keeps crashing whenever I try to save shared photos to my device 
len ratingone EVERY SINGLE TIME 
len ratingthree Not sure if apple or google is at fault but my drive is never up to date in the files app and the only way to fix it is to reinstall google drive 
len ratingthree If this app had the option to immediately save images to my gallery or use the built in file system I would use it instead of the files app 
len ratingfive Great for my work flow easy to used on Android as is on IOS
len ratingfive From page size to spacing to page design elements all can be better
len ratingfive Excellent app for all work 
len ratingfive I am so thankful to have a place to store sentimental photos and videos 
len ratingfive This is the best online app for documents
len ratingfive I thought why not try to see if I can actually follow these instructions 
len ratingfive And lo and behold it was easy and it worked 
len ratingfive Thanks a lot 
len ratingfive It means that a lot of reviews are kind of notes from a hostage 
len ratingfive Cheap way to feel powerful 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfour it s really annoying that you can t upload files in the background you can only continue uploading while your in the Google Drive app and it still doesn t even do it when your phone is on sleep 
len ratingfour and sometimes it randomly has to retry for no reason and you should let us share multiple files with people at once instead of doing them individually also even if you just go out of the app and to another app or even just to the home screen then when you come back to Google Drive even if you ve only been gone for literally one minute then it ll either say waiting on your already previously partially uploaded file and sometimes it ll start back at where it was but some very unfortunate times it ll restart the entire upload for no reason please fix this and most of all let them upload in the background please 
len ratingfive Helpfulo
len ratingthree When I watch videos on here the home bar on the iPhone X doesn t go away while on other apps like YouTube it does 
len ratingfive This program help me so much in working on my class work 
len ratingtwo It disappeared in a recent update and never returned 
len ratingtwo The app is much weaker without it
len ratingfive It s good
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Easy to use since I m a senior citizen 
len ratingfive This app is very user friendly 
len ratingfive It is a Very good app
len ratingfive Google Drive is a great tool to manage many documents and files and stay organized and up to date with all of your business and personal tasks 
len ratingfive The mobile app makes it very convenient to pull up any important document you may need to reference on a regular basis 
len ratingfive I recommend google drive to anyone looking to stay organized and on top of things 
len ratingfour It would be nicer is when I upload a photo from my pc that I could put it into the photos in my phone 
len ratingfive Fast and convenient
len ratingfive Lovely work comes through 
len ratingfive Great picture quality 
len ratingfive Mm
len ratingfive i can not find how to use pass word for my drive
len ratingthree Using the workspace feature feels redundant on the app as workspace should be allowing me to access specific files easily going from one to another fast and quick 
len ratingthree However when I try to use the files I ve moved into the workspace it will bring me to into another google app which does not give me access to the workspace that I created unless I go back to the drive app and relaunch workspace again which in my opinion makes workspace feel redundant on the google drive app 
len ratingthree I had the app when docs sheets and slides were all integrated into this app 
len ratingthree I think the workspace feature would greatly benefit from this 
len ratingthree Drive is great as a central hub and I like how it is organized but that organization feels again redundant if you have to switch between different files and different apps 
len ratingthree Drive feels like a middle man that could be cut 
len ratingthree And the only reason that it isn t cut is that the other apps can only view their respective files i e 
len ratingthree docs can only view documents 
len ratingfive Omg best 
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingone Where s the Trash button on this crappy thing 
len ratingfive  Google always have been my favorite thing and this is part of google so it helps me with all my needs better then Siri
len ratingfive I use drive more than the files on my laptop 
len ratingfive It s great for staying organized
len ratingone Taking too long to download video
len ratingthree I find it good for writing something but if you need to upload a video short or long it will literally take over minutes 
len ratingthree I m trying to upload short video to my google drive RIGHT NOW for school but I ve only gotten on there in the span of minutes and it keeps re uploading the same videos a lot 
len ratingthree With the last update I lost many documents I ve had for a long time 
len ratingthree Some I haven t edited or amended in a while but I still wanted to keep them 
len ratingone I HATE using Google Drive 
len ratingone I have my resume on here and I m just trying to attach it to an email it s not working out well for me 
len ratingone Also I tried saving said resume to a flash drive from Google Drive also didn t work out 
len ratingone It is probably user error but I find it difficult to do the simplest of tasks using Google Drive 
len ratingthree I use Google drawings a lot and it is not accessible 
len ratingthree I wish it would be all the google apps in one like the computer version 
len ratingone I feel like it has synced to everything which I never wanted and is really inconvenient 
len ratingthree It does not always pick up my scanned documents and store them 
len ratingone It s been a few days yet Gmail or google drive companies are not caring for the problem of images don t showing on the messages at a certain hour 
len ratingone That meaning If I want to see the images and a fully operational account I now check my e mail and Google drive when the other people are sleeping so at ungodly hours with no chance of yours servers being too busy to cooperate correctly 
len ratingone That means Google corporation must fix this issue of over using your services that you are UNABLE to deliver the optimal conditions at checking my e mail and google drive with no issues which is unacceptable and a shame because there are people paying for having more storage on your platforms and this is how you treat your customers 
len ratingfive Wonderful
len ratingtwo Google drive used to be the best but now I can t play any videos I upload on there except on mobile please fix that 
len ratingtwo I ve gone to forums and YouTube for help but nothing seems to help
len ratingfive I love this app so much it can help me with my school work 
len ratingfive Best ever
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingfive Greatest app for sharing any kinda stuff I m an adjunct professor and I give my current students access to review materials from class Especially good for long audio and video files from classes 
len ratingfive Out of sight from the s
len ratingfive The best to save accessible files photos and documents 
len ratingfive Always easily accessible and smooth 
len ratingfive I love this app I can complete my essays and long blog posts easy to use and very simple 
len ratingfive No glitches and I use it nearly every day 
len ratingone uhm u sucl
len ratingthree I d like to know what is preventing this app from having the technology of downloading more than one image at a time to my phone 
len ratingtwo You have to download a separate app for each type of file docs slides etc 
len ratingfive Love this app it s so awesome to store all your important work 
len ratingone  You can not open pdf
len ratingthree Great but would prefer if Google drive docs sheets photos etc required password or biometric authentication upon opening the mobile app
len ratingtwo I can t browse thru photos for seconds before the app crashes 
len ratingfive It worked 
len ratingfive Dropbox didn t so I used google drive and it did 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingone I cannot select or Back up all my iPhone photos to drive in one option 
len ratingone Gotta select each photo 
len ratingone Really 
len ratingone This app is not useful at all 
len ratingone It doesn t download all the pictures and takes a long time to try to upload 
len ratingone This is a disappointment 
len ratingone Don t bother using it 
len ratingfive I ve wry chosen to call it The Awesome Triangle because it is super practical 
len ratingfive What better way to access your documents anywhere anytime at the user s desire 
len ratingfive And it is so very user friendly 
len ratingfive Use it 
len ratingfive You ll definitely like it 
len ratingfive David
len ratingtwo It is capable of storing various kinds of files but the main problem with this app is that if a larger file such as MP was uploaded from a computer into your account downloading it to offline mode would sometimes cause the file to take a painfully long amount of time to download 
len ratingtwo I just had this problem with a minute MP file take about a good minutes to download and sometimes they take much less time to download 
len ratingfour Please bring dark mode to ios
len ratingfive I can watch all my favorite movies 
len ratingfive Thank you for creating this game Love Alexia Warris
len ratingone I don t know but in my iPhone this app is slow 
len ratingone THIS UPDATE IS STUPID I CANT DOWNLOAD MY CC FOR SIMS TO MY FREAKING IPHONE SCREW THIS 
len ratingtwo I can t find the edit doc button 
len ratingfive I love this app now tomorrow and forever 
len ratingfive This is a good place to store information 
len ratingtwo It seems like it is nearly impossible to use with an iPhone 
len ratingtwo If for some reason you have your phone screen unlocked and it were to rotate of the document magically becomes invisible 
len ratingtwo I figured this would be slightly more efficient than strapping the note to the ole pigeon but I m beginning to rethink that 
len ratingfive Great app for storing important docs
len ratingfive J hhbhhhhhhu site
len ratingtwo Very difficult to save photos from a shared album into your photo album in the iPhone 
len ratingtwo There is no download all or way to select and download selected 
len ratingtwo You have to save by 
len ratingtwo Then saving stops working after a few pictures and it won t even tell you the save failed 
len ratingtwo so you have to close the app and reopen the shared folder every few pictures 
len ratingtwo Pretty terrible user experience in that regard especially from a company like Google 
len ratingfive It s the very best to work wit it is the utmost Thank you
len ratingfive The best photo and file storage
len ratingfive Works perfectly
len ratingfive For many years I have run a successful real estate team in South Orange County California and it would be an understatement to say that Google Drive has played an integral part in that success 
len ratingfive This platform has helped us create collaborate organize and move the needle In our business from from desktop to iOS with on the spot changes that collaborate with other people shared on particular files as well as threads regarding specific questions or comments on Google Docs Sheets etc literally everything that is stored within our Google Drive 
len ratingfive It has revolutionized our workflow 
len ratingfive It s the best if I were you I would download it now
len ratingfive Exelente aaplicacion
len ratingone Why won t you allow me to empty the drive don t want to buy more storage I simply want to delete the items I no longer need which will also unlock my acct that seems to be blocked 
len ratingone And no one will reply or respond to my call or online help requests
len ratingfive Use it all the time 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfour Works well and a great collaboration service 
len ratingfive Me and my friends are starting a tiny little company to help the ocean 
len ratingfive We are young th graders so we can t make this super fancy website 
len ratingfive So we used Google 
len ratingfive It had everything we needed and we could make our website private so the whole world won t see it 
len ratingfive I think it is great and efficient to have it on my IPAD 
len ratingfive Now when I am on a road trip I can work on my stuff in the backseat 
len ratingfive Get this if you need it
len ratingone Just look at top
len ratingone Video upload very slow 
len ratingone It s very disgusting 
len ratingone  It s illegal to fire employees for discussing wanting a union 
len ratingone Let them organize 
len ratingfive Even have on my iPhone hat iOS system LOVE MY GOOGLE teamgoogle forlife
len ratingone Integrates fine with itself and other Google products but doesn t play nice with iPhone native features 
len ratingone I get that it s part of Google s platform but I m still disappointed 
len ratingone Stop discouraging your employees to unionize 
len ratingone Stop firing employees for speaking about unions 
len ratingone Offloaded all your apps 
len ratingtwo No streaming
len ratingfive So this app is amazing 
len ratingfive I used it especially when I was in my school musical and I needed the dance videos and the music to practice 
len ratingfive I just think it is a little slow sometimes but other than that I love this app and suggest it 
len ratingfour I use GDrive for work and and personal use tho mostly work 
len ratingfour I like how relatively easy it is to use but do have a few issues 
len ratingfour Printing from the drive is a pain as the file usually has to be downloaded first 
len ratingfour I cannot share an entire folder in a drive only individual files so sharing with clients is a pain when I have multiple files for them that I update each year 
len ratingfour Other than those two items I really like using the drive tho I do wish you had the option to remove yourself from a drive rather than rely on the admin to do so 
len ratingfour Sorry for any typos as I write this review the text is white on a white background so I m unable to proofread 
len ratingtwo  Keeps crashing like crazy when trying to look at photo albums 
len ratingtwo The photos are pretty large at mb each but for comparison I don t have this problem with the OneDrive app 
len ratingfour I use Drive as my file manager between the different machines 
len ratingfour I will admit though that I probably use five percent of its capacity and will invest some serious learning and apprenticeship time 
len ratingone I
len ratingthree It s super hard to find anything I ve saved
len ratingone Llllooovvee this app but it s getting very frustrating with how much it crashes on my phone 
len ratingone I can t even open a file anymore 
len ratingone It crashes as soon as I click on a file 
len ratingone Somebody please help me
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive Thx 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingone Crashes immediately
len ratingfive Reviewing uploads from excellent
len ratingone Dirtbags 
len ratingone Also make it easier to move pictures and erase them 
len ratingone Google is trash
len ratingfive Me encanta guardar mis fotos porque no se me pierden gracias
len ratingfive Keep it all in place here
len ratingone Should allow easier access to other accounts 
len ratingone Once authentication has been established stop asking for authentication again and again 
len ratingfive This is amazing 
len ratingfive I can sort of text my friends
len ratingone Very unhappy 
len ratingfive It s easy and cool
len ratingfive Win I am at school I love do it Avery bay that is how I lead how to spell and now I can spell pentagon so thank you however billy it
len ratingfive Es muy vers til maravilloso Gracias 
len ratingtwo the app keeps crashing while i m trying to save photos 
len ratingfive Keeps all my stuff in one place
len ratingfive i am really thankful for 
len ratingfive your service keep moving forward
len ratingfour This app is cool but I don t know really how to work it
len ratingfive Love Drive 
len ratingfive All your important paperwork in one place and easy to retrieve your stuff 
len ratingfour The new layout spreads things out too far it uses the iPad s huge screen really ineffectively compared to the old layout 
len ratingfive  Take off work
len ratingfour Why don t I find a delete option 
len ratingfive Always have been the best to hold everything and save it for life
len ratingfive Google drive is very helpful because I m a young kid and I don t have a phone plan so I can t text android phones but with google drive I can text people with android phones 
len ratingfive Google drive is also nice because I can upload photos from my iPhone to my Cromebook which I thought was nice 
len ratingfive B
len ratingfive Works well
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingfive I love being able to easily upload items from my phone to my Google drive from my phone 
len ratingfive It s very convenient 
len ratingfive I love that you can make little fun stories and my teacher Mr McNeil always has us do it and I love it
len ratingone It doesn t work well 
len ratingone Even now as I m typing I can t see the letters 
len ratingfive Best app there is
len ratingfive Is googling good
len ratingfive Google Drive is the best way to make slides 
len ratingtwo Search drive dose not always find my file
len ratingone Won t sync 
len ratingone Very frustrated 
len ratingfive Love it for using my data on multiple computers and always backed up 
len ratingfour  Love the app would give stars if they brought back the passcode lock to the app 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive Great for essays 
len ratingfive I love that I can navigate easily 
len ratingfive I think that it is extremely easy to organize 
len ratingfive You can also share documents easily 
len ratingfive I has changed my life 
len ratingfive I m able to print documents for work and home right from my phone 
len ratingone  We need to be able to edit our files on Drive 
len ratingone It is dumb that I have to download another app for it 
len ratingfive Very good 
len ratingfive  Feliz por mi Password
len ratingfive Excellent I love it
len ratingfive Guardo todos mis documento
len ratingfour Make pink theme 
len ratingfour Would be so cute please 
len ratingfour I ll do stars then hehe 
len ratingfour Wish it adapted to dark theme
len ratingfour Great app but just wish that this app can make me edit google slides without buying the actual app 
len ratingfour It s important 
len ratingfive  I m not saying I don t like it but I m saying I only got it for school I m in a chorus program so I need it so I m not giving it bad review 
len ratingfive Better than iCloud Drive
len ratingone Iphone can t save video to photos for posting online 
len ratingone Copy and save video do nothing once video exports 
len ratingfive Works like a charm can even share live 
len ratingfive This is an amazing platform 
len ratingfive I am happy with it 
len ratingfive Offers me portability and an amazing peace of mind 
len ratingfive I can access my files anytime and that helps me to be more productive and efficient 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingtwo  It works but only get stars until the lazy developers provide a more articulate description of what the updates entail beyond blah blah non specific always the same fixes to improve UX BS 
len ratingfive  I love Google drive
len ratingfive This is a very useful app 
len ratingfive I really enjoy this app 
len ratingfive It makes it easy to have your files on multiple devices like an online jump drive 
len ratingfive Google we the Peeps want U to make sure the great digital technological innovation DTI Google Drive continues to be a safe reliable trustworthy cloud storage space 
len ratingfive I love my G Drive think it is well worth my subscription fee

len ratingthree Add audiobook playback 
len ratingthree If I rip a CD I can play the files easily using the audio player app on Android 
len ratingthree Make it easy to get around Apple using your apps 
len ratingthree Android is good for features and Apple is good for reliability 
len ratingthree Combine 
len ratingtwo se demora mucho para descargar las im genes
len ratingfive  Very stable always there when you need it wherever you are
len ratingone I have wasted too much time trying to figure out how to put a pdf lesson plan on slides so I can edit it weekly for school 
len ratingone My co worker set one up for another class so I know it can be done 
len ratingone This should not be this tough 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive This is a very good multi platform application which I use for all of my school work 
len ratingfive I can work well remotely from anywhere and catch up on my essays and other school work 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingone Shared folders and files in google drive is a mess 
len ratingone Can never find the file you are looking for when needed 
len ratingone Would be nice if there was a more transparent folder structure and ability to see who shared what with you maybe a list on the side pane of items that you can sort as from who what when etc 
len ratingone also the share path file name convention could use some tweaking
len ratingfive L
len ratingone Login but nothing loads 
len ratingone Forced app to log out and now I can t even sign in 
len ratingthree This is a good app but not being able to type is getting annoying
len ratingfive You sound like my tech teacher
len ratingone  Simply crashes on launch on iPadOS 
len ratingone Apple products are not C friendly 
len ratingone Dear Google Please contact Apple so their mobile devices may someday soon compete on a business level with all P C s 
len ratingone As now I am seeking from a builders view who s only tools are ones I have provided for myself on from this Mobile Device iPhone 
len ratingthree So i have been tryin to upload image files but gifs and pngs do not upload on the app and just say error issues or cause the app to crash 
len ratingthree Thag is the biggest issue i have with the app overall 
len ratingfive  Wonderful and easy to use
len ratingfive Excelente la aplicaci n f cil de usar 
len ratingfive I m retired but when I worked I was the guy colleagues came to with questions about MS Word 
len ratingfive I wrote books on Word of which were technical with graphs charts tables amp statistical formula with all those Greek symbols 
len ratingfive I admired Word for years 
len ratingfive But a problem with Word for me was portability before leaving for or from work I had always to copy files from the home or work computer to a jump drive and many were the times I had to travel back to home from work or from work to home to get a file I didn t think I d need 
len ratingfive Google Docs amp Google Sheets brought all that to an end 
len ratingfive I was in Portugal last month amp opened several Google Docs amp Sheets in a flash 
len ratingfive Docs is not quite as sophisticated as Word amp I am especially unhappy when working on a painfully stupid PC keyboard with Docs arduous process of inserting special characters e g as in saut ed amp for and for degrees but Docs ready access from Chrome makes it terrific 
len ratingfive Can t imagine my day without it 
len ratingtwo I want to create a google doc or slide without downloading separate apps
len ratingtwo The uploading process is a bit longer then need be 
len ratingtwo And then it just stops and started over 
len ratingfive  Looks like a good app I just got to work it learn it 
len ratingone Doesn t support arw files
len ratingfive The app is very helpful
len ratingfive Extremely user friendly 
len ratingone Drive stores duplicate document by same name by default bad design
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive This helped me so much on school work keep up the good work
len ratingtwo Can t access all folders 
len ratingtwo Only those files that I accessed off my computer 
len ratingfive It was fun making movies and pictures selfies
len ratingfour Fine app
len ratingfive It is a very good app to use on the go 
len ratingfive If you need to study for tests or finish writing something you can do it on the go 
len ratingfive Helps me keep all my files in synch
len ratingone The app doesn t let me choose the location before saving the file from what s app 
len ratingfive I m all in
len ratingone That moment when you have a script due tomorrow and you want to insert images on the document but google drive doesn t think you have those images so you have to go on your phone to insert images but the google drive won t update so you have to let google know to fix their issues I m tired
len ratingfive It s not beaster soooo shaydn
len ratingfive Amzong app forschool
len ratingone It s not downloading stuff and it s being slow
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingfive Very bueno
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfour How do I SIGN OUT 
len ratingtwo All my uploads stop part way through the upload process 
len ratingtwo I trust this data to be transferred when directed and it s not happening 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating 
len ratingfive This app is cool
len ratingfive Great place to store my documents and photos 
len ratingfive Thanks this helps me with school
len ratingfive I use this app to study everything is able to be organized and neat 
len ratingfive Things load very quickly 
len ratingfive They can be saved 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate 
len ratingfour  it s really annoying that you can t upload files in the background you can only continue uploading while your in the Google Drive app and it still doesn t even do it when your phone is on sleep 
len ratingfour and sometimes it randomly has to retry for no reason and you should let us share multiple files with people at once instead of doing them individually
len ratingfour Google Drive is the only app I know that helps you with making Slides and Projects 
len ratingfour It is very helpful especially if you are a kid who goes to STA Bangkok they normally make you go in groups to make so many projects 
len ratingfour This is the best app I have and it makes me succeed at school 
len ratingfour If you are going to download this app I suggest you do 
len ratingfour Considering for a High school student who hates making projects and working in groups this app ROCKS 
len ratingfour Not full stars you can t say it s perfect like Heaven 
len ratingfive I continue to enjoy Google Drive for ease of use reliability and convenience
len ratingfive Nxnnxndnfnnfbd
len ratingone Leave me alone
len ratingone Doesn t allow you to attach a pdf and makes you go through google drive
len ratingone MP files will play on pc but won t play in the app
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfive This app works great on my phone 
len ratingfive Doing a few things mobily helps a ton 
len ratingthree This app is insanely helpful for me 
len ratingthree Whether it s used for school projects having a resum on hand to email as needed or to send files for my band I use Google Drive 
len ratingthree The problem is that it s still not intuitive 
len ratingthree To send a voice memo through your phone into Google Drive along with many other files that aren t pictures it can be a dizzying and near impossible task 
len ratingthree Saving documents and attachments on a mobile phone is still awkward and in most cases not possible 
len ratingthree We ll get there For now it s a good app but as phones begin to work closer to computers in terms of file sorting and saving this will be a must have 
len ratingfive Very nice to have
len ratingtwo It seems like there is always an issue with I send finished photography and videography work to customers 
len ratingtwo I m always hearing the video photos are also losing quality 
len ratingtwo Second when you send files to customers it s always difficult for them to download the photos and videos and when they do they lose quality 
len ratingtwo It shouldn t be this hard it can be made a lot simpler 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone It s acting up and won t let me open documents
len ratingtwo Drive needs to be more user friendly offline 
len ratingtwo Even my saved docs don t open offline but in this day age I should be able to access all my docs easily on or offline 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive I suggest only one thing 
len ratingfive Let us put one picture on top of another and put videos on docs and slide
len ratingfour When I rate something a five star that means nothing else out there can top it 
len ratingfour Hands Down
len ratingfour As a student and education it s necessary to have comments and pdf mark ups as a norm or easy add on but drive and docs are awesome
len ratingtwo Now it s a really hassle to organize photos in google drive because now I have to back up my photos manually to google drive and then apple ipad doesn t sync to google drive 
len ratingthree As title 
len ratingfive I would be lost without my google drive 
len ratingthree It have been happen for long in iOS files app 
len ratingthree I can t move copy any file to google drive 
len ratingthree Even use the google drive app and try to move file from other source to google drive it just fault 
len ratingthree Please fix it ASAP 
len ratingthree  One feature long missing is the ability to download multiple photos from a folder 
len ratingthree This ability exists and functions well on Android but not iPhone 
len ratingthree After so many years of this app on iPhone is this ever going to be a standard feature 
len ratingthree Also the ability to share folders with collaboration is frustrating 
len ratingthree On the desktop web version I use Google Drive for my photography business 
len ratingthree I m not always able to access my laptop and often use my iPhone or iPad to upload images for sharing to clients 
len ratingthree I m unable to enable edit sharing for anyone 
len ratingthree Clients often have to wait until I can activate it with my laptop which can be a long wait 
len ratingone Help 
len ratingone For some reason I can t download photos to my camera roll 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Screens do not close even if the X appears which is hardly ever 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingthree The login screen to authenticate google drive becomes blank once you copy the Authenticator code and try to switch to the webpage to sign in to google drive account 
len ratingthree I tried on mobile using safari browser 
len ratingthree you can t do everything in this app 
len ratingthree u have to download the docs and drive to work on ur google form for everything 
len ratingtwo Gmail Google drive doesn t work with Apple files 
len ratingtwo Super irritating to have to move things between apps to use gmail 
len ratingfive Just what I needed to access important files on the fly 
len ratingfour When I log in there is nothing to clear 
len ratingfour No clue why 
len ratingfour It doesn t work for iOS but you can make available offline Otherwise it s great
len ratingfive Efficiency at its best 
len ratingfive No need to purchase documents platforms to develop team products and reports 
len ratingfive Great way to store email attachments 
len ratingfive A great way to access your company info 
len ratingfive The greatest thing since PB Jelly 
len ratingtwo It s been a while since I ve used an apple product and would usually access my files well but I believe it s been a few years for document scanning to be a thing already especially with the new iPhone out but even so still iOS is unable to do document scan like Android 
len ratingtwo Everything was at easy reach until it comes up to document scanning 
len ratingtwo It s useful for students but it seems Android run that world And the notification of a file being successfully uploaded should be either moved or have an option to dismiss it
len ratingfive I can access on on my devises
len ratingone My photos load crystal clear 
len ratingone When finished loading they are beyond pixelated 
len ratingfive It is good 
len ratingone Confusing 
len ratingfive I love to use google drive
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone  i have tried downloading this app and logging in but none of my documents are showing up and it won t let me upload anything either 
len ratingfive It helps with every thing
len ratingfive I m nervous unsure but so far I was able to open and print an important document 
len ratingthree When I need info in a hurry it takes a long time to load only the firsts few numbers come up quickly 
len ratingthree So It s just ok could be better 
len ratingone This used to be way better and actually worked 
len ratingone Now it s full of nonsense that doesn t help but confuses everything 
len ratingfive Cumple con todas las funciones que necesito
len ratingthree  the file organization system is acceptable but could be improved 
len ratingthree the desktop backup sync app needs more work to make it sync to iOS iPadOS properly every time 
len ratingthree it feels like google cornered the market and now is complacent in building the drive based google suite up to higher functionality 
len ratingthree or alternatively that engineers are being told to do design work never a good idea 
len ratingthree iOS has been out for a while so you re behind on integrating dark mode 
len ratingthree it would also be nice to close full screen images in drive by swiping down rather than tapping the X at the top that might just be on iPadOS 
len ratingthree be better google 
len ratingthree stop trying to outdo facebook at corporate evil 
len ratingthree you used to have a motto about that 
len ratingfive Nice graphics
len ratingthree When printing it cuts off the document
len ratingfive Well this app is amazing but they really need to add Somali Iknow many that know somali and so do I 
len ratingfive I speak it every day and just could you add it overall it s perfect 
len ratingfive Good jobs developers
len ratingfive i have been a loyal user of google drive since forever and it s never failed me once 
len ratingfive if your looking for any free online storage this is it 
len ratingfive don t kid yourself with other stuff 
len ratingfive like come on 
len ratingfour  Google Suite including Drive is a great free productivity bundle 
len ratingfour Highly recommended 
len ratingfive Makes my life easier as a contractor great way to track progress and keep the customer informed 
len ratingone Very difficult to move files within google drive 
len ratingfive I use GD for everything from school to teaching and family purposes 
len ratingfive Please add an safety lock for photos and folders so no one can see them beside me 
len ratingfive PDF files won t open 
len ratingone Why does Google want to share information about me 
len ratingone There is no why to continue to sign into Google Drive without allowing Google to share information about me 
len ratingone No thank you 
len ratingone It s not saving any videos that i ve sent to myself in the google drive 
len ratingone It says failed everytime and it s the only reason i need the app 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive Working remotely has been so much better with the drive 
len ratingfive GOOGLEDRIVE
len ratingfive Good and cool
len ratingfive Does everything I need it tooDoes everything
len ratingone Is this better if done on a computer 
len ratingone I m frustrated with the process 
len ratingthree  Google drive just uploads very slowly now and whenever I upload something it s not even a video and it takes a long time 
len ratingthree I even check back after at least an hour or thirty minutes and it s still slow 
len ratingthree Please fix this and then I will give you a review 
len ratingthree I don t like my time wasted and I don t like how slow it is at all and it hasn t been doing this until the iOS update 
len ratingthree Please look into this thank you and have a great day 
len ratingfive I m glad photos don t merge to Google Photos anymore 
len ratingfive Not all photos are what they seem on the surface 
len ratingfive This is helpful and kind of creepy too 
len ratingfive We ll see what comes of it 
len ratingfive Maybe there will be less chaos for my crossword puzzle history project now 
len ratingone Not user friendly or clear where items are located nor how to access them on iphone 
len ratingtwo Not very user friendly and no easy way to save videos and photos to iPhone
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone It now keeps you logged into your google account on safari 
len ratingone If you clear history and cookies you then have to log back into all of your google apps 
len ratingone Never was an issue until this terrible iOS release 
len ratingone If you haven t updated 
len ratingone Don t do it

len ratingthree Also when I try to save the video to the photos app it doesn t 
len ratingthree Not sure what s going on with this new update but it definitely didn t make things better 
len ratingthree The other version was much more stable imho 
len ratingone I ve tried to look at a set of photos my photographer sent me 
len ratingone I have get to go past viewing before the app crashes 
len ratingone One minute you re viewing it and the next it just exits the app and you re back at square one 
len ratingone Beyond frustrating use the online version and you might have better luck 
len ratingone Probably part of the plan to make us pay for storage space 
len ratingthree Come on Google 
len ratingthree Get on the band wagon 
len ratingthree Your app is so bright I have to wear shades 
len ratingthree Let s go here 
len ratingone Yep

len ratingfive I ve never lost a document during the many years I ve had Google Drive and I still have the files I made when I was eight years old 
len ratingfive I appreciate how documents can be edited and viewed across multiple devices 
len ratingfive It is easy to create various types of documents slideshows forms etc 
len ratingfive Teachers can share notes with students and control view comment suggest edit settings 
len ratingfive The many organization and sharing collaboration features are very helpful and so is the offline editing setting 
len ratingfive My school district made an account for every one of its students and I think it has contributed to our success 
len ratingone  Takes way too long to process videos 
len ratingone I Suspect it is a marketing gimmick to get you to buy Google Drive Pro 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingfive Saves your hard drive space on your computer and phone 
len ratingfive Convenient and free 
len ratingfive No need to pay for drop box 
len ratingfive Works the same way 
len ratingfive Excelente

len ratingfive Makes learning a lot easier and more fun 
len ratingone Trash
len ratingfive Love the format
len ratingfive My Google Drive is a Great way to share information and keep everything organized in one place 
len ratingfive Google drive is perfect for all my needs 
len ratingfive On a professional level all of my documents can be created 
len ratingfive On a personal level Google drive is perfect for all of my basic needs 
len ratingfive I have not used Microsoft for many years because Google offers everything I needs for free 
len ratingone Not sure where save my documents
len ratingone I don t want to send a link 
len ratingtwo It s hard to work with folders to locate stuff in mobile view isolated files are shown with no way to find their enclosing folder

len ratingfive Pray to continue the effort thanks Brian 
len ratingfive Best cloud storage and file sharing app available

len ratingone I have to constantly request access and then it never allows me

len ratingone Asking me to rate it
len ratingone Where did all my folders go 
len ratingone I can t find an of my files 
len ratingfive You can keep all of your papers organized and your slideshows and docs It is really helpful for school and creating any documents power points and slideshows 
len ratingfive Excelente App
len ratingthree This is a message for developers It does the job and I use it everyday every hour but I personally think it s still a BIG MESS if you also constantly use DOCS SHEETS SLIDES Etc in an iPad and different types of files in different folders 
len ratingthree I use Docs Slides and Sheets and organize my files depending on their projects so all these different types of files are in different folders that s why they exist no 
len ratingthree BUT the fact that the folders are in DRIVE while the actual files are in their separate apps it s just a big mess 
len ratingthree Every time I open a file from my Drive it takes me to its separate file app aka Docs or any other and then when I hit back wanting to go back to the original folder I m actually going back to all the DOCS list of files because I m in that app not in Drive anymore 
len ratingthree Even with having the folder icon that shows you the folders in the Drive the folders only show the type of files of the app you are using 
len ratingthree  Meaning if I have a folder with a sheet file and a doc file if I go to the doc file and want to see the sheet file when I hit the folder icon the sheet file doesn t show up because I m in the Docs app so I have to go to the Sheets app 
len ratingthree That s not user friendly at all I have so many type of files for different projects folders because of my work and I bet a lot of people do 
len ratingthree I hope developers read my message 
len ratingthree Can t DRIVE come with DOCS SHEETS ETC already in the same Drive app 
len ratingthree Just like when you are using a laptop 
len ratingthree Does it really need to have it all separate 
len ratingthree Making us have to go back and forth between apps and folders and files 
len ratingfive Awesome ease of retrieval
len ratingfive I love it because is accessible everyone you are 
len ratingfive Hasn t let me down for about years now 
len ratingone How do I trash the one thing in here 
len ratingone I have no idea how it got in 
len ratingone Guess I ll just delete the app 
len ratingfive hi
len ratingthree Other than the app crashing almost every minutes whenever I try to download pictures from I iPhone or iPad with the app this app is amazing 
len ratingthree I ve tried deleting re download the app as well as restarting my iPad iPhone no matter what I do it always crashes 
len ratingthree Other than that I really enjoy this app but if something could be done about the app crashing on tablets phones that would make this an even more amazing product
len ratingfive It s really great to be able to instantly view any documents I need on my phone when I need them 
len ratingfive I use it for work college and for personal backup 
len ratingfive I d like to collaborate with others more exclusively on Drive 
len ratingfive I ve even convinced my wife it s a great resource to support her record keeping homeschooling our kids that she now regularly uses 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Look up In The Hole on Apple Music
len ratingfive I keep all files on drive for access across platforms
len ratingfive This tool is very useful and is totally free 
len ratingfive Storing files and google docs has never been easier and having all this data at my finger tips feels like this would have been impossible a decade ago 
len ratingfive The future is now and I will continue to use this for the foreseen future
len ratingone I m trying to watch a movie but it keeps saying unsupported file
len ratingone google Drive has been working great for the longest time 
len ratingone But now it updated I can t open my files 
len ratingone Amazing how companies have to justify change by making things worse
len ratingfive  I love it I can turn all of my work in anywhere 
len ratingfive This is one T this is what it I find Google Troy
len ratingfive  this app is easy to navigate and very useful
len ratingfive Very useful for any project you have 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive No problems easy to use 
len ratingfive I can t stand apple but a few Google apps keep me going 
len ratingfive Works quickly easy to navigate 
len ratingfour  when will the dark mode arrive thnx
len ratingone When viewing short mp videos I m viewing via the app I am unable to close them after opening 
len ratingone The x does nothing 
len ratingone Have to restart the app 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingfive Love that I can use it anywhere 
len ratingone Unless your using it as a open share platform anything you view documents video pictures will always display on your home screen even if it s hidden in your folders or on someone else s drive
len ratingfive Thank You
len ratingfive This app is the best thing to happen to me 
len ratingfive I have every important doc in my disposal accessible at any given time 
len ratingfive Wounderfull to store personal details
len ratingfive I love how I can make so many doc edit send all on the fly from my phone 
len ratingfive T t
len ratingfive The most useful thing ever 
len ratingfive I list cooking receipts on Google drive that our son can access and prepare familiar dinners while away at collage 
len ratingfive He can eat very well and has not gained the dreaded freshman from fast food 
len ratingfive Thanks for the app 
len ratingthree Double speed missing
len ratingfive Good software for free
len ratingone There is no way to browse other saved offline tracks while one is playing you must exit the song first before selecting another 
len ratingone In addition you aren t able to skip back and forward audio tracks while the phone is on the lock screen 
len ratingone Google drive definitely needs an update on this aspect perhaps add a dedicated player inside google drive for audio files 
len ratingfive On google drive
len ratingfive Storage for the more age 
len ratingone I don t like this
len ratingfive It is a tool that makes life easy to store my files and pull them up always one click away to a place for info to stay 
len ratingfive Helena
len ratingfive It works so well 
len ratingfive Hi downloaded it on my phone and it was a bit harder but I managed 
len ratingfive I love this app it helps me to obtain my lectures easily
len ratingone I wait for a long time for my files to show up 
len ratingone Then everytime I try to access larger files they stall out 
len ratingone No access 
len ratingone  Currently files have to be selected individually and made offline 
len ratingone Why can t folders be kept offline 
len ratingone This is utterly stupid 
len ratingone I was forced to upload my documents on Google drive when I sent to Gmail message to an associate 
len ratingone The items now take way too long to load 
len ratingone Stupid application 
len ratingfive a life and time saver I wonder if there s a difference 
len ratingtwo  To difficult to get my files 
len ratingfive ya
len ratingfive Life saver
len ratingthree Please 
len ratingone I have to login And log out several times to see my updated files
len ratingone This app chooses when it wants to work or have errors for simple things like uploading 
len ratingone I m going back to Dropbox
len ratingfive I want to be able to hide certain videos and pictures
len ratingfive Yur yurr
len ratingthree For some reason Google Drive doesn t allow me to edit my docs or slides or anything 
len ratingthree Not sure if it s my phone that s causing the problems or if it s the app 
len ratingthree Otherwise great app but don t know what happened 
len ratingfive Review Optional 
len ratingone Completely terrible and unreliable in every conceivable way 
len ratingone Without the forced google integration I couldn t see how anyone with an ounce of sense would opt to use this app 
len ratingone Everything from its security measures to aesthetics is ridiculous and unnecessarily 
len ratingone It fails at every attempt at efficiency 
len ratingone Frustrating 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingone So many better options out there 
len ratingone You d think a company like Google would create something better out of the sheer shame of this result 
len ratingfive I am eternally grateful to have the ability to use this product to structure my successful and growing business thru GDrive 
len ratingfive Thank you kindly tj
len ratingthree Drive is really the best vs Dropbox or OneDrive but the Video is still processing problem is ridiculous 
len ratingthree Some get processed immediately as other apps do but some never get it done 
len ratingthree Yes you can still download them but you don t know what you re looking at until downloaded 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingone This is very difficult to use 
len ratingone I don t have time to get permission every time I want to open something 
len ratingone Hate this 
len ratingfive I can get to my drive from my phone my laptop or my iPad even off line if I set it up that way the search capabilities are great and I can easily share with anyone 
len ratingfive The more I learn the more I love it 
len ratingfive It s replaced our Microsoft Office 
len ratingfive Wonderful experience the documents keeps on with absolute precision 
len ratingfour Suggestions Dark Mode like Android Drive 
len ratingfour Please GDrive Renamer Bulk Renamed Folder Copy Option Google Drive Media Player to play a larger variety Without that many of us have to authorize and give access to our content to a strangers Apps Script Developers to be able to use essential methods such as a media player or a bulk renamer or other apps or scripts that are essential 
len ratingfour I know there other options but requires knowledge to do the script ourselves 
len ratingfour At least give us the Dark UI option 
len ratingfive  I hope I succeed in my reviews 
len ratingfive It s amazing for YouTube and just in general 
len ratingfive  Amazing Perfect Awesome Helpful Easy Wonderful I love it 
len ratingfour  cool just takes up a lot of storage but whatever 
len ratingfour It s easy to manage too
len ratingfive Yee
len ratingfive  Is good to have slides
len ratingfive Helpful
len ratingfive  It is personally enjoyed to have access to my documents from anywhere 
len ratingfive Get a lot done with this
len ratingone Lol I don t know when this update rolled out or why did they rolled out if you are on iphone and have google drive on it neither you can download the documents to icloud nor it doesn t let you download or upload an document to gmail apart from iCloud 
len ratingone Very frustrating for being member of google drive
len ratingtwo Not uploading to renamed folder
len ratingone Thumbs down
len ratingone  Not good
len ratingtwo You watch a shared video and you touch the screen and the sound dissapear 
len ratingtwo  then you touch it again and it ahows you a cross in the corner to close file and only on the third time you see a bar for video forwarding and time well its not a hat expected
len ratingfive Save all your keep sake s and documents with ease
len ratingone Their food was well meh
len ratingfive Amazing way of keep all your file organized and ready to used from any device 
len ratingfive I recomend Drive for back up and work with your Files from any place 
len ratingfive Thank very mush 
len ratingone Freezes frequently when trying to switch between docs
len ratingthree I ve used this app to store photos for a long time but the other day i saved about photos and somehow they all disappeared and no longer there 
len ratingthree not in the trash or in a random folder 
len ratingthree it just says they re pending but i can t save them again or even view them 
len ratingthree they re still there and it s been like two weeks since i tried to save those 
len ratingthree i m so so so so sad 
len ratingthree they were photos of my newborn nephew my passed away dad and the dog that ran away are all gone 
len ratingone This app is dumb because I can NOT finish my school project or ANYTHING 
len ratingfive  Super good great app hopefully I ll get all my stuff documents photo s ect good organized and save
len ratingone Such a stupid feature
len ratingfive Love thi
len ratingfive Great for school
len ratingfive  Okay I ll have to admit it THIS APP IS THE BEST 
len ratingfive I m in an acting show where the vocals and songs were used on this app and it plays really well 
len ratingfive It never pauses randomly like other apps 
len ratingfive We originally had to use Facebook manually to navigate our way to the vocals but with this app I have to do steps 
len ratingfive Click what file 
len ratingfive Go to Facebook 
len ratingfive Go to the secret group 
len ratingfive Find the tracks 
len ratingfive  you should know the rest 
len ratingfive If I would have to delete this app I would rage and BREAK every device I own 
len ratingfive Summary This app is really helpful for saving documents unlike Google Docs where you actually have to wait a while for it to save and if you don t you have to type it all again 
len ratingfive This app also loves you saving files vocals songs ANYTHING 
len ratingfive There might be problems with songs not loading but I guess that depends on you re internet strength 
len ratingfive I hope you rate this a star like I did 
len ratingtwo When I downloaded it I assumed you could edit files 
len ratingtwo You can t 
len ratingtwo You have to download google docs etc 
len ratingfour Kind of unclear to navigate sometimes 
len ratingone  I ve tried to look at a set of photos my photographer sent me 
len ratingone I have get to go past viewing before the app crashes 
len ratingone One minute you re viewing it and the next it just exits the app and you re back at square one 
len ratingone Beyond frustrating use the online version and you might have better luck 
len ratingfour The ability to password protect documents 
len ratingfour Otherwise love the product

len ratingfive Google Drive is easy and convenient from anywhere and on any device 
len ratingfive Very helpful 
len ratingfive My docs are still visible and was not erase 
len ratingfive Thanks to google 
len ratingfive Google drive is so useful when I have files to view anywhere 
len ratingone Cannot open a google doc straight from google drive and can t seem to preview it 
len ratingone How is that a usable tool 
len ratingone It used to work just fine and no idea when that changed 
len ratingone Glad I use Dropbox for just about everything else 
len ratingfive So user friendly and accessible 
len ratingfive Replace my iPhone and Ipad storage 
len ratingfive Have much more room now 
len ratingfive The once a yr data plan should be TB at a cheaper price so I wont need to buy iTunes every month 
len ratingfive Otherwise it s wonderful 
len ratingfive Needs lock screen feature 
len ratingfive Please add 
len ratingfive Love google drive 
len ratingfive I like the fact that files are automatically saved and that you can access them from any device and also they can be shared 
len ratingfive We use Google docs to keep our book club meetings organized 
len ratingfive Changes are easily made for the meeting locations book selections and wine food ppl book club is often called wine club 
len ratingfive It helps keep my documents with me wherever I go 
len ratingfive Impressed by the quality of G Drive 
len ratingfive Helpful trustworthy and extremely convenient when accessing different computers but using the same files accessing files while travel using mobile devices also 
len ratingfive Only suggestion is more user friendly G stream download 
len ratingthree In Dropbox when you copy a document a bar will come up and it lets you select a folder and rename the document 
len ratingthree Then when you use google drive it doesn t work 
len ratingthree Poor on mobile but it works in a computer 
len ratingfive  Thank you for being the best free service out there 
len ratingfive I m loving your greatest job 
len ratingfive I m appreciate so much 
len ratingfive loverlimeno
len ratingone Im unable to download multiple files or even one file in a simple way

len ratingone months and no dark mode google baad
len ratingfive I would highly recommend using Google Drive for home or business 
len ratingfive It s a fast and easy way to create organize and share documents

len ratingone Will you ever fix this 
len ratingone It s not on Microsoft s side

len ratingone You can open a word file from files drive and edit and close and it auto saves but you can t create a new file and save into google drive from word or excel 
len ratingone Sigh 
len ratingtwo This is a nice app and I appreciate the utility of it 
len ratingtwo However unless I have perfect reception the load time for a PDF in my drive is egregious 
len ratingtwo It takes less time for me to log into the website via safari and select then load the item that way 
len ratingtwo I would consider this an app to be used at home under optimal conditions rather than an on the go app 
len ratingtwo I will probably uninstall from my phone soon and simply use the web version if I really need to view something 
len ratingfive  Absolutely amazing 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and great for schoolwork 
len ratingfive It saves your documents and files which is great if you want to review them 
len ratingfive  would recommend 
len ratingfive Better than iPhone files folder
len ratingfive So convenient to have a mobile app 
len ratingfive I have had it for years 
len ratingfive  ABH
len ratingfive Very efficient and reliable app keep it up
len ratingone Super slow 
len ratingone Takes forever for pictures and videos to upload or view 
len ratingone I wish this drive was organized more like Dropbox 
len ratingone I don t like that I don t have the option to title and place in or create folders while I save 
len ratingone It seems you have to go back in the drive to do this each time you save an item 
len ratingone Very time consuming and too tedious not user friendly 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive i love google drive because convenience
len ratingfive I Love It 
len ratingone  I can t access my Google Drawings and I can t edit them 
len ratingtwo Its okay
len ratingone I uploaded a csv file to Google Drive using this app and they then won t let me open that csv in Google Sheets 
len ratingone I have to go to Safari to do that 
len ratingfive Dumb app
len ratingone  It
len ratingfour It works well 
len ratingfour I didn t get to use it long enough to give it a star but it keeps popping up to review it and I accidentally hit it 
len ratingfour So it s a star so far 
len ratingfour It might go up or down in stars as time goes by 
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingfive I like the app cus u get to du this year for a day and a half and then I have to go get to the snow day off tomorrow and I can go to the car tomorrow morning and I have a couple more work

len ratingfive Very easy to save photos or documents and it s super easy to retrieve them even for someone that is not as computer savvy as most people now a days 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive Been using it for years 
len ratingfive Can t do without it 
len ratingfive great app
len ratingfive Even as an iOS user I will always love google drive 
len ratingfive Even though iCloud Drive is just about as good especially with the family plan iCloud cause I sort of have to on iOS 
len ratingfive Wish there was more free storage like Mega but still Google Drive all the way 
len ratingfive Google drive has defined my way of learning on an iPad and makes it so easy to share my homework and reports 
len ratingfive If you ever want to go paperless for school I recomend google drive 
len ratingfive It is amazing and it keeps the files so organized
len ratingfive Google drive helped me a lot like now I upload videos about Fortnite on Instagram and it helped me get followers
len ratingfive Love the flexibility
len ratingfour Hi can you guys add iOS dark mode support please 
len ratingfour It would really help with late night works 
len ratingfour Thank you guys
len ratingone I don t like it
len ratingfive Yeeeeeeeeeee
len ratingthree i m annoyed because whenever i m playing an audio and i turn my phone off then i pause it on the lock screen it doesn t pause 
len ratingthree so then i click it again and it rewinds to a random part way before 
len ratingthree ITS SO ANNOYING
len ratingtwo I generate about small video clips during hockey games which I subsequently upload to Drive 
len ratingtwo If I select all of them for upload Drive fails to upload any I guess there is some unknown max per single upload 
len ratingtwo So I upload at a time but Google doesn t mark the pick for files already uploaded 
len ratingtwo I therefore have to try and guess which files are not yet uploaded it s painful trying to guess where the cutoff is 
len ratingtwo Each thumbnail looks to similar to distinguish by the image each one depicts some guys playing hockey 
len ratingtwo This would be easy to fix uploaded files have filenames show the filenames in the pick list 
len ratingtwo Or mark whether a file has been uploaded in the pick list 
len ratingtwo Or even allow us to view the metadata of a file on demand within the pick list 
len ratingtwo Any of theses would make the job easier 
len ratingtwo As it is I m working on an upload of files 
len ratingtwo Can t figure out the last upload so I have to delete the or so I did and start from scratch 
len ratingfive Very very grateful it s amazing AnnabelAdvisoryBoard
len ratingone Unable to export google drive video to you tube
len ratingone  Same as title
len ratingfour It provides basic features with a simple interface 
len ratingfour The biggest drawback is your can t play multiple songs in a row without interacting 
len ratingfour It would be nice if you could play all the songs in a folder 
len ratingfour Even better would be if you could define a playlist 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone I wish this was easy to use 
len ratingone Because it isn t I barely use it I wish that I could 
len ratingfive Epic 
len ratingtwo  It s been two whole iOS releases since the Files app was introduced and Google still hasn t fixed their buggy implementation 
len ratingtwo It doesn t show the correct number of items in folders doesn t show items in the correct order and doesn t load thumbnails until you open an item and let it download 
len ratingtwo Multiple people have confirmed this is an issue with how Google implemented the API for Files integration since OneDrive and Dropbox both do not have these problems 
len ratingtwo Google Drive is a great service I just wish Google would spend a bit more time cleaning up their apps for it 
len ratingfour Kazi
len ratingfive Wow it keeps everything very safe 
len ratingfive This app offers a very responsive version of Google Drive that feels nearly identical to the website 
len ratingfive Uploads from my app are reflected on other devices within minutes and I consistently enjoy the experience of using this 
len ratingfive So helpful to access files on my phone
len ratingfive Nice storage capacity and nicely integrated with the rest of google s services 
len ratingfive Everything I need is at my fingertips 
len ratingfive It is so easy to go to google docs to google sheets and to google slides it is really helpful when I need to make a presentation too
len ratingone Can t delete all files 
len ratingone Whenever I try to insert a picture from my camera it always says NO CAMERA SELECTED 
len ratingone Check your camera s connection and ensure your camera is not already in use by another application How do I do any of this when there is no website to help me 
len ratingone If I log out and try again nothing happens 
len ratingfive Great place to turn to for extra space lol don t charge me please
len ratingfive Do your homework everywhere with this amazing app 
len ratingtwo There is a bug where some files keep on processing 
len ratingtwo Some files process for months on end and never stop 
len ratingfour Overall great app 
len ratingfour However alternative document sharing other than Gmail or links to Drive could be available 
len ratingfour I would love to have the option of easily sharing the real document through other apps such as Whatsapp or whatever 
len ratingfour Printing documents through the IPhone Drive app is always a pain 
len ratingfour Whenever I try it I always give up and end on printing documents through the laptop s web browser which works but is inconvenient 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive  I love the Drive 
len ratingfive Easy to work with 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and it s interaction with other Google applications is amazing 
len ratingfour What a help and convenience 
len ratingfive Rashid was very knowledgeable and entertaining 
len ratingfive And a great driver as well 
len ratingfive It s great I really have no complaints
len ratingfive Really simple and fun I love to write articles about animals and biographies about others 
len ratingfive The best upload in the world 
len ratingfive So So good I love the easy to access files along with the fact that I don t have to go onto a computer to access it 
len ratingone I am not able to find how to sign off
len ratingfive Outstanding use this all the time
len ratingfive I mean nothing compares to google drive 
len ratingfive It is something that I rely on daily 
len ratingtwo  I thought I just save the document to the drive here and I can t find it 
len ratingtwo Apparently I need to learn the system better because I m having difficulty deciphering where documents and pictures are being stored 
len ratingtwo Google is the hardest to get back into a recovery email isn t even enough to log you back in 
len ratingtwo I swear I have accounts and my phone number is saved but i will never receive a text receiving my password 
len ratingtwo Oh and forget about your previous password Google you re a troll 
len ratingone  I w e No
len ratingthree We regularly have difficulties sharing files with people outside of our organization 
len ratingthree Google is generally not user friendly particularly with respect to gdrive file sharing 
len ratingone Unfortunately Drive s integration with Files app is unusable 
len ratingone For example the contents of folders are regularly replaced with an error message Content Unavailable 
len ratingone The folder contents could not be displayed because to an unknown error 
len ratingone As another example I cannot reliably copy a folder from a non Drive source to a folder on Drive 
len ratingone Google please be a good citizen on iOS iPadOS and fix Drive s integration with Files app 
len ratingone Simple as it says basic important functions are either hidden or difficult to use 
len ratingfive I think that drive helps me organize and put many things together making it very useful and efficient 
len ratingfive I can always find things I need and everything is right there 
len ratingfive Thanks for a wonderful experience 
len ratingfive CUse it several hours a day for writing and organizing
len ratingone Does not open documents in native apps and such it s useless
len ratingfour Google drive is nice only issue with it is managing and moving items from folder to folder 
len ratingfour Window is always too small and not easy to copy items from folder to folder within the drive
len ratingone So dumb 
len ratingone I have to download all the apps to edit whereas on a computer I could just edit on google drive 
len ratingthree Could not open or download the Videos Pictures properly or fast 
len ratingfive Absolutely love Drive 
len ratingfive It easy to use and send video 
len ratingfive I m not very technical 
len ratingfive This app is easy well organized 
len ratingfive I tried msft solution and it was painfully slow 
len ratingfive I ve uploaded s of photos and they upload at a relatively fast pace 
len ratingfive Love being able to share the pics with others 
len ratingfive Love it fun and fresh
len ratingone This is the dumbest feature 
len ratingone I m busy and so are the people who are requesting permission to download something they were obviously supposed to receive 
len ratingone It s super annoying and how to just have it downloadable like old style attached images isn t clear if the option is available 
len ratingone Google fail 
len ratingfive This is so cool because you can do your assignments on here and you can do your homework
len ratingtwo When my notifications appear in red and I enter they don t disappear 
len ratingtwo That s very frustrating 
len ratingfive LOVE IT 
len ratingfour I gave it stars because I was asked within seconds of opening the app for the first time for a review 
len ratingone The feature with the Google Photos Drive function has affected the way I do business 
len ratingone Please bring this feature back 
len ratingfive Best app for my coworkers and myself to share things and be able to get tasks done together 
len ratingfive Perfect app for the hospitality industry 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive Muchas gracias me gusta el programa por qu puedo almacenar mucha informaci n gracias
len ratingone This is so awesome 
len ratingone Thank you for an update that just broke something that was already working 
len ratingone That s so awesome 
len ratingone HOW DO I MOVE PHOTOS TO GOOGLE PHOTOS FROM GOOGLE DRIVE 
len ratingfive Awesome skills
len ratingone Google is ruining my experience with google 
len ratingone The apps on the iPad are awful 
len ratingone I use this app on an ipad and i can never seem to get it working right 
len ratingone There is so many things that are hard and complicated to do 
len ratingone I get tired of getting messages from the recipient that they can t get to the images 
len ratingone Make it clear how to allow access before I send the images out 
len ratingfive I use it for my class work 
len ratingfour This is a great app 
len ratingfour My computer broke so I downloaded this app to access my google drive 
len ratingfour Success 
len ratingfour I was able to get on my drive and see all of my documents 
len ratingfour I was really happy that I could do this on my iPad 
len ratingfour One day I wanted to edit a google doc so I got onto the app 
len ratingfour I clicked on the doc and in the bottom right corner there was a pencil indicating you could write 
len ratingfour I clicked on it and it said I had to download the docs app to write 
len ratingfour What a rip off 
len ratingfour To make google slides you have to download the slides app 
len ratingfour To make google drawing you have to download the drawings app 
len ratingfour You have to download three different apps to do anything of your google account 
len ratingfour So stupid 
len ratingfour This is a terrible app so please don t get it 
len ratingfour It is really good but nothing is perfect 
len ratingfive  OMG such a life saver 
len ratingone Google why 
len ratingone Can you just stop changing things around 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive  Very gut niceu
len ratingone I really dislike all google products
len ratingone How do I reset own
len ratingfive It s cool
len ratingfive I recommend the Google drive to everyone and anyone 
len ratingfive It is so versatile 
len ratingfive I found it Stream Lee useful when I was handling an estate and needed documents repeatedly 
len ratingfive Whether I was dealing with insurance companies and banks or lawyers all I had to do was tap on a file I had scanned and stored on the drive and I easily emailed it over to them while sitting in front of them 
len ratingfive I have told others to scan anything and everything they can to be able to access it when needed 
len ratingfive I also love doing crafts and keep patterns on the drive 
len ratingfive Rather than carrying around papers that can easily be misplaced I pull up a pattern on my phone or tablet to zoom in an see things clearly and easily 
len ratingfive Naturally it works great for my work files 
len ratingfive I can update files without being in front of my laptop 
len ratingfive I can back up all of my files and know that they are safe 
len ratingfive A difficult question would be why wouldn t you use Google drive 
len ratingone Y
len ratingfour I recently switched to an iPhone for the first time after being a Galaxy user 
len ratingfour The Google Drive app is just as smooth for iPhone as it was for Android but it has one shortcoming that would make it a star for me the app will not scan PDFs directly into Google Drive 
len ratingfour The Android app allows the camera to scan a document as a PDF with no additional app required 
len ratingfour The iOS Drive app only allows you to scan image files using the camera 
len ratingfour I ve got to use a separate app to scan a document as a PDF then share it into Google Drive 
len ratingfour That isn t terrible but adds a step that the Android app doesn t require 
len ratingfour Add that feature to the iOS Drive app and it would be perfect 
len ratingfive Wonderful memories
len ratingone Every few minutes it crashes while I m perusing my photos 
len ratingone I m being forced to use the browser version 
len ratingone It s useless if unusable 
len ratingfive Google Drive has helped so much throughout and still helps with school 
len ratingfive It keeps me organized and always keeps me on task 
len ratingfive  Can t get enough of this update 
len ratingfive I can save documents and create new ones right on my phone 
len ratingfive So convenient 
len ratingfive  I wuv google dwive
len ratingthree Many time Google drive crashes or just would not let me attach the file to an email 
len ratingthree The desktop app I have to reinstall it daily just to get it to update 
len ratingthree The trash bin fills up and it will not auto delete and it takes up my storage space 
len ratingthree I have to go to the website to manually delete them to clear up space It s annoying with the many little bugs but the pro out way the cons 
len ratingthree I can have as many devices as I wish connected to one account as I like unlike Dropbox which limits you to unless you pay an ungodly price for a small amount more 
len ratingthree Google drive charges a small price for a huge amount of space which I will be upgrading he very soon 
len ratingfive ROBLOX STUDIO FOR MOBILE DDDDDDD
len ratingfive It s kinda lit 
len ratingfive The is a neat look location to house information that you can even forget you have 
len ratingfive Taking your favorite videos and photos can be stored easily and without any hiccups and shared across so many operating systems 
len ratingfive Clouds come and go sometimes they rain 
len ratingfive Head over to Google Drive and let the sunshine in 
len ratingfive Everything is sooo simple and quick 
len ratingfive I love it and the the storage feels like it s infinity 
len ratingfive And I love how I can access it anywhere as long as I have access to the internet 
len ratingfive Makes completing assignments easy 
len ratingfive Yep
len ratingone  It s almost and I can t download multiple files from google drive on my iPad cause google is stupid
len ratingfive I love this app it helps me stay for school organized
len ratingfive  years ago is around the time I started to blossom as a adult and leave from the nest of my mother and make my own decisions and seven years later I can say google drive is one of the best decisions I ve made as an adult 
len ratingfive It s out lasted my battle with Android and apple and my battle with Twitter and Facebook and is without a doubt better then any other company product company out their and I am a proud apple iPhone holder but with out my google drive I wouldn t even hold the memory s from my long journey with iPhone 
len ratingfive Guys at google continue being amazing 
len ratingfive Our year friendship has withstood a lot of crazy journeys and you have been their for it all 
len ratingfive Never losing a memory and noticing the important ones 
len ratingfive Yay love this ahahah best thing ever lol
len ratingfive When your laptop can crash at anytime it s reassuring to know that Google is storing your documents 
len ratingfive It is incredibly beneficial to be able to review documents on many different devices 
len ratingfive Enough said 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a must have tool for students businesses and personal use 
len ratingfour  Gh
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive Google drive is a great tool for my small business to cost effectively store and share documents with clients staff and vendors 
len ratingfive Able to find old photos 
len ratingtwo I see several complaints about files not showing on Google Drive 
len ratingtwo I experience the same 
len ratingtwo Also files take a very long time to upload no matter how fast is my internet connection 
len ratingtwo I hope to see improvements 
len ratingfive I use this app to save all my pictures 
len ratingfive I don t enjoy the cloud and google is a great tool for me 
len ratingfive I like that it s hooked to my email that I use for everything and it s so easy to upload important documents 
len ratingfive I also like the facts that you can share documents with others 
len ratingone Since it doesn t show photos permissions I can t use to backup my photos
len ratingfive My phone completely die this drive saved all my documents related to a law suit 
len ratingfive I love it Saved all my videos evidence 
len ratingfive I love this app it s so easy to use
len ratingfive My office started to use G Dr about a year ago 
len ratingfive We love it because it ties many office functions and Communications together 
len ratingfive I can look and review documents from any device at any location 
len ratingfive We also can make update On different documents and share them with other colleagues in the company and even other vendors who we are doing work with 
len ratingfive I look forward to even using GDrive this more in depth 
len ratingfive Love It 
len ratingfive  It saves your work as you type so if your power goes off it will save it will save it
len ratingfive ZZSoRwC sessswzss mmssure tas yr
len ratingfive This app is very useful
len ratingfive  e
len ratingone There s no real instructions as to how to use this app 
len ratingone That doesn t seem user friendly at all 
len ratingtwo With the latest upgrade the size of the picture preview was made smaller 
len ratingtwo It s too small 
len ratingtwo You have to click on each picture to know what the picture is 
len ratingtwo Previously the preview of it would be large enough to know 
len ratingtwo I no longer can use the app when I m trying to find a particular picture 
len ratingtwo I have to use the website 
len ratingtwo Please revert back to the previous size for previewing the pictures 
len ratingone Keeps crashing when I open the file
len ratingfive Love this app it helps me with all of my files and documental needs 
len ratingfive Such a great and easy way to share your work on multiple platforms and to share with other colleagues or coworkers as well 
len ratingfive  would reccomend 
len ratingfive Considering upgrading to terabytes
len ratingfive Awesome Tool 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive It works very smoothly and I love it 
len ratingfive I love being able to access photos and videos 
len ratingfive bobs boobs
len ratingfive I recommend using google drive 
len ratingfive Whether you re a teacher a student an employee etc 
len ratingfive this app will work for you 
len ratingfive It is so simple and functions amazingly 
len ratingfive Definitely give it a try 
len ratingfive A lot of my work is done on my mobile devices so having google to be able to actually create on an iPad and then upload via my laptop is is the most clutch system 
len ratingone I have this app and whenever I download anything even if it supports the file type it says This app does not support the file type so i rage whenever it takes hours to download something and it says this 
len ratingone I wish I could rate no stars 
len ratingfive Very useful and resourceful I just love it
len ratingone Ruined my video files
len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingfive Nice to use
len ratingone Every time I try to open a file the entire app just closes down and I get a black screen 
len ratingone Wish I could open files on this app 
len ratingone Doesn t work currently even after all current updates 
len ratingthree It would be so much better if you could make corrections or add to lists 
len ratingone On my ipad and iPhone X drive always abruptly shuts down and closes entirely after I rotate through a dozen or so images 
len ratingone Makes it hard for me to view and show off photos and a SUPER weird glitch 
len ratingone Tried screen recording it happening and the videos never save 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX 
len ratingtwo I m not sure why the download feature is available when it doesn t work 
len ratingtwo Anytime i try to download ANYTHING it will spend minutes exporting and will just cancel out instead of actually downloading what i need to download 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating 
len ratingthree I couldn t send via gmail iPad wouldn t let me via share 
len ratingthree I sent as an attachment on gmail 
len ratingthree Drive is fine apple is interfering 
len ratingthree Need iPad to Facebook with grandkids
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone You can not edit anything on here
len ratingone Wish it was easier to search for content 
len ratingfive It s amazing 
len ratingfive Easy to use and very practical 
len ratingone Very hard to open do not how it work junk Make it simple for people please
len ratingfive Food
len ratingfive I love the system overall it CAN helps children and teachers organize very well 
len ratingfive However two negatives maybe I m missing 
len ratingfive I don t see how where parents can easily privately get in touch with teachers if need be 
len ratingfive Or if that s an option each school class or teacher turns off and on individually 
len ratingfive I find it hard to navigate 
len ratingfive In my school district they give the kids chrome books which are great but JUST using the track pad makes some projects extremely frustrating as the chrome book itself doesn t have great range with the track pad and understandably so don t get me wrong for its price range the Chrome Book is an amazing machine 
len ratingfive However in my school district they don t offer nor do they even SUGGEST the children to go get a cheap USB mouse which I would HIGHLY recommend yes you can learn all the commands fairly quickly but like I said there are certain precision moves in slides for example which would be much better off with a mouse unless a better strategy was built into the system 
len ratingfive This review is kind of going off on a tangent a bit as I ve diverged from the initial topic Google Classroom 
len ratingfive I feel also that if things aren t kept under control it could potentially get very disorganized and confusing for some kids 
len ratingfive For example If they re like mine using the same Chrome Book from th th grade and then a newer one come high school all their older material remains in the system for all four years making it a little mind boggling to sift through 
len ratingfive I found myself deleting tons of old work just to start from a clean slate in th grade NJs middle school 
len ratingfive If there were an easier way again perhaps there is but I m not aware of to go in and delete any work previous to a certain date that would be helpful 
len ratingfive They must do that when they go back and pass this back to the new fourth graders after the current th graders graduate 
len ratingfive Honestly now that I think about it I think my problem is more evidently with my school district and not at all with Google Classroom which when used properly is a gem of a learning tool 
len ratingfive I grew up in the MS DOS WINDOWS You ve Got Mail AOL weird beeping sounds for an hour era but I was drawn to computers early on given private tutoring lessons eventually went to school took some classes in programming and various software of interest that I wanted to master 
len ratingfive Computers have been the backbone of my education I was the first generation to have handed in a thesis printed out off a printer from a computer 
len ratingfive Yet despite all that I disagree with this ALL INCLUSIVE idea that computers are now seen as THE ONLY WAY we learn 
len ratingfive I feel my daughter is at a disadvantage without a teacher standing at the front of the room or walking around lecturing but returning to the board to write notes for us to take down and soak in 
len ratingfive Developing notation style was a huge component to MY learning experience I even wrote notes and read real PAPER books on how to use COMPUTERS LOL 
len ratingfive  and I know I m not the only one out there who learns from taking notes 
len ratingfive I think maybe taking notes by typing is okay 
len ratingfive To a degree and in certainly shrinks our carbon footprint but does it 
len ratingfive We re still using electricity to power up these technological advances 
len ratingfive But I still really do believe in the power of Classroom which unfortunately cannot be ENTIRELY replaced by computers at least it shouldn t 
len ratingfive When we loose humanity even in our classrooms we re starting to walk a thin line 
len ratingfive I believe Google Classroom sets a precedent and SHOULD be used for some things especially when introducing our older students to learn our to use computers 
len ratingfive Let s be real however a most of these kids are more technologically savvy than we are b a more balanced approach in anything we do as human beings is always the right answer 
len ratingfive Just ask any computer algorithm 
len ratingfive Great Functionality Perhaps add a dark night mode
len ratingone slows down the workflow also the thumbnails are too large for efficient at a glance
len ratingone I use Google drive and don t have a lot of data and when I go to share the drive it takes several minutes to perform the share feature which is ridiculous 
len ratingone I have a proximately people sharing and it s an absolute pain every time to add remove somebody 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT THANK YOU
len ratingfive All I have to say that it is Amazing 
len ratingfive Great business tool 
len ratingfive These people at Google have it all figured out 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this to anyone 
len ratingfive Outstanding and very good value 
len ratingfive Excellent application 
len ratingfive As a teacher I use it to save my class work and materials 
len ratingtwo Couldn t edit MS Word docx document
len ratingfour Yag
len ratingone Too slow
len ratingfive I can upload content from anywhere and access it from my computer or mobile devices 
len ratingfive Google drive keeps my business at my fingertips 
len ratingtwo Vbbn que
len ratingfive L
len ratingone This is difficult to navigate and the and another account feature doesn t work 
len ratingone I would prefer Google to do their own QA rather than depending on us to do it 
len ratingfive Go away
len ratingfive  Awaome 
len ratingfive Counsept seems good
len ratingone You upload a bunch of pics and videos and it crashes
len ratingfour i love this app and it is amazing but sometimes i ll be trying to load a video and it gets stuck on video still in process for days even weeks 
len ratingfour please fix this then it would be five stars 
len ratingone This app is bad don t get it please 
len ratingfive Very convenient 
len ratingfive I love this drive in the sky I can work on projects on any computer anywhere 
len ratingfive Write on my iPad on at the airport waiting for a plane and open it on Mac Pro when I get home 
len ratingfive Great way to work 
len ratingone I have no understanding how Drive works 
len ratingone Can I obtain an overview 
len ratingone Also a more complete explanation 
len ratingone There is no way I can upload my resume 
len ratingone Not user friendly at all 
len ratingfive Great app and service but Please add pdf text reflow feature Thanks
len ratingfive Is a great have extra space to keep safe your files but you need patience because the most of the time is slow to find or save something
len ratingfive Best thing ever 
len ratingfive Couldn t live without it
len ratingone Nuni 
len ratingfive GR APP 
len ratingfive Way easier than other platforms and my school used google drive so I grew up w it
len ratingfive Easy to using
len ratingfive I m going to heaven
len ratingfour It s good enough to do day to day activity 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive I love saving my files and videos on this app 
len ratingfive Excellent Drive 
len ratingfive Keep Up The Good Work 
len ratingfive It is so easy to use 
len ratingfive Either on my phone or at my desk it s that easy
len ratingfive Mis documentos est n seguros y en un solo lugar
len ratingone The app worked a grand total of times 
len ratingone After that it crashed every time I tried to open it regardless of how many times i force quit 
len ratingfive Lol I luv drive 
len ratingfive It is a good plce to type docs 
len ratingone Keeps crashing when I try to view my photos
len ratingone The quality of the programs they are doing recently is horrible 
len ratingone Doesn t back up all your important data like it should 
len ratingone Don t give these screwups your money 
len ratingone They couldn t program themselves out of a paper bag now a days 
len ratingone This was running in the background for hours despite me never opening the app itself the only thing I can think of is if when sharing something it causes it to run in the background because it s an option regardless this is truly a drain on battery and should be fixed
len ratingone There are no examples on how to set up budget spreadsheet
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingone I can go on the app and open a file but as soon as I click on something in the designated file the screen is black 
len ratingone This has been happening for awhile and I ve had iPhone s plus and now currently XR 
len ratingone I have better luck on my MacBook on the actual website than my phone iPad 
len ratingone  Open app go to share sit there for minutes before being able to type or copy the name to share 
len ratingone Ridiculous 
len ratingone Had multiple photos go missing randomly 
len ratingone Very disappointed and unsatisfied 
len ratingone Not acceptable 
len ratingfive I m and my LAUSD school uses google drive 
len ratingfive We do drawing and writing on this app it s amazing 
len ratingfive The people who can get this are so LUCKY 
len ratingthree  Allow creating zip files from mobile phone 
len ratingthree Works well for general use it should improve with simple additional functionality such as creating a folder in the drive then uploading files into that folder 
len ratingfive This app is soooo could u
len ratingone Not loading my work 
len ratingtwo I m not sure if it s because I m a photographer viewing large files but I m only able to view about at a time before the app crashes
len ratingfour Please allow us to show search result in icon view rather than the default list view 
len ratingfour Icon view makes files easier and quicker to recognize at first glance without having to read each individual file name 
len ratingfour Google drive is an amazing app when you need it for school 
len ratingfour I love this app and everyone who needs to look at something on there drive or forgot to finish something you can just get out your phone and download google drive and finish whatever you are doing 
len ratingfour Who ever made google drive you are a genius 
len ratingthree Easy to use for sharing pictures however encrypted MS Word docs can be opened on MacBook and iPad but not iPhone

len ratingone Can t pull files up quickly
len ratingthree I lost all my data in the past due to google erasing it
len ratingfour I have daily limited use of Google drive but it does what I need without too much fuss and only an occasional quirk 
len ratingfive If true I m given this app a without having tested attempted

len ratingfive I recommend you get google drive the best part is it s free 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Best app ever 
len ratingfive  This is one of the must have tools out there for almost everyone in my opinion 
len ratingfive The ability to quickly upload download save documents and photos as well as view offline among countless other capabilities is a near essential for many and is most certainly helpful for almost anyone 
len ratingfive I ve used Drive across several devices between Android and iOS platforms for just shy of a decade it seems 
len ratingfive While there are bugs at times the current setup seems to run flawlessly 
len ratingtwo Title
len ratingtwo How to open zip files in the drive from iPhone

len ratingthree When saving photos or email attachments unable to navigate to team drive folders 
len ratingthree Very annoying 
len ratingthree Otherwise good app 
len ratingthree Pls fix navigation issues 
len ratingtwo Complete pain to get videos from the Drive on my iPhone so I can upload them to Instagram 
len ratingtwo There should be less hassle and errors trying to get the video on my phone 
len ratingtwo I ve tried numerous methods to reset and restore the app however I can t get a MB video on my phone with gb free 
len ratingfour Very helpful app 
len ratingfour Stores information very well and easily accessible across different devices 
len ratingfour A must have app 
len ratingfive  It s real good I love it
len ratingone Bring pass code protection back
len ratingfive Great service I love that everything is right there from all of my devices 
len ratingfive I use it and not my Apple Cloud

len ratingfive Great for the whole family 
len ratingone Drive is not much worthy one the reason is all images are not uploading
len ratingfive  Help me out to give my stuff back
len ratingfive awesome 
len ratingone Whining at users and effectively forcing reviews is childish and antisocial 
len ratingone I m not sure why and the error message I receive provides no useful information but of late I am unable to save PDFs to my Google drive 
len ratingone This is really irksome 
len ratingfive Muy buena muy til 
len ratingtwo  Video is still processing weeks later

len ratingfive  Great app to use for school and helps me when I forget I need to do homework so I can do it while I get to school 
len ratingfive Great app totally recommend 
len ratingfive The best application to save anything
len ratingfive I am in love with this app 
len ratingfive I do not know how I ever did with out it 
len ratingfive I lost two hundred years of Family Photos if I had this I would not be so sad 
len ratingfive YOUR SERVICES ARE REMARKABLE LETS SET UP A DEAL
len ratingfive Pretty awesome
len ratingfive Se
len ratingfive  Google thank
len ratingfive Love being able to view my spreadsheets 
len ratingthree Some excel features can not be apply or you last some info 
len ratingthree But it is not bad 
len ratingthree Yo can be frustrated with the app some times
len ratingone Does not support eml email file previews 
len ratingone And has issues providing correct authorizations 
len ratingone You expect better from a paid service but now I see why things like deopbox and other cloud services exist 
len ratingone Get it together google geeze 
len ratingone Too confusing
len ratingthree Google apps on iOS seem to always work with quirks 
len ratingthree For instance I can take my work in the car with me in the passenger s seat DON T TEXT AND DRIVE KIDS 
len ratingthree I can also send the same email to PEOPLE over TEN TIMES because the EMAIL BOX doesn t DISAPPEAR when you SEND EMAIL FROM THE TEAM DRIVE 
len ratingthree But it s still better than Dropbox 
len ratingone Why can t you remove recents without deleting the whole file 
len ratingone I want them hidden so when I open the app everyone can t see those files 
len ratingone It s a privacy issue 
len ratingone I downloaded an important government map and tried to open it but it was all mixed up text 
len ratingone No option to change format 
len ratingfour Google Drive is an EXCELLENT resource 
len ratingfour The fact that it converts documents from their original form into its own proprietary format can make it difficult to access them from the Drive use them in their true format 
len ratingfour  Example most MSOffice documents This is likely due to inter platform licensing but it makes it more cumbersome than just saving to a simple Cloud storage 
len ratingfive I can easily access my folders and my documents with just a tap 
len ratingfive It s really easy to use 
len ratingone Difficult to navigate 
len ratingone Thanks

len ratingone It was never the same since 
len ratingfive As a songwriter sending music files via email takes too long and isn t safe 
len ratingfive This is the way to go 
len ratingtwo This seriously takes forever to upload 
len ratingtwo I get that it s free storage but days to upload a video is ridiculous 
len ratingtwo And it s still not even halfway through 
len ratingtwo I was able to Airdrop the same video in less than a minute 
len ratingtwo I m hoping this is some kind of bug to fix or something but it gives a horrible impression 
len ratingfive I use this app for PDF books I purchase online 
len ratingfive I use it Assignments and Documents I work on

len ratingfive I can share everything with families and friends 
len ratingfive so convenient for business and storing your entire computer on your phone

len ratingfive I have been a very longtime user of google and I have to say from onset I knew that Google was going to do really well and I should of got on the boat early On and made a really nice investment keep up the good work 
len ratingfive Good I guess
len ratingone All my photos are in landscape 
len ratingone They should be in portrait 
len ratingfive This app is so great 
len ratingfive I can carry all my doc all at once So amazing 
len ratingfive  It s great for school if you have an iPad for school and or a computer instead of having to take your iPad or computer with you where ever you go you can just take your phone 
len ratingfive Totally recommend 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingtwo I can open an individual image and save it to my camera roll but I can t select multiple pictures or pictures and videos and do the same 
len ratingtwo Please add that ability 
len ratingfive Love it makes it easy to transfer to my files to my pc 
len ratingfive  Gucci
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive  I use this daily and if there is something I didn t turn in I can do it on the go 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive I still think there should be a repeat option for audio files 
len ratingthree Hackers penetrated it and created havoc
len ratingfive  It awesome for school use 
len ratingfive It keeps everything organized for me 
len ratingfour I love the Google Drive everything I need is easily accessible and the storage is great for my iPad or iPhone 
len ratingfive Its kinda weird that they have the IPhone X in their image when viewing the app in the App Store Overall thought I love all the apps google has made it makes school so much easier and make my life so much more organized 
len ratingfive It is very interesting that you can share your thoughts and ideas with friends
len ratingone I can save file in google drive 
len ratingone Garbage weak App
len ratingfive This app really helps me when I get lazy to take out my laptop while I could just easily pull out my phone and do it in here 
len ratingfive Also it saves automatically corrects grammar and lets you be very creative with your slides 
len ratingthree Google drive s thumbnails are often cropped versions of a full thumbnail making it difficult for me to know what picture it is when Im looking for a specific shot 
len ratingthree I dont like this i do a lot of photography and these cropped thumbnails really get in the way slow me down 
len ratingfive This app has been invaluable in keeping all my paper documents organized 
len ratingone The Move To feature is not available when transferring a file to a specific folder 
len ratingfive This is an easy straightforward and valuable tool to all my information 
len ratingtwo App has always been great 
len ratingtwo Crashes after a few mins ever since last update 
len ratingtwo Get on it Google 
len ratingfour I really don t know why i can t get the folders size 
len ratingfive I really enjoy this app 
len ratingfive It s a great place for me to store in my pictures and work all in one place 
len ratingfive Then afterwards delete the photo on my camera roll 
len ratingfive But one thing I don t like is the lost of quality when you retrieve an image back 
len ratingfive For example when I look up an image on google with high quality resolution save it into my camera roll then go on the Drive app to save it there 
len ratingfive Then I save that photo from Drive on to my camera roll it has lost its quality 
len ratingfive I ve done the comparison already 
len ratingfive But that s just one problem I have with this app 
len ratingfive Overall it s a really great app 
len ratingfive But please can you guys do something about it 
len ratingfive Color
len ratingfive Awesome and easy to save and use 
len ratingfive Its great
len ratingone It continuously crashes 
len ratingone I have a lot of storage in there I need and it always crashes when I m in there 
len ratingone How hard is this 
len ratingone Every one app has figure this out except all the Almighty google 
len ratingone One of these days basic features will get added 
len ratingone Until then incompetence continues to pervade development of this app 
len ratingfour Google products are some of the best out there 
len ratingfour Just wish I could trust them with my personal data 
len ratingfour Ever since they gave up not being evil and began using their effective monopoly to push a political agenda I have been looking to replace their products with more fair minded competitors 
len ratingfive You know that 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingone In general I am a fan of drive 
len ratingone What I do not like about it and what may end up forcing me to quit using drive is that I cannot edit a word document on my Ipad Pro and then save it to my drive 
len ratingone I get an error every time 
len ratingone I cannot edit my documents in drives word version because of the formatting issues 
len ratingone This means that in order to save a document I have edited in word in drive I have to save it to my Ipad or Icloud and then transfer it to drive 
len ratingone This is not very efficient and has resulted in me having a ton of the same files in different locations 
len ratingone I have told Google about this problem but they have not fixed it or gotten in touch with me about the issue 
len ratingfive Everyone should have this app installed 
len ratingfive You never know when would you use it
len ratingone Trying to start up new phone and this process for Drive is ridiculous
len ratingfive Good but could use more villains and gym prep for the main character 
len ratingfive That hammer looks awfully big for him 
len ratingone Why is deleting a file not an option on document menu 
len ratingthree Kind of over it with technology you need this ap you need this storage you need this drive oops you haven t used your drive in days items will be stored somewhere in cyber space blah blah blah 
len ratingthree My kids were mistaken when they said you gotta get with it Ma and get on board with technology 
len ratingthree I ve been in a constant state of distraction and sense of being lost ever since I got with it 
len ratingthree Google drive 
len ratingthree Never can find what I thought was there half the time 
len ratingfour Had to call google help line to find out what was going on and the left me hanging on hold for a long time with no response so I had to hang up 
len ratingfive Encouraging Word
len ratingone Unpredictable what I ll find when I open it 
len ratingone Won t recognize files I want to download to it 
len ratingone Come on Google put a delete button on the drop down 
len ratingone My google drive has been updating for days and doesn t give me the option to cancel the update can u fix this it is draining my battery significantly
len ratingfive I love having the ability to get all my documents anywhere and any time 
len ratingfive Auto saving all Google docs is a great safety measure 
len ratingfour But I was not allowed to put half stars 
len ratingfour This is awful 
len ratingfour My skin feels dry 
len ratingfour And I just think it could have been a better start to the day 
len ratingfive So real it was amazing 
len ratingfive Will come back again and again 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone Why can t I download my folders 
len ratingfive All that I need in the same app
len ratingone I try using the Drive to work in multiple places across multiple devices 
len ratingone I can never rely on the stupid drive to give me access to the files or share them when I am trying to collaborate 
len ratingone I hate that it gives you different options when you work on a desk top vs an iPad vs droid 
len ratingone Can t you be consistent 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive all the time very helpful for storing files
len ratingfive I use it for work school and more 
len ratingone Gmail integration is a joke 
len ratingone File organization is a mess 
len ratingfive  Very Well I Love It
len ratingfive  S d ng ti n l i
len ratingfive  I love google drive it help me a lot with my school work I can easily catch up if I was absent it is so easy to work with I love it 
len ratingone  The priority window that the app opens up to is useless 
len ratingone I wish I could rearrange which folders appeared in which order 
len ratingone The sharing option is also very bad on iOS 
len ratingone All apps allow you to share files with other apps on the device but the drive app assumes you want to share through Drive which is of no use to me 
len ratingthree I can t transfer my photos from drive to the desktop 
len ratingthree It takes hours just to scroll through them and select at least anything 
len ratingthree I ve tried to reach my collection from different computers but to no avail the result was the same 
len ratingthree And I pay for the storage each month 
len ratingthree Though works fine with docs 
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingone So they don t allow you to download files pictures from drive to your iPad 
len ratingone What year are we in 
len ratingfive Good for school and very organize I like it a lot But there should be a sorting button And files and albums to organize
len ratingfive Love the integration and collaboration that google drive offers through docs and other software 
len ratingfive I like less that all is initially downloaded and shared in one common space 
len ratingfive I thank Google for giving us storage with all kind of documents supporting us and making us creative Goodness Google love you always
len ratingone It s pretty incredible that a company that has enough money to buy my entire town can t make an app that can open a pdf without crashing
len ratingone Not friendly at all
len ratingfive This is the most amazing way to access change and share with all business partners 
len ratingfive Convenient and Reliable 
len ratingtwo I keep trying to upload my resume to some of the job websites and for some reason I am on able to 
len ratingone The review kept pestering me so I left one like it wanted me to 
len ratingfive I got enough space to pack loads and loads of dookie into 
len ratingfive It s G R R R 
len ratingfive  realGsonly
len ratingthree  Every few minutes it crashes while I m perusing my photos 
len ratingthree I m being forced to use the browser version 
len ratingfive Easy to use well organized and works very well
len ratingfive Doodle dip
len ratingtwo Ridiculous and difficult to use
len ratingfive yeet
len ratingone Is constantly loosing all of my files 
len ratingone Definitely don t recommend 
len ratingthree It s to disorganized 
len ratingthree It s difficult to find the files I m looking for
len ratingfive Truly great program to share videos directly to one or more individuals 
len ratingfive Thank you for program 
len ratingone the app itself is fine 
len ratingone the desktop version is amazing 
len ratingone however the mobile app is horrendous and anytime i m within a shared folder full of photos it crashes 
len ratingone i need to reopen the app every time 
len ratingone i can t view my own photos at all because it constantly crashes 
len ratingone fix your app please
len ratingfive I love the drive and I can access information 
len ratingfive From any device 
len ratingfive Excellent tool for storing information
len ratingone I love the idea of having access to your files across different platforms 
len ratingone The problem is my Mac Pro iPad and iPhone are not syncing at the same time and often folders will have missing files 
len ratingone Keeps crashing on my iPad and iPhone 
len ratingone Can t use it on either
len ratingfive Way more functions options and storage than Dropbox did l mention it s also FREE
len ratingtwo It is horrible on an iPad or iPhone compared to looking in a PC 
len ratingtwo But I guess it s tolerable 
len ratingfive I recommend this app to everyone that wants to know where their files are at all times 
len ratingone I can t run google slides on an iPad 
len ratingone I ve tried things and it won t run 
len ratingone I hate this program 
len ratingone You upload photos at a time and it crashes 
len ratingone You have at most fifty if your lucky 
len ratingfive Google drive has helped me in a massive amount of ways helping me structure and organize my new business 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingtwo Delete remove the note 
len ratingtwo I couldn t remove the old notes since I no longer need them 
len ratingtwo My file looks cluttered 
len ratingfive This is fabulous 
len ratingone Can t open pdf files from iPad 
len ratingone The system just spins for a while and then Google Drive just crashes 
len ratingone Size of file and network bandwidth do not seem to make a difference 
len ratingone I really hate how it takes x as long to delet things 
len ratingone You should create an app where we can just check the things we want deleted and then delete them 
len ratingthree I have been using google drive for years 
len ratingthree It is great for everything I need and use it for however in the past several weeks when I have it open it just shuts itself down 
len ratingthree This is problematic because I then have to reopen it and relocate the file I was using 
len ratingthree Can you please work on whatever bug may be causing this closeout crash 
len ratingthree Other than that I love the app 
len ratingfive Es tremenda app y soporta bastante
len ratingfive I can now watch full episodes of Pb amp j otter 
len ratingfive OODELAY
len ratingfive Espacio ilimitado 
len ratingfive Esta brutal 
len ratingone I ve been trying to upload G for two days now 
len ratingone This is unacceptable 
len ratingone Can t figure out how to delete and arrange files in the new update 
len ratingtwo Can t you get this app an app locking option 
len ratingtwo This thing seriously needs an app lock 
len ratingtwo We might have some sensitive contents that we want to hide 
len ratingtwo An in app lock would be great for it 
len ratingfive Use it for everything
len ratingfive I have a lot of videos I need to save to a drive and this works just fine 
len ratingfive It s nice to have this apps at the same time is easy to access by phone and convenience by using 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone HATE IT 
len ratingone I ve been trying to edit a PDF from my google drive but haven t been able to even see it in my docs app 
len ratingone I know I ve edited before on my phone but now I can t 
len ratingone And to make it worse I can t even download the documents 
len ratingone Works when I don t need it to 
len ratingone Is a slow alternative to safari 
len ratingfive Easy to save files 
len ratingfive Easy to share folders with family members 
len ratingfive Recommend to everyone to get a google drive 
len ratingfive Using Google Drive has created freedom for me 
len ratingfive I use it to keep me connected to my resources from any device that I own 
len ratingfive What s even better is the opportunity to pull up items quickly and share it with others 
len ratingfive It s amazing 
len ratingfive Best app on my phone
len ratingthree Sometimes files are hard to find organize 
len ratingfive Noice
len ratingtwo This is hard to use 
len ratingtwo It took me longer than it should to find how to organize it with folders and keeps switching between apps 
len ratingtwo It can t tell when I want to open something and when I m just trying to open the menu to do something with it the three dots 
len ratingtwo It s has good storage space and I haven t accidentally deleted anything yet but it is frustrating to use at times
len ratingfive  Nice app and accurate on time
len ratingfive Ready to go great at organizing your files couldn t recommend this enough for people who work white collar jobs 
len ratingthree Only a small portion of the files I was sent made it to me to download 
len ratingthree Very disappointed and disrupted 
len ratingthree I want this app to be good for saving pictures and videos so they don t take up as much space on my phone but you can t even upload more than photos at a time or a video longer than minutes 
len ratingthree It just won t even upload the video or photos if there are too many you re trying to upload at once 
len ratingthree Another problem is I m trying to scroll through all the photos I uploaded and the app just keeps crashing while I m swiping through the photos 
len ratingthree Really annoying 
len ratingthree Needs a lot of fixing 
len ratingtwo Have a fair amount of issues with syncing 
len ratingtwo Desktop client won t search keywords always comes up No Results have to open internet browser to do keyword searches within Drive 
len ratingfive I don t know how I ever taught without using Google drive 
len ratingfive It is perfect to share files with my team principal or anyone else that needs the documents we all need in education 
len ratingfive I will never go back to attaching a document to an email when I can easily add it to our drive 
len ratingfive It is a fantastic tool to make my life a little easier 
len ratingfive Thanks for making a great tool 
len ratingthree Firstly Google Drive does a generally good job but it could be better 
len ratingthree First after you create a doc using the plus button it drops you back at home tab not the same folder where you created it 
len ratingthree Second if you go look in the folder where you just created it many times it won t appear there for a while which is confusing and frustrating as you don t know what happened 
len ratingthree Third I think because Google wants to give fast response time it will sometimes show empty folders that are definitely not empty and after some time you ll see the contents again frustrating and disconcerting 
len ratingthree What I d like to see are simple voice memo and notes options added to the plus sign 
len ratingthree It could make a great job of that especially as they retired the api that let other apps update the drive with notes docs voice memos 
len ratingfive Using Drive sure makes it convenient to get to your stuff 
len ratingfive Log in from anywhere on anything and you can get to your files 
len ratingfive  Yes Drive it s the best Only I recommended 
len ratingone Keeps crashing on iPad
len ratingone Title 
len ratingthree I use this app for both professional and personal reasons 
len ratingthree Sometimes the latest version of a document does not save accurately 
len ratingthree For example in a team project I will made changes to a document and when a team member reviewed those changes the next day they were never updated 
len ratingthree This has happened on more than one occasion 
len ratingthree If Google can remedy this with consistency I will be glad to change my review to five stars 
len ratingfive I like it
len ratingthree I wish u could edit no matter what cause you shouldn t have to download anything to edit cause now I can t finish my fantasy story 
len ratingone It s aight 
len ratingfive Great stuff
len ratingfour  I want to sort my images without the app crashing 
len ratingfive Easy access add folders 
len ratingfive I use it at home work 
len ratingtwo Google Drive is fine when I m not using the app 
len ratingtwo This app does not recognize when files have EXACTLY the same name 
len ratingtwo It will let you save or copy several files to Drive with the same name 
len ratingtwo Dumb 
len ratingfive  Good app for productivity 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone You did it at the wrong time
len ratingone Needs very good cell service due to size of files
len ratingthree  I ve been using this app for a count Leo of weeks now and it was good until it randomly stopped 
len ratingthree I would have to relaunch the app only to find minutes later it does the same thing 
len ratingone  I tried to upload many photos together and unable to do that 
len ratingone I need to upload one by one which s complicated I dunno how google develop such as poor app it s very hard to use additionally you have kept the screen on till it s upload 
len ratingfive I love this App and ability to assist in organizing communication and distribution my hard work 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingthree  I can t even order by modified or date properly 
len ratingthree  This and lack of other organizing features make it uncontrollable 
len ratingthree Simple doesn t always mean good 
len ratingthree It s limited 
len ratingthree  I ve had client files on locations suddenly revert to earlier states without warning 
len ratingthree Fortunately we had back ups 
len ratingthree I don t trust the storage at all 
len ratingthree It s just a convenience to access almost anywhere 
len ratingthree  pretty much no features to organize or manage what s local vs cloud 
len ratingthree So it feels still like beta software 
len ratingthree Since I pay for it I d expect more functionality 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingtwo I had trouble uploading any more than photos at a time to Google Drive using the app 
len ratingtwo Often the app would get of the way through a set of uploads and then get stuck processing or retrying the upload 
len ratingtwo Pretty disappointing after hand selecting each of s of photos individually 
len ratingtwo Nothing I tried would make it continue so I had to again INDIVIDUALLY cancel each photo I had been trying to upload 
len ratingtwo I updated the app 
len ratingtwo Now basic things like thumbnails take even LONGER to load the app performs slower in all respects and photo uploading immediately stops at processing and then gives up entirely 
len ratingtwo Not functional for uploading photos at all 
len ratingtwo Very disappointed 
len ratingfive Works great Thanks
len ratingfour Thanks for the message and will give the best advice to you sir Aasalamualaikum
len ratingfive It serves all my needs and is a great compliment to Google drive on PC 
len ratingfive I haven t experienced any big problems yet and I would definitely recommend Google drive on iPhone 
len ratingone When you try to share a document the screen freezes and doesn t let you type in an email 
len ratingone Otherwise I love your app 
len ratingfive  It allowed me to be able to do my homework instead of me failing
len ratingthree It is frustrating you have to download another app to edit and you can only view on this one 
len ratingfive Everything I need for writing and it saves automatically plus free 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive No Microsoft word too old school and can lose all my works 
len ratingfive If you re not fully aware that having a fully operational google drive is of the utmost importance you will 
len ratingfive Thanks for this useful software
len ratingfive  Lo M ximo
len ratingfive Covers everything I ever needed 
len ratingfive I refer to it often 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive  Everyone should use the Google programming 
len ratingfive It s the best assistant money can 
len ratingfive I love this it is realy helpful
len ratingone  Can t see a big number of images sent by photographer 
len ratingone Must i load them one by one 
len ratingone Do zipped files work 
len ratingfive I use google docs for college 
len ratingfive I save all my essays slides and homework s on here 
len ratingfive As far as my knowledge my papers stay here for ever 
len ratingthree Wish you could download multiple files without having them zipped 
len ratingone I don t know what s wrong with google drive on my iPhone it doesn t open word file and i can t change it 
len ratingone Now when you try to upload more than one file at once the entire app freezes and doesn t go beyond processing uploads 
len ratingone This is absolutely ridiculous 
len ratingone How is there an update and bug fixes yet the app still doesn t function 
len ratingone SMH 
len ratingfive I love the google drive Platform 
len ratingfive Intuitive 
len ratingfive Easy 
len ratingfive Easy to use and always works great 
len ratingfive Dose This Have million Reviews
len ratingone To slow
len ratingfive Can a walk lucky lucky lucky lucky Lolo ha ha ha ha ha ha 
len ratingfive I like the app

len ratingthree My files wont send to my account
len ratingfour Br nice have lil more free space

len ratingtwo I run a small arts organization and a very large percentage of my work takes place using Google s services 
len ratingtwo I recently replaced my laptop with an iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo I was aware that the Drive Docs Sheets etc 
len ratingtwo apps had some features missing I use them on my phone but mistakenly assumed that I could still just edit through the browser same as I did on my computer in order to access all of the features I need to run my business 
len ratingtwo I am very very disappointed that this is not the case 
len ratingtwo I am a huge fan of these services and wish that I could access them fully using my device 
len ratingtwo Google Drive is great but without the ability to access all of the features this app makes my job incredibly difficult 
len ratingtwo Please bring back the ability to edit via the browser so those of us who are moving away from bulkier laptops and desktop computers can still access your services 
len ratingfour  Apple Google
len ratingone This app is starting to get annoying 
len ratingone I can never access my files from my iPhone 
len ratingone Always says offline 
len ratingone Never allows me to go online 
len ratingone When my clients send me links 
len ratingone It always says unable to open item this item was not found or you do not have access to it even when I send the link to myself from my account on the computer to my email to open up later on my phone 
len ratingone There is no indication of the person received the link there is no notes option just say there has been updates 
len ratingone I always have to add a new contact usually mines to share it to to get a notw option 
len ratingone Just to say Hey there has been updates to the folder There is no one to call or speak to 
len ratingone No YouTube videos or information on how to get it to work on my phone 
len ratingone When it does decide to let me open my own files all of the folders aren t there 
len ratingone I literally have to do everything from my laptop

len ratingtwo Just opened google drive app for first time on my iPhone Plus 
len ratingtwo Instantly saw my files I uploaded from computer earlier after signing in on the mobile app 
len ratingtwo Problem is after I played a mov video in full view I can t go back or revert back to the main screen with all my files 
len ratingtwo I tap on the movie that ended but keeps toggling for me to tap between x and arrow to reduce the screen but stays in this viscious cycle and can t get out 
len ratingtwo Just download the latest update today 
len ratingone On the iPad trying to scroll through my drive is nearly impossible it keeps closing on me 
len ratingone Every time I select the audio files 
len ratingone It starts playing but there is no play button I cannot stop it or rewind or fast forward 
len ratingone And most importantly on the top left corner 
len ratingone I cannot close it either 
len ratingone I am blind

len ratingone Useless 
len ratingone I hate the unsupported file type stuff
len ratingfive Si
len ratingthree Can t see shared drives can t attach documents either from iOS mail or Gmail 
len ratingthree Only able to see shared drives only through the Google Drive app 
len ratingfive Drive is a lifesaver for my job as a multiple school teacher 
len ratingfive I use it for my large network of educators and I don t know how we could function without it 
len ratingtwo Video titles behind the notch 
len ratingfive When I have a document come to my inbox and I try to organize it I have to scroll to find the folder where it is 
len ratingfive It seems that there could be an easy add on to create a search bar in order to place documents into folders 
len ratingfive This is Google the inventors of search 
len ratingfive I m happy that easy and fast to open and see my documents 
len ratingfive  I can finally watch Pb and j otter offline oodelay lol
len ratingone Useless and uninstalled 
len ratingone Why must i save everything to gdrive instead of just air printing like every other software on the planet
len ratingone Can t even save documents to my phone 
len ratingone What s the point in having the app 
len ratingtwo  Since the last bug fix and update none of my pictures or videos will upload 
len ratingtwo It says processing uploads each time and does NOT upload them 
len ratingtwo Mind you I didn t have this issue before this latest update 
len ratingtwo I thought it was my connection so I reset my connection only to find out it s the app it s self since the same thing is happening to a friend of mine 
len ratingtwo Please fix this nonsense 
len ratingtwo  App has always been great 
len ratingtwo Crashes after a few mins ever since last update 
len ratingtwo Get on it Google 
len ratingthree Could you please make a multiple download option for the apple version it would be so helpful 
len ratingthree I transfer hundreds of photos from my computer to my phone through drive and saving them one by one is too time consuming 
len ratingthree There is also a bug that causes the app to crash when I try to upload more than around photos
len ratingfive Not now
len ratingfive Love google drive
len ratingone  There s no SELECT ALL opt 
len ratingone Hello 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive I love it this apps
len ratingfive Extremely powerful and easy to use 
len ratingfive And free 
len ratingfive This is really amazing that you have all your files at your finger tips
len ratingfive Everywhere everything 
len ratingfive I like this
len ratingfive Best app
len ratingfive Needs it s own audio player stand alone app
len ratingfive I use it everywhere I go 
len ratingfive I am using Drive more and more with the intention of making it my one exclusive cloud storage for documents photos and more 
len ratingone Google you can do better 
len ratingone Come on 
len ratingfive Holds lots of files and it s easy to organize 
len ratingfive I started using Google Drive in school 
len ratingfive I enjoyed using it 
len ratingfive As I want to be an author I use Drive to organize my Google Docs full of ideas 
len ratingfive Whenever I am on vacation I get loads of creative ideas 
len ratingfive I don t usually bring my computer so I always grab my phone and start typing 
len ratingfive I adore this app and I ll be using it for years to come 
len ratingfive Google drive is a very reliable source of accessing stored data over the cloud 
len ratingfive I ve used several other cloud drives but Google drive has been the most dependable in my opinion 
len ratingfive The interface is very user friendly and the ability to arrange your files is impeccable 
len ratingtwo It would be much more convenient if I could actually know how much I have downloaded of a file when I m trying to download it from my drive to my phone 
len ratingfive This is a genius app and surprised google is so giving 
len ratingtwo The UI that had the buttons for team shared drives starred files my drive and shared with me at the bottom was by far and away the most user friendly and efficient design this app has ever seen 
len ratingtwo Why it was replaced with the current UI is beyond me 
len ratingtwo You ve made this app such a pain for daily users such as myself to navigate 
len ratingtwo The layout was about as close to perfection as it has ever been and now I have to relearn how to access my own information 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo I work in IT so quick efficient access to information is critical for me to be able to do my job well and this is now a hinderance 
len ratingtwo I ve been a fan of Google apps for a very long time because I could see the thought process behind UI layout on your apps for mobile devices and it made sense 
len ratingtwo They ve all been pretty easy to use until now 
len ratingtwo Two stars until someone puts some thought into making the UI layout easy for your users instead of using it to promote your newest feature 
len ratingone Need to fix that bug
len ratingfive Google don t F around 
len ratingone  and difficult to figure out how to use 
len ratingfive I absolutely love Google Drive 
len ratingfive It provides me with the information I need when I need it and The price is right 
len ratingfive TCP Minnesota
len ratingfive The drive is very simple and is excellent storage app 
len ratingfive It does so much more 
len ratingfive I am trying to fully understand it to be able to use it fully
len ratingfive Google docs helped me so much in school and other after school activities
len ratingthree Having trouble getting photos uploaded at once from iPhone
len ratingfive Jesus and this app is just alright with me
len ratingfive So glad to find this feature 
len ratingfive Love using it wish I d had it sooner 
len ratingfive I haven t been trained enough to maximize my utilization of your utilities
len ratingone  Would be nice to have multiple windows open 
len ratingfour I love Drive as my storage service 
len ratingone This program grabs every pic i take or save and puts them in Google Drive 
len ratingone I DO NOT WANT THIS 
len ratingone How do i turn that feature off 
len ratingone Garbage
len ratingone I m trying to send a Zip drive to this and it says it is unsupported 
len ratingone What do I do 
len ratingfour Please add more features to easily build an e Portfolio 
len ratingone What the heck is HEIC 
len ratingone Why can t it save my photos in the native format when uploading from my phone 
len ratingthree  Google Docs needs better DOCX to Google Doc format conversion especially when I have basic formatting like tables and drop caps 
len ratingone Not playing on iPhone
len ratingfour  I love this app especially since I can store my images videos in it but there s one issue I m dealing with 
len ratingfour The app sometimes crashes freezes or softlocks with all uploads at waiting whenever upload images or more at a time it will do it again if I try or more again 
len ratingfour I have to lower it to sometimes because of that to fix itself but still only to please look into that bug fix it 
len ratingfour Thank you
len ratingfive  I can use it for my name glitch on paper io its perfect
len ratingthree Love the app and desktop 
len ratingthree I hate the fact you cannot delete recents or remove recents from the list anymore 
len ratingthree Please bring that back 
len ratingthree It s just dumb to remove that
len ratingfive My old pictures
len ratingone I just updated this app and now it crashes after being open for more than a minute 
len ratingfive I appreciate Google Drive s ability to aid me in sharing files 
len ratingfive It s wonderful really 
len ratingfive Staying organized is essential 
len ratingfive I d like suggestions on how to keep everything manageable 
len ratingone I m confused 
len ratingfive Se me hace muy f cil y practico enviar documentos desde mi port til o mi m vil
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingthree Not sure if it s Apple or Google s fault but it s generally very difficult to get files out of drive and over to other iOS apps where it s even possible at all 
len ratingfive The entire Google line of products comes together through Drive 
len ratingfive I use Apple and Google interchangeably and they both offer necessary tools for managing digital 
len ratingfive I can t recommend one over the other it s both 
len ratingfive It s great for sending large files via email
len ratingfive I ve been so much more productive thanks to all of googles apps
len ratingfive How nice is the Google Drive app 
len ratingfive Listening to music seeing videos and many more 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive for listening music when I go to play with my sister 
len ratingfive Thanks to Google for making this great app 
len ratingfive Very user friendly and helps to maintain chores in life 
len ratingfive Una app s per necesaria y til 
len ratingfive Me encanta 
len ratingfive Very cool
len ratingfive It s a little difficult to learn how to navigate for instance I couldn t find the folders option for the longest time but once you do it is really cool 
len ratingfive You can even use it inside Apple as I am doing now 
len ratingfive If you have android and they give you free gigabytes it s yours so if you switch to Apple you can still store stuff there 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Always on the go with different devices 
len ratingfive Google drive helps keep me connected to all my data and I love it 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingthree It works 
len ratingthree Set aside 
len ratingfive  Awesome mobil app user friendly easy to use 
len ratingone NO SES PORQUE
len ratingtwo You can easily download video and audio files on mobile
len ratingfive Pleasant to share family snaps without any trouble
len ratingone It s not intuitive 
len ratingone Not for me 
len ratingone  Help will say on the menu select more select delete 
len ratingone There is no more choice under menu 
len ratingone And finding the home back button is hard 
len ratingone The top usual choices one would want to make and you have to go searching for how to do it 
len ratingthree The upload is not working with efficiency
len ratingone As title states
len ratingfour I love the app it houses all of my files and projects and the like but when I m working with Google Drive at night my eyes BURN 
len ratingfour Please create a dark mode for Drive 
len ratingfour It makes it all that much easier for us night workers 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingone  How long does this take 
len ratingone I ve been waiting way too long 
len ratingfive  iCloud has ruined mine due to storage costing me like how much per month I ain t getting billed for that but Thanks to google for storage saving from my photos and s t so i gotta delete my photos from my iPhone photos app so it won t cause me a problem for storage full
len ratingfive Awesome awesome super awesome I wouldn t know what to do without it 
len ratingfive Especially the offline mode option 
len ratingfive Brilliant Amony Addis Ababa Ethiopia
len ratingthree More than half the time I send video files with no problem 
len ratingthree However a bunch of times I m told my recipients are denied 
len ratingthree Whenever I m in a time crunch that s when my sharing fails 
len ratingthree It s great when it works 
len ratingthree  Just now got a text that a regular client is denied again 
len ratingthree Dang 
len ratingthree Come on google 
len ratingfive App
len ratingfive It Can Save Photos And Videos
len ratingfive It s awesome
len ratingfive  It helps me with my YouTube videos for gaming it s really helpful
len ratingfive  Review Optional 
len ratingfive Without google drive I don t know where we d be in school it plays a very large majority in school considering the fact that chrome books are used for just about every class 
len ratingthree I like the idea of saving files to be able access around the world 
len ratingthree However I had a lot of trouble accessing files that I had marked for offline use 
len ratingthree I m military and I spend a lot of time out in the desert where I don t have online access 
len ratingthree I thought this app would help me out with that but it was a total bust 
len ratingthree Maybe it was because I was using an apple product haha 
len ratingone This app is designed horribly 
len ratingone It keeps shutting down for no reason 
len ratingone Needs to restart every seconds 
len ratingone Absolutely horrible 
len ratingone Will be moving to iCloud Drive because this problem doesn t happen on that application 
len ratingfive Please 
len ratingfive Background download 
len ratingfive Great resource
len ratingone Used to work great then about weeks ago started crashing on my iPad 
len ratingone Went through typical steps to fix it but nothing worked 
len ratingone Then they updated today so I was hopeful that they fixed it 
len ratingone NOPE 
len ratingone Crashes even more frequently but I m stuck using it because it won t save my changes so that I can switch to my computer 
len ratingone I have lost so much work time due to these issues the last few weeks that I m ready to be done with Google forever 
len ratingthree The new update looks bad really preferred the old look 
len ratingthree Has a lot of issues with opening different formats still 
len ratingthree Really hope this gets fixed
len ratingfive Works great for our small group projects assignments and communication 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingone Stop stealing
len ratingthree It is difficult to use with my iPhone
len ratingone There is one link for App Support upon hitting that it says page not found so had to put it in review
len ratingfive  I was getting some photography done for a new release and I was able to import all my photos in like five minutes 
len ratingone Keeps crashing
len ratingfive HEART WARMING FUN TMES
len ratingfive But they should give more Gb that be lovely keep it google
len ratingone Video playback is buggy 
len ratingone Exiting from video playback is a nightmare getting you stuck in an infinite loop 
len ratingone Download management is terrible 
len ratingone Files never download properly and get stuck half way through 
len ratingone Thoroughly awful experience 
len ratingone If you have ANY other virtual drive platform I highly advise you to move away from this one 
len ratingfive Simple used and useful
len ratingfive My life is much better with Google
len ratingfive Yeyeyeyeyeyee
len ratingfive Love you guys so much 
len ratingfive I can always count on you guys to have my back in case a phone of mine breaks my files is gone 
len ratingfive You guys are always there 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingone Can t get the app to reliably upload photos either from within photos app or Drive app 
len ratingone One or two maybe otherwise it says processing and then nothing 
len ratingone Been this way for years and over many updates 
len ratingone I m tired of it and moving back to DropBox which worked better 
len ratingone I m a paying customer 
len ratingfive It has an important application as digital library 
len ratingfour Cool movies
len ratingone I have been trying to use this to manage documents and it has always been very slow 
len ratingfive I get to write down all of my stuff and make YouTube videos and intro s 
len ratingfive I really enjoyed the app 
len ratingfive Thank You Irene Playz
len ratingfour First in for most Google drive and many other connected software is are free to the public and connect to most people s email account 
len ratingfour This is ridiculously awesome which is why I gave these software is a four out of five 
len ratingfour Three issues I have 
len ratingfour One the software isn t very sophisticated 
len ratingfour Two The ease of picking and using new extensions to work with your many different types of documents is not easy at all 
len ratingfour three when collaborating on a document every time the screen is refreshed or you re open the document you have to reselect the type of editing style you want to use 
len ratingfour if the page Has to be refreshed because of an error which happens sometimes and you proceed to edit without thinking you may not be able to revert back which brings me to my final issue four though the constant saving of the software is appreciable it doesn t save every second because the undo feature and redo feature seem to always fail and you have to save the current work in mid flow which isn t the way the document was before or after the edit and then let the system burp fart and put things back the best it can remember 
len ratingfour It s the internet connectivity or something b c this happens for long ago saved changes as well as second ago changes 
len ratingfour That s it 
len ratingfour all being said I use Google docs religiously and I am ridiculously appreciating of how helpful and free it is 
len ratingfour In a world in which we are constantly complaining about technology which does nothing but improve every day we might consider just sucking it up and working with the software that we have 
len ratingfour This Google stuff gets four out of five stars across the board because it s not perfect which takes a star away but other than that it s amazing so only one star goes 
len ratingfour  now stop spying on us and oppressing our freedom of speech 
len ratingtwo Not easy to update the spreadsheet Spreadsheet not showing all the columns Overall unfriendly
len ratingfour It is very convenient to be able to create or draft an original on one device and then if needed see it on any of my other devices 
len ratingfour Also if needed I can retrieve it on someone else s device 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Nice to know I can have all my songs forever
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive In education it is important to share information 
len ratingfive Google drive has allowed me to network with educators in my school my district and everywhere 
len ratingfive I have used it to do projects and build folders to use and grow each year
len ratingfive I saved my resume on google drive 
len ratingfive It is a good app 
len ratingone using an iphone
len ratingfive Life saver in many ways 
len ratingfive Works flawlessly 
len ratingone This app never works whenever I need to upload video 
len ratingone It s always stuck in waiting and is impossible to share with 
len ratingone If anyone knows a more convenient way to upload video from your phone please let me know
len ratingfive Love saving all my files on a G Drive and able to access them from any device and from anywhere in the world 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Awesome toll to work sabe me a lot of time and trouble
len ratingthree good but crashes every five minutes when flipping through files with photos 
len ratingthree it s getting really annoying 
len ratingfive Fantastic way to share files via cellular or even faster via the WiFi connections 
len ratingfive Great service and best of all the lower storages are free 
len ratingfive Can t beat that 
len ratingfive Google Drive helps me access files when I need them and I can sometimes find myself in goofy places 
len ratingfive Thanks to the very smart and stylish people who make it work 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingone Google should stop suppressing legal conservative speech 
len ratingone Google should be broken up and severely regulated 
len ratingfour More Space
len ratingfive Google Doc is the greatest platform to create and save all documents for my business
len ratingone Can t edit in app 
len ratingfive This app not only keeps all of your files in one place it also works on many devices 
len ratingfive It makes it so much easier to keep track of your files even between multiple devices such as a work and a home computer 
len ratingfive This is a great app for people who use different computers or tablets 
len ratingfour MyHi year kiku w you dfyyt
len ratingfive I love the intuitive interface and the simplicity of sharing and collaborating 
len ratingfive I definitely recommend it to anyone including wizards 
len ratingone Now to access google drive one must allow for shared information to google and enable access to entire photo library in order to save a single picture 
len ratingone This is not acceptable and a serious reason for privacy concerns 
len ratingfive  not 
len ratingone Any video file I load up doesn t work on anything but my computer
len ratingone I ve deleted stuff and emptied them off trash but the drive is still full 
len ratingone Can t figure out what it is
len ratingfive The program or app helped me with numerous tasks within my business college and upcoming projects 
len ratingone Can t open adobe document
len ratingone Not easy to transfer my files from iCloud Drive 
len ratingone Can t delete files 
len ratingone Bad business and organization methods 
len ratingfive I Love it and using it everytime everyday anywhere with ease very useful drive but i request to developer that please bring passcode or touch ID unlock feature in Google Drive App so that we can add extra security layer on our mobile google drive app also so please bring it as soon as possible in new update we will be waiting for 
len ratingfive Thanks Regard Dr Farhan
len ratingfive Using drive in both a personal and work environment has allowed me to keep all of my files in an easy to find location 
len ratingfive I can access and edit all content from my any device anywhere 
len ratingfive  So consistent across all platforms
len ratingfive  great app
len ratingfive Best cloud storage IMHO
len ratingfive I have drive in every aspect of my universe 
len ratingfive Trustworthy handy and accessible 
len ratingone No success with opening file
len ratingtwo No option to delete A PDF file 
len ratingtwo Have gone on the Internet to figure out how to do it 
len ratingtwo The option to delete it is just not available 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating 
len ratingfive This is such a great useful tool 
len ratingfive The Lost Northern Tribe uses it to get our act together 
len ratingone I want to be able to complete the Google slide it in the Google Drive app
len ratingfive And it works well 
len ratingone  Is bad because sharing sometims not work
len ratingfive Great job 
len ratingfive high HD photos
len ratingone Scam unsafe 
len ratingone If you login to any google platform app or parent company such as you tube You will be login all the time 
len ratingone This is very unsafe and your info is open to virus and other scamers such as google 
len ratingone Try it If you are signed in in you tube 
len ratingone Go to google g mail and is going to be already open and the worst thing is that they track every movement in your phone not browser 
len ratingone SCAM safety is not their number one priority 
len ratingthree  Touch ID 
len ratingfive If it s from Google it must be good
len ratingfour Really great app would love to make listening out of drive easier
len ratingfive Van
len ratingfive Great way to efficiently store documents files photos 
len ratingone Como faz para tirar arquivos 
len ratingone Apanhando aqui 
len ratingone Just updated Drive but it still has the major security glitch where the entire home page just shows all of your recently opened files 
len ratingfive  This app is great for installing files for games and even for your classroom 
len ratingone I m even looking at the support section and it says there should be a delete option next to a file and I m not seeing anything 
len ratingone Where did it go 
len ratingone Do better Google dang 
len ratingone  iphoneplus Queen
len ratingone This is horrible and not user friendly at all 
len ratingone Very confusing
len ratingone This app crashes on my phone nearly every time I use it 
len ratingone I have to upload photos for work very frequently and it s a huge inconvenience 
len ratingone I love the desktop version of drive but the app has not been my friend 
len ratingone There is no way to offload data 
len ratingone Everything that I have in drive automatically gets downloaded to my ipad and with limited space is a hassle 
len ratingone Please add away to only download the documents that you need 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingthree I have to go to google drive on my browser and be redirected to the app instead of having access via a convenient app on my home screen 
len ratingfive Good application es el mejor
len ratingone Icons aren t there 
len ratingfive I can upload files from any device and retrieve them from any device it fantastic
len ratingone Tried everything 
len ratingone The just will not update on my iPhone S 
len ratingone Love the app 
len ratingone Just wish it would update 
len ratingfive Useful for retrieving the records Stars
len ratingone  I use to use Drive but now when open the app it immediately shows all of the files you have recently opened so it is unusable now 
len ratingtwo This app takes forever to load anything 
len ratingfive Uberytransportation is the cheap taxi service near you in Orlando the one only you can chusted whit your credit card
len ratingtwo The app crashes alot 
len ratingtwo Trying to upload things from my phones is practically more of a hassle than just pulling out a computer 
len ratingtwo I can however access anything already uploaded and thatz nice
len ratingfive It s just a must have if you handle share documents routinely 
len ratingtwo I only downloaded this app to upload videos from my camera and download them onto my phone I have more them enough storage and I should be able to download the videos 
len ratingtwo Anytime I try to download the videos they never appear in my photo album 
len ratingtwo Fix this please 
len ratingfive muy buena y perfecta rapida y convincente en su uso
len ratingfive It fast acceptable easy to use and most of all convenience 
len ratingone I duck people 
len ratingfive  Nice to save documents too quickly from emails to view later
len ratingfive  The title says all 
len ratingfive Shut up and get this app it s worth it
len ratingfive Es lo mejor
len ratingthree Good for storage but takes a very long time to retrieve saved files from the drive
len ratingfive Thank you Google
len ratingone When trying to close a file it doesn t want to close 
len ratingone It takes multiple taps to do so 
len ratingone Extremely irritating 
len ratingfive  This app as always been better than apples iCloud to me for a single reason being you get some much storage space for free which for anyone who takes a bunch of pictures or needs to share photos this is the app for you 
len ratingfive The only thing I think could be improved is how many photos you can upload at once you can already do a bunch at once but sometimes you choose one to many and it won t upload at all 
len ratingfive Besides that it s a great app that anyone could benefit from having 
len ratingtwo This app is clunky 
len ratingtwo When I email large files the receiving party should automatically be given access 
len ratingtwo This does not happen and in fact it s difficult to set permissions after posting the data 
len ratingtwo In my last post of images the recipient got permission to view only some of them 
len ratingtwo Aggravating 
len ratingfive I have used it in the pass and return with the new product 
len ratingfive Thanks a bunch
len ratingfive N
len ratingfive This app is great to share files and save files great for both platforms
len ratingtwo I m using on iPad app crash a lot while using shared folder watching image 
len ratingtwo Please fix it 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingfive Love is drive 
len ratingfour Room for improvements 
len ratingfour Better loading by titles to hold space even if no connection 
len ratingfour Better formatting options to show what s in the drive quickly 
len ratingfour Menus are everywhere finding right ones or what s available talked too much time 
len ratingfour Previouly used Android for irate 
len ratingone As a musician I use google drive quite a bit to save and share files recently using an iPad I have found its not compatible with it 
len ratingone Please fix this issue as it makes it very inconvenient since I use a recording software on said device 
len ratingfive  I have been using note taking apps for forever and Google Drive is by far the best one 
len ratingfive I have used Evernote and Samsung Notes and various others but this one has always been the Best especially for large projects and such 
len ratingfive The only thing I would change is that there s no way to take notes about random stuff on this app without it being a huge inconvenience but then they solved that with Google Keep 
len ratingfive  It works good
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Totally recommend this 
len ratingfive This app is extremely convenient love it
len ratingfive It saves me a lot of time and space on my phone Im able to upload thousands of pictures and not worry about running out of space thank you 
len ratingfive I do not use this app it is not installed on any devices I use I do not nor should I have to update it
len ratingfive It works beautifully
len ratingfive I ve seen worse
len ratingfive Personally I love google drive it s so convenient having all types of documents in one place that can be accessed on any device and it automatically saves too so if a power outage occurs while you work you don t lose you work 
len ratingfive If you need to share a document with someone who doesn t have a google account there s this great feature to save the document as a pdf 
len ratingfive The only slight inconvenience I can think of is needing WiFi to use it but most places have WiFi these days anyway so that is basically never a problem 
len ratingtwo These bug fixes are not working I cannot attach my files to email without it continuously closing sometimes works if I close my iPad completely off and that doesn t always work 
len ratingtwo Today I needed to open files IMPORTANT FILES to print and to send in email I get a widow pop up SOMETHING ISN T WORKING TRY AGAIN LATTER I want my files when I NEED THEM not if and when drive decides to work properly 
len ratingtwo Very upset and now wishing I had my files located in a different format and filing system 
len ratingtwo Fix it I want me files and want to easily copy to another app since this isn t working for me
len ratingfour Works fine except if you make a shared folder with friends you have to download each file individually 
len ratingfour So terrible to use if you re trying to share photos with friends on your phone
len ratingfive One of the great apps simply you can said google drive is holding your data and provide it to you anywhere anytime through all devices just said a great app 
len ratingfive Taher Khalifa
len ratingone Takes forever for photos to load 
len ratingone Every time 
len ratingone Have to wait forever to see the contents of a folder
len ratingtwo Un pregunta por qu compreo espacio y no me lo dan o actualizo el sestema y en ves de ir para ri a ba para abajo
len ratingone VERY disappointed in Goggle 
len ratingone This is SO frustrating 
len ratingfive Thank yours Google is good 
len ratingfive That is realyholp for I don t have to buy spec Thanks very much 
len ratingfour Great platform to use 
len ratingfour Keep it up 
len ratingone It is too difficult to figure out how to use this 
len ratingone Not suitable with instructions as given 
len ratingone Too restrictive 
len ratingthree Always asking for feedback is annoying
len ratingfive Really helpful in keeping your files organized and very easy to find
len ratingtwo Google drive cannot be accessed thru iOS sharing 
len ratingtwo It puts a holt to any type of productivity via the iPhone 
len ratingtwo I am a heavy user of google drive on my laptop which I love 
len ratingtwo Only wish google and apple could extend that to mobile platform 
len ratingfive Have it all with Drive 
len ratingfive Anything I need is securely stored in my drive 
len ratingfive I love how easy to use it is and no matter where I am at my papers and files are always near me 
len ratingfive Photos too

len ratingfive The gb of free storage works and no matter where I am I always has access to information 
len ratingfive It s a must have Love
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingthree I really like Google Drive because it simplifies sharing documents 
len ratingthree I recently got married and virtually everything was done through Google Drive such as contracts photos and even templates for invitations 
len ratingthree However I recently got all my wedding pictures from the photographer and the app doesn t last for more than a couple minutes before crashing 
len ratingthree Then I have to speed through all the photos I ve already seen to get to where I was and try to look at as much as possible before it crashes again 
len ratingthree I d love it if this were fixed 
len ratingthree I upload a lot of pictures in a workday and use Drive to edit Docs Sheets and other Google apps 
len ratingthree My Drive app crashes at least times in hours 
len ratingthree It doesn t lose what I was working on it just makes it more time consuming to do simple tasks

len ratingfive  Excellent 
len ratingfive Absolutely
len ratingone Sooooooo baaaaaaad

len ratingone Where s the security 
len ratingone Document that thought secure show up on this site 
len ratingtwo In the app I am unable to send folders files outside of my company email 
len ratingtwo The option simply does not exist like it does on the web desktop 
len ratingtwo This is IMPERATIVE for me to send files to clients 
len ratingtwo Google please fix 
len ratingfive Love the cloud for backing up my art portfolio 
len ratingone The application seems to crash when you doing a larger format photo folder 
len ratingone Tested on iPhone and S max on iOS 
len ratingfive Great phenomenal spectacular outstanding superb 
len ratingfive  Wonderful
len ratingfive It s good
len ratingfive  I love using it it backs up my files automatically 
len ratingtwo I use Drive primarily for managing photos in my iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo Recent updates have reduced the number of thumbnails available visible on screen resulting in lots of wasted unused screen space 
len ratingtwo Also half the time the thumbnails won t even load even when photos are set to available offline which defeats the purpose of using it 
len ratingtwo I would use Apple s native Files app but it won t display thumbnails at all 
len ratingtwo I assume this is Google s fault since Files shows thumbnails from DropBox and iCloud perfectly 
len ratingtwo Finally when saving an image to Drive from another app web browser or Twitter for example it doesn t preserve the file s original name or allow you to give it a custom name 
len ratingtwo Every image gets named File png 
len ratingtwo Dumb 
len ratingfive Google Drive fits all of my needs 
len ratingfive Great job Google 
len ratingtwo I am able to stream in video from google drive link shared with me 
len ratingtwo However when I press download icon I see temp filename and then page reverts to initial page to open folder
len ratingtwo I use this app quite often to write but this upgrade is just terrible 
len ratingtwo Anyway to downgrade 
len ratingtwo I create many folders to sort out my thoughts and everything but now all I see are these files and documents 
len ratingone Whenever you want to share a video it always auto plays the video and the UI blocks you from actually being able to hit the share button 
len ratingone the new update is awful 
len ratingone please revert it back 
len ratingone I can t find any of my necessary folders and it only shows specific folders even when I search up other ones 
len ratingone The older version was much easier to use and find files 
len ratingfive Love it because I can use it with everything anytime anywhere 
len ratingone  items failed to back up 
len ratingone Which 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone How to solve 
len ratingone No data 
len ratingone Just typical for the company that only has beta products 
len ratingtwo Why can t a person edit in One Drive 
len ratingtwo That would be a great addition to it 
len ratingfive i want to ask if I change my phone is the image in my old phone still correct 
len ratingfive TvT please answer me
len ratingtwo Add password settings 
len ratingfive We
len ratingtwo  It is slow many times even on good connections 
len ratingtwo  It crashes when uploading multiple files from the phone You cannot tell files count from the App 
len ratingtwo  Could have a better and more user friendly interface Could be better overall especially it is an app from google alphabet competitors like DropBox and iCloud are much better 
len ratingone the upload speed and percentages 
len ratingfive I ve just started using but I like what I ve seen so far
len ratingtwo The title says it all 
len ratingtwo I can generally find things OK on my desktop systems but on mobile forget it 
len ratingtwo They screw around with the interface too much 
len ratingtwo Just leave it alone 
len ratingtwo And the default view upon opening Drive should be my primary folders 
len ratingtwo Documents Photos etc 
len ratingthree No dark mode 
len ratingthree Colors and UI make me think of clowns 
len ratingthree Other than that I mean it works 
len ratingone When I try to open a docx file in Files or iCloud Drive the Google Drive app automatically opens and asks me to save the file in that app 
len ratingone Then I can t find or open it 
len ratingone This is terrible 
len ratingone Any fix 
len ratingfive Outstanding application 
len ratingfive I just use this for typing stories and random things 
len ratingfive It s pretty nice though I d prefer to type on the computer 
len ratingfive Okay bye 
len ratingfour Once I have used it enough I will be better able to assess it s usability accessibility and efficacy 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone Not user friendly
len ratingfive It is good
len ratingtwo Google drive is great but for a good year or two now the google drive app won t download photos in high res 
len ratingtwo It reduces photos to a few KB and I m so surprised it hasn t been fixed yet 
len ratingtwo If google drive fixes this then it s a near perfect application 
len ratingfive Best Drive ever 
len ratingfive Accessible anywhere I go 
len ratingfive I can always share edit and upload even from my phone on a road trip 
len ratingone Can t email files can t download files

len ratingfive Very organized
len ratingfour I m missing some pictures from my drive 
len ratingfour How do I retrieve them 
len ratingfive I LOVE AMAZON
len ratingfive This is the best app on my phone
len ratingfour Google Drive is easy to use for so many things and it is so convenient to have it all in one place 
len ratingfour The only issues I have are how complicated it is so save or download photos from Drive to Google Photos and printing sometimes doesn t come out as well so I have to copy and paste to Microsoft Word to print in the right layout 
len ratingfive  Archivo
len ratingfive I have found this app very easy to use 
len ratingfive Gone are the days when I used to worry about losing my hard drive 
len ratingfive It works very well with the both mobile phone and computer 
len ratingtwo I love Google Drive and it s so nice to use when sharing pics and documents with friends etc 
len ratingtwo But I cannot STAND the mobile app 
len ratingtwo My friends will send photos through drive and I attempt to view them on mobile BUT THE APP CRASHES NON STOP so I can only get through a few before it decides it hates me 
len ratingtwo It s extremely aggravating 
len ratingone An image that is nearly mb becomes a tenth of its size kb when downloaded to my iPhone via the traditional method of Send a copy Save Image 
len ratingone I have to make a shared link and go to it on a browser to download it at full size 
len ratingone How is this acceptable 
len ratingone How is this not fixed yet 
len ratingone This is affecting your ratings as many people have complained about this 
len ratingone Please fix it immediately 
len ratingfive This app is incredibly useful for keeping track of records and files 
len ratingfive I like my hunting and fishing licenses on my drive 
len ratingfive Additionally I have a lot of certificates the I use for resumes that are always accessible and confidentiality is a crucial feature 
len ratingfive There are other apps that work well G Docs as well 
len ratingfive You can take a photo or scan a document and store it safely 
len ratingfive I live on the road and like to limit bulk and weight so I keep a lot of records in G Docs 
len ratingfive This is a great online storage app 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Please add encrypted access
len ratingfour Uploading is a slow but they may be my WiFi connection but I don t think so
len ratingtwo I m not very tech savvy and I understand that but after minutes of research I still can t figure out how to move a gd google doc from the google doc app to a file I created in google drive in the separate google drive app 
len ratingtwo This is pretty rediculous 
len ratingtwo Google drive even allows me to create a new google doc takes me to the google doc app where I can see the google doc that has been made but I can t select it 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo Why can t I select a created document 
len ratingtwo It makes absolutely no sense 
len ratingtwo I m glad you asked how I m liking the app 
len ratingtwo Seems like you haven t thought much about iPads 
len ratingtwo Why even have the apps 
len ratingtwo I m only going to assume your hardware is just as absent of thought 
len ratingtwo I m so frustrated because there are so few options I even have so I don t believe I m lost 
len ratingtwo I really dislike this 
len ratingone Time waster disappointment total frustration
len ratingfive Very user friendly and works across multiple devices

len ratingtwo I have a iPad with all the bells and whistles and updated iOS 
len ratingtwo I watch intructional videos from a class 
len ratingtwo I don t want to download the videos to my iPad The interface for watching is clumsy 
len ratingtwo Click upper left to switch to a screen where you can pause or move forward or back click upper left to a screen you can close the video or expand it 
len ratingtwo Really 
len ratingtwo Can t it all be on one screen 
len ratingtwo I frequently pause the videos and use another app come back to the video and it won t load just a spinning indicator of it loading 
len ratingtwo I have to close the app and open it search for my video all over again scrub forward to get to my last viewed place and start over 
len ratingtwo I can t believe Google would develop an app that is so clumsy 
len ratingtwo I tried watching the video reduced in app and it plays but if I pause it won t reload 
len ratingtwo I don t have a choice to use this app for these classes 
len ratingtwo My only option is to download to Dropbox 
len ratingfive  I m having adjustment issues to be honest 
len ratingfive I was thinking that I still needed to look far and wide for my resume and lo and behold it was right here glad I found it

len ratingfive What else is there to say 
len ratingfive Share docs remotely with edits 
len ratingfive  Great tool to have
len ratingone Trashy and buggy

len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive Simple to use 
len ratingfive Straight forward 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive good
len ratingthree It s really annoying that my videos won t upload unless I keep my phone on the screen watching it 
len ratingthree That takes hours 
len ratingthree If I leave the page for too long the upload starts all over again 
len ratingfive I really like this app because it halls me do stuff on the go 
len ratingfive And on my chromebook and it saves all my changes
len ratingtwo Slow and unresponsive on my old iPad after newest update to iOS 
len ratingthree My google drive on my phone doesn t update sync with my pc 
len ratingthree Or I m not sure how to sync it 
len ratingthree It s on same account
len ratingone Para google llc esque yo descarge un apk ese apk se llama aptoide apk y no me deja buscarlo arreglenlo plz
len ratingthree There s no way to delete files on here 
len ratingthree So annoying 
len ratingfive I love the fact that I can upload anything to my google drive and access it on any of my devices
len ratingfive Can access file from anywhere
len ratingfive Google Drive was easy to setup invite contributors and share documents 
len ratingfive The rest is just details 
len ratingfive It has been my go to cloud service for about years and no complaints it s fast reliable and most important safe 
len ratingfive Stop hassling me
len ratingfive  Best app for storing documents on different devices 
len ratingfive Recommend it 
len ratingone I want to be able to cast it onto my tv 
len ratingfive  Super handy too 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It s easy 
len ratingfive And it hold and save all of your important documents 
len ratingfour Great app 
len ratingfour I still however have trouble with Arabic Hebrew typing 
len ratingfour Google has a strange auto correct such that you can never put a number to the left of an Arabic or Hebrew letter 
len ratingfive  Good to have 
len ratingone I loved google drive and then they stopped allowing drive to save videos to camera roll 
len ratingone Lame 
len ratingone  stars down to 
len ratingfour Didn t know Google could do so much 
len ratingfour Now I just gotta explore 
len ratingtwo Latest update is very slow on the upload 
len ratingfive I enjoy using this product 
len ratingfive Very consistent 
len ratingfive  I use this to download hacked files on the internet
len ratingfive  Esta aplicaci n funciona correctamente y es integrada en su funcionalidad
len ratingone not willing to shake hands with a deceptive and manipulative company 
len ratingone deleted all our accounts across all google services 
len ratingone There are still a lot of glitches 
len ratingone Many of my files have been converted and damaged to the point where they can no longer be opened 
len ratingone This continues to happen regularly and I ve contacted customer support but they have yet to find a solution 
len ratingone It s a great idea but I don t feel comfortable saving my documents on you anymore for fear of being lost 
len ratingone Simple task 
len ratingone Can t seem to get it right 
len ratingone Downloading a file just takes me to the file and not allow me to save to my phone 
len ratingfour Good but nothings perfect 
len ratingtwo Poor integration with iPhone 
len ratingtwo My android phone allows as an editable scan and color choices 
len ratingtwo iPhone only allows a picture with no options or cropping and comes over as a pic 
len ratingtwo Terrible
len ratingone It destroys all of your files throwing everything into a jumbled mess and losing half your documents
len ratingfive NJSLA
len ratingfive Super helpful and flexible storage and sharing 
len ratingfive Collaborative hub of handiness 
len ratingfive Very good app 
len ratingfive It is always there like a good friend 
len ratingfive  Excellent service reasonable price 
len ratingfive Love Google apps and cloud so convenient 
len ratingfive Did you know that you can import audios in medly with this 
len ratingthree Not ok Google 
len ratingthree Surely the company of your resources can write an app that doesn t crash every seconds when flipping through a folder of images
len ratingfive Can you make an option where you can copy a folder 
len ratingfive I love using Google drive 
len ratingfive I use it to store pictures documents programs and it is easy to access 
len ratingfive Sometimes people hack in my account but not this website
len ratingone The functions are very confusing especially desktop version 
len ratingone Not recommend at all 
len ratingone Took me a long time to figurr out what it does
len ratingtwo Why do I need to download all of the other apps just to use this one 
len ratingtwo Why not just make this one more accessible this really doesn t need to exist
len ratingone The google drive was essential to my personal and professional academic life 
len ratingone Not sure what happened but it no longer works with my iPad Pro 
len ratingone It won t save edits and when I try to do simple tasks such as cut and paste it freezes 
len ratingone I have to close the program down 
len ratingone I can basically only use it as a read only mode 
len ratingone I emailed google and no one contacted me back 
len ratingone I sure hope this is fixed because it was a great app before 
len ratingfive Excellent platform for teaching and learning 
len ratingfive Seamlessly proficient don t know what I d do without it 
len ratingfour If a change was made on a computer then mobile Google Drive refuses to catch up with it 
len ratingfour Also there are audio bugs when I upload audio to Files
len ratingfive Has definitely come in clutch when I need to send a coworker files on the fly 
len ratingfour  T t
len ratingtwo The desktop program works fine and the desktop site is good but the mobile app is basically broken by the fact that the search function is so terrible 
len ratingtwo It doesn t let me sort by date and instead orders by relevancy which doesn t appear to follow any pattern 
len ratingtwo This makes it hard to use and is annoying because I pay for my drive account 
len ratingtwo I m thinking of taking my money elsewhere to avoid the hassle 
len ratingtwo All it needs is a search function that looks and behaves just like the desktop website and it would be a star app 
len ratingtwo That and add an ability to sync entire folders offline not just files 
len ratingone Google gets its tendrils deeper 
len ratingfive This is a great app cloud really convenient 
len ratingone O programa congela
len ratingone It s okay
len ratingone I wish this worked better 
len ratingone Antes funcionaba de maravilla en mi tel fono era r pido bajaba de inmediato todo y las pre visualizaciones eran muy giles por eso le di una estrella por favor dejen de mejorarlo antes funcionaba mejor
len ratingthree pictures don t save at full resolution and please bring back the old selection system where you could easily open folders while moving files 
len ratingone Used to be fine but since two updates ago uploading Live Photos locks the app 
len ratingone Is this is a scam to get us to use google photos 
len ratingone Where we cannot separate which photos we don t want google to see 
len ratingone  stars 
len ratingfour Love the app 
len ratingfour It s easy to use and it s very familiar to the actual website 
len ratingfour However in my school I use a lot of office apps as well as google 
len ratingfour This app has no native app launcher for office apps 
len ratingfour Instead it uses the online office editor from google 
len ratingfour So I have to use the files app from apple because it gives me the option to effortlessly open the file in the respected app 
len ratingfive Google drive is such a great way to keep all of your important letters and work in an efficient organized app 
len ratingfive I don t know what I would do without it 
len ratingone Crashes every time I open it
len ratingfive Google s My Drive is easy reliable accessible convenient and a pleasure to use 
len ratingfive I wish the iPhone version worked more like the computer version where adding to a folder using Google Docs is simple and automatic 
len ratingfive In my iPhone I have to move the new insert manually and it isn t easy 
len ratingone I think it s a really annoying feature and I wish I could turn it off 
len ratingfive Good place to store files
len ratingfive In addition to storing files this is an excellent way to share files with others 
len ratingone I had stuff either on docs or drive or sumphin like them 
len ratingone WHERE ARE THEY NOW 
len ratingfive It s good 
len ratingfive Life changing 
len ratingfive I m a music artist business owner this app definitely helps me stay organize 
len ratingfive I can work from anywhere as long as there s phone reception 
len ratingfive Very expressed
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I am one of those who loses passwords sometimes and the occasional running out of hard drive space 
len ratingfive I lose things it seems every time but I find that I have saved lots of items using Drive that are still available and working 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfour it s good but the new interface is confusing 
len ratingfive It s very reliable and is good for school work too 
len ratingfive Overall brilliant app
len ratingone Slow slow slow
len ratingfive  Google Drive is absolutely indispensable in teamwork 
len ratingfive This may be the year that I stop paying Microsoft and go percent Google apps 
len ratingfive Haven t lost a file since this development
len ratingfive I absolutely love this drive space and all my content is safe and easy to find 
len ratingfive Thank you for all the options and information I can retain for preview along with a review 
len ratingone My video won t stop processing and won t play 
len ratingtwo  pictures don t save at full resolution and with the latest update you can t select files 
len ratingtwo also please bring back the old selection system where you could easily open folders while moving files 
len ratingfive Excellent tool for members of the Hammond Education Foundation 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingtwo June Search features is not good have to type the whole name for the file to come up 
len ratingtwo It s the same way on the desktop browser 
len ratingtwo July Every time there is new update 
len ratingtwo The upload feature can only detect pictures videos from that point on not good 
len ratingtwo  For king of all searches 
len ratingtwo It doesn t always find some docs when I search for them in the app 
len ratingtwo Especially pictures that I have named 
len ratingfour I downloaded music to the google drive and it say unsupported file what do I do I need it for my important project is due on Monday
len ratingone When I st try this about years ago it had the same problem as now uploading take forever just to upload photo and it just freezes or very slowly to upload the next photo wish more people would complain about this so that for once Google would just fix the dam problem instead of app baiting those of us who use cross platforms devices in our daily life
len ratingone El ltimo dise o est muy feo y malo para m vil esto es motivo de eliminar la app y cambiarse a otra nube 
len ratingfour Pretty good app for general activities
len ratingfive Excellent program app 
len ratingfive I use it daily 
len ratingfive Fast and flexible at a good price 
len ratingone I rate star because I use my phone for work and I don t have an option to not show my recently opened files 
len ratingone No accident happens to me yet but how annoying if I open the app and someone sees NSFW images like the pictures of my wife and I on the beach with bikini on one day 
len ratingone I will uninstall this app until you guys add this feature 
len ratingone Word is better
len ratingtwo I ve been using google drive for years now 
len ratingtwo I ve always had problems moving documents between google drive and my gmail using my iPhone 
len ratingtwo It seems like it could be an iPhone issue in the way the iPhone works with the google drive and gmail systems 
len ratingtwo I also have problems taking documents from google drive editing them saving them and sending them 
len ratingtwo These problems are exclusively on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo When used on a computer google drive has always worked great 
len ratingfive Vi
len ratingthree I love the convenience of this app 
len ratingthree I have the ability organize and access all of my files wherever I am 
len ratingthree I also love the ability to flip back and forth between my work and personal accounts 
len ratingthree HOWEVER recently the app keeps shutting down on me 
len ratingthree I ve downloaded the new version that claims to have fixed the bugs but it hasn t helped 
len ratingthree I m BEGGING for an update that doesn t close the app while I m in it 
len ratingone It won t save my stuff
len ratingfive Oh so good
len ratingtwo Google drive works great on a computer but on your phone it can t do anything 
len ratingtwo In order to edit anything you have to have the app specific to what ever kind of thing it is doc sheet slide etc 
len ratingtwo  so drive really serves no purpose
len ratingfive its great to get to use this easy to use online storage of many different commonly needed file and document types 
len ratingfive its a an excellent business support function 
len ratingone  How come after this many years that Google drive released there is still no option scroll through your files when you listen to music 
len ratingone Even on the computer you can t do it 
len ratingone Fix this it s really annoying 
len ratingtwo There are many features that can be easily implemented into this app but yet after years you guys haven t added the option to browse other files while it is playing viewing another file such as videos and music 
len ratingtwo I don t like that you can t edit documents in this app 
len ratingtwo What s the point of separating it all out 
len ratingfive Best EVER 
len ratingthree  I have noticed that when I open some folders they appear the same way they did a month ago 
len ratingthree Pull to refresh will update the content but when returning to the same folder later it will have reverted back to the previous state 
len ratingfive Awesome to keep track of your files and having quick access to them and sharing
len ratingone Files listing with same account but different devices are different
len ratingthree I love using Google apps on my android phone because it is so smooth but it is quite laggy on my relatively new iPad 
len ratingthree Hope there will be more updates to fix this 
len ratingthree Overall it works fine but laggy when scrolling 
len ratingone Like all the time
len ratingfive This is a great app to use 
len ratingfive You can make folders to organize your things 
len ratingfive It is a really useful app when im at school it store and keeps all my projects organized 
len ratingfive I suggested you get this app 
len ratingfive It is not a waste of time if you ask me 
len ratingfive  This is a very versatile app of which there many applications one can use this particular app 
len ratingone I am a photographer and I typically transfer photos from my camera to my laptop to my phone via my Google Drive 
len ratingone However lately then I ve been viewing the photos on my Google Drive app on my phone as I swipe through the images the app will repeatedly crash 
len ratingfive I recommend this app to anyone 
len ratingfive It is really working for us 
len ratingone I m having a dickens of a time sending photos attached to an email to my friends 
len ratingone They have to keep asking for permission to view 
len ratingone This was never an issue but is now and is driving me crazy 
len ratingfive Why not use a google pixel instead of an IPHONE
len ratingfive Awesome is just one word that describes Google Drive 
len ratingfive And it s free get out 
len ratingfive A powerful business tool that can be used to share files and so much more 
len ratingfive This app is only limited by your imagination 
len ratingfive Use it to share information about a reunion or birthday or even any upcoming events like a wedding 
len ratingfive I love Google 
len ratingfive Can you tell 
len ratingfive nuts
len ratingthree Scan feature works along with cropping 
len ratingthree However app will not allow me to email it to myself which is frustrating 
len ratingfive  Really good app but some times it s really bad
len ratingthree  It would be really nice if you were able to cast videos using the chromecast 
len ratingthree When scrolling through files on a device the app is too sensitive and thinks I m trying to select the file 
len ratingthree It s so frustrating when you re trying to find something through multiple documents 
len ratingthree Wish you could use passcodes 
len ratingthree Was removed awhile ago 
len ratingfive Oh wow that s how you feel like I gotta do ya want to go home and I don t get my mom and my dad to come over for me and then I m going on my mom to school I don t want her mom and she just want me and her to come and get me a lot and I m gonna is it a little one to get my grandpa to go there I don t want you guys going on the bus or not I wanna was the night you got me trippin was the night you got me to come and get it and it started raining so here is a lot going on and I m gonna was a nice night I was gonna was the day you got me trippin I wanna know how you are gonna I was gonna I wanna was a good day I hope you have a good day and I love you bye bye love you bye love ya bye bye love ya mom and I love ok this is starting to get embarrassing bye 
len ratingtwo App crashes if a larger folder is opened
len ratingone Drive usually works great on all devices but for whatever reason it constantly crashes on my iPhone I need it for school photography so it makes things way more difficult since if you re doing something as simple as scrolling through documents for a while it will randomly crash 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive It would be great to have search on google drive for my iPhone
len ratingfive Podr a perder el celular pero no mis fotos
len ratingone We went on a trip with family and extended family 
len ratingone All the photos everyobe took were shared via google drive

len ratingthree Please help
len ratingfive Great project Great Video
len ratingfive Google drive is always their when you need it and so convenient 
len ratingfive I like the easy use and convenience 
len ratingfive  I love how all of google s apps are connected 
len ratingfive It s so easy to organize my files and maneuver between email and documents 
len ratingfive It s also easy to share and collaborate with others 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingone Can t save videos to my camera role it s quite irritating
len ratingfour Could you please add a rapid scroll feature 
len ratingfour Like a scroll bar you can drag 
len ratingfour It s a real pain to have to scroll through a large document 
len ratingfour No complaints with the storage or cloud service 
len ratingfive Drive is one of my most used and valuable personal and business organizational tools 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingfive I really love this how they share tips and a filing system helps me stay organized 
len ratingfive Very calming and influential 
len ratingone It s great for storage but that s it 
len ratingone Won t let me download my files to my phone 
len ratingone Just won t work 
len ratingone Super slow 
len ratingone When you have employees leave the files still belong to them and access become denied or the file is attributed to someone not even at the org 
len ratingone When I change phones give one to my family member GD still requires vertification with an old phone I no longer have in my possession 
len ratingone Sure I can change to another way but it s a pain to do so every time 
len ratingone File storage has become auto sorted by name and not by modification date causing slowed work output 
len ratingone I can go on and on 
len ratingone That is just today s reminder of the pile GD has become 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive No better app for the simplist of tasks Organizing photos videos and files in folders neatly 
len ratingfive Very satisfying for perfectionists 
len ratingfour Good 
len ratingfive  ICloud Dropbox Box you name it 
len ratingfive Google Drive wins 
len ratingfive I just use it more 
len ratingfive And it is a bargain 
len ratingfive I m gonna get rid of all my other cloud based storage drives 
len ratingone Video may never finish uploading
len ratingone A key component of any file management app is the ability to take a file and open it in other apps 
len ratingone Google Drive completely lacks this capability apparently they only designed this as a file viewer but you can t actually use any of the files you have in any other program besides Google Drive 
len ratingone If you have a document and you want to open it in Notes you are not allowed to do that 
len ratingone If you have a song and you want to open it in a song editing program you are not allowed to do that 
len ratingone This is completely stupid 
len ratingone You should use a full featured file management app to access your google drive instead of this dumb app 
len ratingone Readdle Documents works pretty great 
len ratingfive I ve been using Cloud storage since it came out 
len ratingfive In corporate and home settings 
len ratingfive Google is hands down the absolute best 
len ratingone Crashes all the time
len ratingone Do not like the format 
len ratingone Hard to find pics Would rather use google photos
len ratingone Saving documents on iOS to the drive just produces a text file 
len ratingone What s the point of even having an iOS app if you can t save files to the drive 
len ratingfive I use this site for many documents 
len ratingfive The convenience helps me complete everyday tasks and school work with ease 
len ratingfive Super good 
len ratingfive Free 
len ratingfive Let s you type stuff make slideshows and more for free
len ratingtwo Bit of a joke
len ratingfive This app is really good it seems to have an unlimited storage space it s amazing 
len ratingfive I save almost everything on here all of my pictures videos and any important documents 
len ratingfive But when I saved something onto google drive on my iPad and opened it up later on my phone the videos weren t there 
len ratingfive And yes I am positive that I uploaded them onto google drive earlier 
len ratingfive Otherwise this app is great just please fix this bug or whatever it is thanks 
len ratingfive Love this product 
len ratingfive It has become absolutely essential to my business and everyday life 
len ratingone I love that you can create anything inside of google docs and have it so nicely organized GOOD JOB GOOGLE 
len ratingfour I love google drive and use it all the time 
len ratingfour But if you re using it on a phone or iPad you also have to download google docs 
len ratingfive I am very glad that I took the time to checkout 
len ratingfive I truly like it 
len ratingtwo Not easy to navigate and to find files
len ratingone Do it 
len ratingone I would give it stars but I downloaded the app for one reason and it isn t working 
len ratingone I wanted to move the videos from my computer to my camera roll 
len ratingone So I downloaded google drive and decided to put the videos on the drive so they would show up in the drive on my phone a iPhone s I heard that to download it to camera roll you have to tap the circles select send copy and click save video 
len ratingone The option to save the video never came up no matter how many times I tried 
len ratingone I turned my phone off reinstalled the app looked everywhere for help and check to make sure everything was updated 
len ratingone I would love to use this but I need help so that is app will be useful please tell me what is happening thanks 
len ratingfive Very useful data likely used though 
len ratingfive But can t live without Google 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Very convenient
len ratingthree  Trying to use the app to see the files shared with me and lo and behold the Shared with Me section is gone currently using an iPhone Don t know if it was ever there or not but I need to get to that section so if y all could please fix that I will gladly appreciate and change my rating

len ratingtwo Takes upwards of weeks before new and updated documents are visible on the Google Drive iOS app 
len ratingtwo MacBook Pro created the file so I don t even need Google Drive to synchronize my files with iCloud 
len ratingtwo It s a convenience thing but you definitely won t get a seamless storage solution out of Google Drive 
len ratingfive It allows me to do a lot of things like I would on a computer 
len ratingfive Great

len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive ever since my school started the google certification program in th grade 
len ratingfive I very recently made a personalized email apart from my school email 
len ratingfive While I had school files and folders I also enjoy writing and had many folders full of projects and work 
len ratingfive While I thought it would be impossible to transfer all this over to my new email fast I was wrong 
len ratingfive Google made it so easy for me to transfer and organize my data would recommend to friends
len ratingfive This is a excellent application 
len ratingfive Thank you many blessings 
len ratingfive Love using it very convenient uploading files and I enjoy that part 
len ratingone Nags me for a review so here is my one star review 
len ratingone  Freezes and stutters 
len ratingone That virtually never happens to me on other iPad apps 
len ratingfive I can use this to store my google presentations docs spreadsheets etc 
len ratingfive Good for streamlining the photo sharing process for a businesses social media that I m working on 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone Never fully expunged trash and keeps adding back so run out of storage then wants you to buy more and can t get gmail 
len ratingone U guys need to simplify the sharing process 
len ratingone To many times people send me files and when I open it says I need permission someone has been sending me a file now for minutes 
len ratingone And it isn t working 
len ratingone With drop box it s simple u choose copy link and send the link and it s done 
len ratingone With you guys it s like u need a White House security clearance to get a music file from a co worker 
len ratingone You need to streamline this process 
len ratingone Come on Google 
len ratingone The app keeps crashing when uploading photos of small size 
len ratingone That does not bode well for a company that is supposedly a bleeding age of technology 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Excellent instrument to create a quiz and other thinks 
len ratingfive For me the best creative app have a friendly mode and versatility options 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Hasta ahora todo marcha excelente puedo aliviar el uso de memoria en mi tel fono y ademas los archivos suben s per r pido
len ratingfive I want to give my testimony memories have been sorted here for ages 
len ratingfive I don t plan to stop using google drive because of this m 
len ratingfive Things that seemed eternal can be sorted here 
len ratingfive Amazing things happen at google when I started working on code I never thought it would be possible 
len ratingfive Now it is so I give it stars 
len ratingfive User friendly 
len ratingfour I was Running out of space on my phone and my brother told me that I could see stuff on my drive so that it wouldn t go on iCloud and get lost it is very useful if you re runningOuter space and you don t know where to put it all you have to do is enter the app and then hit the plus button on the bottom right corner are then going to camera roll or whatever you want to upload and add it and there you go 
len ratingfour You don t have to worry about losing stuff anymore as long as you know how to get into your drive
len ratingfive Google Drive is really bad at saving photos now and doesn t even let you on mine 
len ratingfive It s sad bc that was what I used to put all my photos on and would share them 
len ratingfive Great App to download and upload
len ratingfive This application is so helpful and I keeps all of my documents stored when I need them 
len ratingfive I hope you make more applications like this 
len ratingfive Thank you Matthew DiBlasi

len ratingfive The best 
len ratingfive I love this 
len ratingfive I can upload videos and audios onto it and listen to them watch them offline 
len ratingfive No ads and no money needed lol 
len ratingfive As a classroom teacher drive allows me to quickly share files with my students and their parents 
len ratingone I m trying to view projects and documents shared with me and I can t spend more than seconds in the app before it quits and I have to start all over again
len ratingone I ve severely regretted using Drive once I found out how impossibly cumbersome and difficult it is to manage storage 
len ratingone Their customer support is extremely weak when I asked for help in reducing my storage 
len ratingone I n fact one guy disinvites me from seeking help by saying exactly that you shouldn t Call us back again now that you know there is no solution except the poor solutions they have for solving memory issues 
len ratingtwo I don t know what is happening with this app 
len ratingtwo It just keeps crashing all the time 
len ratingtwo Google please fix this 
len ratingone Why is it crashing every two minutes as im trying to look at pics 
len ratingone  tech 
len ratingone Hire talent not degrees
len ratingone Downloaded this app thinking it was a gps 
len ratingone Imagine my surprise when I realized it was for creating documents and storing data 
len ratingone Why would a truck driver need to make documents 
len ratingfour You should be able to swipe and delete your projects
len ratingfive  This is excellent but would recommend better music player support for personal and business use 
len ratingfive My files aren t playing or takes a long time to upload 
len ratingfive Also should have a repeat option for auto play use 
len ratingfive MORE FRIENDLY FOR US MUSIC PRODUCERS
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive  bugs
len ratingthree Processing time on Videos is so random 
len ratingthree Been waiting for hours for a short video and internet connection is good 
len ratingfive  Stars
len ratingfive Would like to just have a simple cloud that everything can go to without it being a hassle
len ratingone  This is dog shittyyyyy
len ratingfour I can do what ever on here 
len ratingfour I can edit stuff to 
len ratingfour It just need to do A bit more better
len ratingfive excellent hundred percent
len ratingfive For planning
len ratingfive It always works 
len ratingfive Nuff said
len ratingfive Being able to pull up all of my work anywhere at anytime is a relief 
len ratingfive Fast upload times and generous storage 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Many limitations you can point at iPhone iPad as the cause 
len ratingfive Companion apps also not always great 
len ratingfive This app however is great 
len ratingfive Video playback may even surprise you 
len ratingone Can t open anything
len ratingone I couldn t find any of my saved photos through this app 
len ratingone Showed me there were zero photos saved 
len ratingone Had a heart attack 
len ratingone Somehow I accessed google drive directly from internet and there they were 
len ratingone Have no idea what this stupid app is for
len ratingone Despacito Sang By Danny Devito
len ratingfive Google Drive has been soooooo helpful 
len ratingfive My school uses it all the time 
len ratingfive I use it at home all the time to finish my work 
len ratingfive Thank you Google Drive 
len ratingfour  I love this app especially since I can store my images videos in it but there s one issue I m dealing with 
len ratingfour The app sometimes crashes or bugs out if I upload images or more at a time I want to upload all my images at once instead doing some at a time 
len ratingone Should be able to save pdf to a picture And send after typing
len ratingfive I use Google Drove and Docs multiple times a day 
len ratingfive It allows me to have access on the desktops I use in different locations my laptop my phone and the rare times I have to use a public computer 
len ratingfive I love the flexibility it affords me 
len ratingfour So far so good doing VERY SIMPLE tasks 
len ratingone Bring back google plus if you can t fix a bug people shouldn t buy your phones if you can t even fix and f ing privacy bug
len ratingfour I think this apps must be need password system 
len ratingone  I use drive all the time for school photography but for whatever reason the app gets super buggy when you re trying to do stuff on it for a while 
len ratingone To prevent this I just close it reopen it a lot but it gets annoying
len ratingone This not comparable to Dropbox 
len ratingone Do not be fooled 
len ratingfive Super great
len ratingfive I use this both to upload photos and to share contracts with clients 
len ratingfive It is very helpful with my photography and giving me another place to quickly access my work
len ratingfive I do enjoy how I m able to saved my doc s w o the hassle of upload to a thumb drive but what d I really know says the university graduate 
len ratingfive Google drive is easy and fast nice application
len ratingtwo There must ve been an update because my Google Drive app is constantly force closing and it s frustrating 
len ratingtwo Please fix this for iOS devices 
len ratingtwo It s doing it on my iPhone XS Max and my iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo This wasn t an issue before 
len ratingfive It s is very helpful to me and my schoolwork Good job
len ratingfive I will pass my exam
len ratingfive drive is was and probably will continue to be great
len ratingfive gh
len ratingfive A Must Have 
len ratingfive Can t do without it
len ratingone  new update is awful unresponsive and laggy

len ratingone Stuck 
len ratingfive Luv it
len ratingthree After I download a book I can t change the size of the font and the book does not go back to the last page read after I shut my iPad down 
len ratingfive I always used to buy movies but now thanks to google drive I can access to movies without having to buy them
len ratingfive I love Google Drive above all else for the simple fact it works 
len ratingfive I use others such as Dropbox OneDrive Box and have encountered one challenge or another but with Drive it has always been a breeze 
len ratingfive I use an iPhone but before an Android and I had even considered getting a Pixel but Drive works on my iPhone without a fuss 
len ratingtwo i love this app but i have super important videos that i really need to upload and it wont let me 
len ratingtwo some of these videos are insanely short and it still wont upload 
len ratingtwo ive been trying to see why this wont work but i keep coming to a dead end 
len ratingtwo please fix your app or something because i would like to save these videos instead of losing them permanently 
len ratingfive Hi I am a student at fams and I love u
len ratingfour On your phone you have to download all the apps but other then that perfect
len ratingfour I would love if it was easier to upload photos from drive into another platform 
len ratingfour It was pretty hard to do it saying I got prizes for being great at handling technology 
len ratingfive Love it for music files
len ratingfive It s good
len ratingone The autosave feature doesn t work consistently 
len ratingfive Very very wonderful 
len ratingfive It is so easy to organize my albums 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive its awesome
len ratingtwo This app needs to be faster and reliable
len ratingone Why am getting spammed with nudity and ads from Google Drive 
len ratingone Make it stop 
len ratingfive Helpful
len ratingfive I strongly recommend google drive for everyone i ask google to add a passcode on the drive app 
len ratingfive It is great 
len ratingfive I don t know what I d do without Google Drive 
len ratingfive All my school and work info are all stored on one platform which is super easy to access when needed 
len ratingfive Highly recommend for writing papers and storing info
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone I can access my files on my laptop but not my phone 
len ratingone What gives 
len ratingtwo I m glad to have all of my photos backed up somewhere but it s frustrating that the app constantly crashes every minutes or less when all I m doing is looking through my pictures 
len ratingthree  I use this at school and it s very easy to use but it is not very protected because one time someone got into my account and deleted something important and I didn t know what to do after that 
len ratingfive Es una muy conveniente aplicaci n
len ratingone It could be me but there is no sound
len ratingone I am not getting help in converting the form to a fillable one
len ratingfive I love drive 
len ratingfive It helps me organize all of my stuff for school and for home 
len ratingfive I mean 
len ratingone Cannot upload all photos
len ratingfive ITS GOOGLE 
len ratingfive Google is always great when they make apps or sites they work so good and when a bug comes up its fixed so quick Thanks Google
len ratingtwo After trying to update and reload app issues have persisted for months 
len ratingtwo Some days it works fine I but most of the time playback for videos crashes and the app fails to load images 
len ratingtwo Very unreliable even after purchasing extra drive space 
len ratingtwo Using iPhone XS Max All OS and app software up to date 
len ratingtwo Issues also persist on desktop 
len ratingone Crap
len ratingfive Im a user since Gmail Beta needed pre approval 
len ratingfive I like Google apps 
len ratingfive I enjoy using drive to remind me of everything wherever I go cause I can use it on my phone or taplet or my computer when I m at home
len ratingfive Very good app
len ratingone The Home section page in the IOS app is useless and I don t see a way to change it s layout in the app 
len ratingone All it does is show recently viewed files in thumbnail form 
len ratingone Which is kind of a privacy rub as well 
len ratingone The Files section will at least let me select Thumbnail or List view however the list view is almost as worthless as the thumbnails in that the list tells you only the date the file was modified no file size etc and each line takes up nearly as much space as the thumbnails 
len ratingone I ve seen comments saying you can turn off Home s recent view settings and other settings using an actual browser 
len ratingone Well that browser apparently isn t Chrome in iOS cause I don t seem to be able to find a settings menu in the iOS Chrome browser 
len ratingone Safari in iOS at least allows me a bit more Google Account info but not the settings I am told exist 
len ratingone My next step will be to try to change the settings using an actual desktop computer 
len ratingone I don t have high hopes 
len ratingone IMO the app is getting worse 
len ratingone It seems to be made to appeal to people who have the simplest case usage of I want a big bucket to throw files into and view them as thumbnails and I have plenty of time to waste waiting for thumbnails to load This UI is like a Hello World Project that never really got beyond the proof of concept phase of development 
len ratingone I would love to be able to show someone a photo in drive occasionally 
len ratingone But no one has the patience to wait to minutes for the thumbnails to load so that one can be chosen 
len ratingone IOS is rather limited in the way one can save transfer and access files natively 
len ratingone Google drive COULD be a viable solution for people who want to get away from a traditional laptop desktop and do more actual productive WORK on their iOS device 
len ratingone Instead Drive is a last resort 
len ratingone Software for this app needs to be brought to speed with the latest technologies 
len ratingone Options for play share and copying items outright without access to my account is totally out of scope 
len ratingone Ability to play music on my drive on other devices through Bluetooth has always been futile 
len ratingone Generally and overall this software is quite cumbersome and not user friendly as options should be easy and basic reads to comprehend 
len ratingtwo We hate being forced to use tools that are harder to use and don t sort correctly 
len ratingone All I want to do is add these photos to my phone computer and simply can t figure it out 
len ratingone NOT user friendly 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingone  I found out after using G Drive for item s I didn t want to Lose 
len ratingone Since Earlier this year by Accident I Found out from Google that Any Data you ve Deleted that anything you or anybody else with access to your Google Account uploaded to the Drive 
len ratingone The Data is kept on their Databanks for an Unlimited Amount of time 
len ratingone Meaning possibly forever 
len ratingone They could not specify exactly when they purge old deleted DATA from the Servers 
len ratingone They also told me ANY INFORMATION TIED TO YOUR Google Account Google Drive and EVERYTHING ELSE Could be kept in their Databanks even after you Stop using your Google Account Google offers instructions on how to clear up and Supposedly Delete All Data from that Account 
len ratingone When you don t want to use the Account anymore 
len ratingone But I was informed from Google that even than that Data can Stay in their DATABANKS forever 
len ratingone SO PLEASE DON T think Google or anybody else is your friend 
len ratingone Anything tied to your Computer Usage no mater if it s on a Public Library PC or at school or work 
len ratingone ANYWHERE if you want the Data to stay PERSONAL don t Trust Any Company Etc 
len ratingone Your only safe guard is to Encrypt the Data before you enter it anywhere with some sort of Encryption Software Hardware 
len ratingone Even than it s possible that some Mathematicians working with Super Computers employed by Whoever possibly can break the Encryptions As said earlier Encrypted Data is Basically Safe unless you ve done something like Embessiled Millions of from Fort knock or you ve been found out to be a Spy for China Etc 
len ratingone If you don t fit into anything like them examples you are pretty safe using any Encryption Software and or Device 
len ratingone I bought and use a Encrypted Keyboard that is from Microsoft only 
len ratingone Being from Microsoft I wonder if even using that my Data is still only known to me 
len ratingone It probably is because if it was found out that the Encrypted Keyboard still had a BACKDOOR that Microsoft could access the data from the Encrypted Keyboard they sold you They could be SUED for Millions of Dollars 
len ratingone Sometimes searching files take too long 
len ratingone Unable reading the doc files
len ratingfive This is truly great
len ratingone Unsupported file format zip 
len ratingtwo I don t like that app jumps to docs when retrieving a file in the actual google drive
len ratingfive Works perfectly 
len ratingfive Never had a problem 
len ratingfive Used it for years 
len ratingfive I use Google Docs I m general as a literal harddrive for all my devices for backups and it does an amazing job of keeping all my info safe and I m really happy to use Google Docs on app and the computer 
len ratingone  Since I have been digging I am gonna show you a situation AT hand ED
len ratingone Used to tap and see contents of whole file 
len ratingone Now 
len ratingone Where the heck are they 
len ratingone No download feature
len ratingtwo Confusing
len ratingfive This has to be the best cloud app ever
len ratingthree You just asked me to rate the app when it froze on me 
len ratingthree But when it s not freezing on me it works well 
len ratingfive I Love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I am using it for a long time with a comfortable mood 
len ratingtwo I love Google Drive on the web and on the desktop but the iOS app is practically unusable for a few reasons 
len ratingtwo Team Drives don t sync they just spin and spin 
len ratingtwo Also no universal search capability within the iOS app that also searches Team Drives Google was built on search 
len ratingtwo I have resorted to recommending my team members bookmark the mobile site instead of using the app because it works better 
len ratingtwo So sad 
len ratingtwo I would love to help fix it 
len ratingtwo  WhzezAu h
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive But clunky until you figure it out 
len ratingfive Add a password for the app please 
len ratingfour Thanks n
len ratingfive Great easy to use 
len ratingfive Kudos to Google
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Wonderful
len ratingfive  I can save anything to google docs and access it later when loggin into my email 
len ratingfive BEST THING EVER 
len ratingfive to save a screenshot password resume 
len ratingfive Google is the best because I upload everything and I show everyone every place I ve been to 
len ratingfive Their is a problem google is slow 
len ratingfive It s annoying 
len ratingthree Awesome except there s no point in having it because you can t edit anything 
len ratingthree It ll be easier just to get Google Docs or Google Slides instead of viewing stuff 
len ratingthree If yo like view only GREAT APP 
len ratingthree If you like editing TRY GOOGLE DOCS OR SLIDES 
len ratingfive Everything in one 
len ratingfive This is perfect for work and assignments 
len ratingfive I personally love this because Google has the documents and assignments to auto save 
len ratingfive You just got to love Google 
len ratingfive Saves alot of information for ever 
len ratingtwo I love the app and where always keep my pictures and documents from school but I recently tried to download a picture and it there s no option that allows me to do so 
len ratingtwo My brother has the old version and his has the download option why was that taken away 
len ratingone It is lame
len ratingthree This app has so many good reviews I feel like they won t even read mine but a few things I will critique Could you bring back passcode lock 
len ratingthree  Can we have a scrollbar 
len ratingthree  The new way our folders files pictures look makes it hard to see with the mobile app 
len ratingthree The thumbnails became smaller for photos when the display changed 
len ratingone Why even have this app it s not user friendly 
len ratingone Why is the layout different from desktop app 
len ratingone When I make new folders on desktop I can no longer find them on mobile for some reason 
len ratingfive I wouldn t get anything done if it didn t exist 
len ratingfive Absolutely love how user friendly the app is as well as how it is interactive 
len ratingone  Star 
len ratingone Ive been trying to figure out how to download a video for so long but NOTHING works 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingthree  I am not able to get documents from drive on Apple Xr when trying to use documents 
len ratingfive Thank you for giving us all the tools to collaborate thrive and share 
len ratingfive DYGI 
len ratingfive Did you 
len ratingfive It helps you get what you need done
len ratingfive I have been a long time user of Google products 
len ratingfive Over the past years I have seen improvements in Leaps and bounds especially when it comes to integration of other services 
len ratingfive I am an apple fan boy but am considering taking the complete Google plunge 
len ratingfive Amazing app never had an issue with it 
len ratingfive Wish there was a simple button one could push to automatically sync your device to google drive 
len ratingfive Or to update files if they for whatever reason don t get automatically synced
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive  Google drive it increases productivity and helps to keep everything organized
len ratingfive great 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It s make everything so much easier
len ratingone It crashes every 
len ratingone single 
len ratingone time I try to use 
len ratingthree It s not up to date 
len ratingfour  Whenever I download a Google Drive music clip and save it to files it makes weird glitchy sounds 
len ratingfour Please fix this and thanks 
len ratingfour  Does not support the lock feature 
len ratingfour One of the biggest drawbacks 
len ratingfive It s so much useful 
len ratingfive this ap is very useful because it can help me organize my things and share with my class 
len ratingone Needs lots of improvement
len ratingfive Google is THEE best for this app 
len ratingthree Some files names containing Chinese characters are still unable to be indexed 
len ratingfive Weshnaw
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It s simple to use 
len ratingfive The best device for listening to stored music etc
len ratingone I can t figure out how to delete shared files really irritating that I keep getting sent nudes 
len ratingfour I think this is an an awesome app but I only gave it a four star because there is no way to lock the app with a passcode I have an apple device 
len ratingfive The Drive has given our staff the ability to get work done even when we are not in the office 
len ratingfive Our executive staff has full permissions to the documents we can see who has looked at the documents and who has made any changes 
len ratingfive Sometimes we are at different locations but we can look at documents and discuss their status as long we have our phones or any computer 
len ratingfive This creates time for us to visit our other buildings meet with managers or take care of personal errands 
len ratingfive In addition we can look at large files which sometimes are rejected by email 
len ratingfive Right now I am getting my car worked on while Writing a contract and others are helping to edit 
len ratingfive Awesome Technology 
len ratingone The app was good this update removing the traditional file system is not 
len ratingone Folders exist for a reason 
len ratingone So I don t have to use the search bar to see what I m trying to find 
len ratingone I don t see why you guys had to ruin that 
len ratingfive This app is a great storage place for all your files 
len ratingthree The google drive doesn t upload videos
len ratingfive Excelente app se pueden guardar los datos con mucha facilidad y seguridad 
len ratingfour Edwin to the rescue thank you for your help today you have single handedly brought silence back to our home 
len ratingfive  Dubbu dubbu dubbu
len ratingfive Good for a quick jam That s about it Don t have a computer 
len ratingfive Close enough
len ratingfive This app has really helped in terms of school and other things 
len ratingfive I was able to locate all my file easily and everything was organized with this app 
len ratingfive I love to use it for my projects 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and it has everything you need
len ratingfive Ugh pejenenemejenekjeejsjsjsjsjjsjssjyfcoyszzo ptStpsyzoszwIwiaWr

len ratingfive Google Drive is the best 
len ratingfive Makes things so convenient to always have what I need at my finger tips 
len ratingone  horr vel de estar mexendo
len ratingone After the update I can no longer find files shared with me 
len ratingone I use this for my job and I need the files on my phone 
len ratingone It see to be super easy to find my files and now I spend several minutes to find them or just like now have up 
len ratingone Super disappointed since the update 
len ratingone F to the U C K this App
len ratingfive I like it but eh
len ratingfive Thanks again
len ratingone One of your best features password protection has been taken from your service 
len ratingone It s obvious that Google has absolutely no regard whatsoever for their customers or their privacy but at least you fake it well sometimes 
len ratingone It crashes every time with newest iPad and iPhone scrolling through photos 
len ratingfive Hi 
len ratingfive I keep all my important documents here 
len ratingfive My daughter helped set me up with google 
len ratingfive I ve gone paperless at home and everything is on my laptop 
len ratingfive Now with google it s on my iPhone too 
len ratingfive Amazing I love it 
len ratingtwo  Recently the Google Drive Keep Crashing It just unable to read my files listing have to Shutdown and Reopen the Apps Times Til it proper read my files listing
len ratingthree Takes awhile to sync with other devices 
len ratingthree Doesn t give as much info on the file as desktop does 
len ratingfive I love being able to do papers for school or work and having access no matter what 
len ratingfive I also back up my photos here so when my phone died I still had the important ones 
len ratingfive I am the worst on any tech stuff an even I can figure out Google drive 
len ratingfive Drive is really useful for me 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Got no complaints
len ratingfive Google Apps are so easy to use and efficient for organizing data 
len ratingfive Tr s bon
len ratingfive What s better than google drive and the tools on the drive 
len ratingfive Well nothing is better in the area 
len ratingfive Thank you for the amazing software for collaboration 
len ratingfive I love Google drive and the app 
len ratingtwo How this can be useful if the app uses a safari or chrome webpage to see your google forms 
len ratingtwo I wanted to add collaborators to my google form to edit it and it literally won t let me scroll down 
len ratingtwo I can see my documents that s all 
len ratingfive Easy to use protected 
len ratingone It takes forever to open a PDF on my IPhone 
len ratingone BTW a have a very fast WIFi connection 
len ratingfour Makes uploading pictures and videos a hella lot easier when I m sending them to a teacher and the file is too long 
len ratingfive E
len ratingone  I don t understand how ios drive has such a high rating 
len ratingone There are just so many major bugs that have been present in the app for years 
len ratingone bugs which have affected my usage across various iPhones and iPads ie it s not the device ios 
len ratingone Other friends also in the tech field echo the same bugs and frustrations with drive as i 
len ratingone For example One of the biggest uploading more than about pictures always results in app freezing at the processing uploads pop up or the app crashes 
len ratingone there is no way to navigate to the parent folder anywhere in the app i e 
len ratingone the linux equivalent of cd when searching for a document there is no way to either see or navigate to the folder that contains that document 
len ratingone for some reason they added the ability to drag files around but there s no way to use that functionality as you can t drag a file into a folder 
len ratingone  Search needs to be improved if I search esx a file or folder with the name esxi should come up you can drag a file your folder around the screen but there is nothing you can do when dragging ie no actions 
len ratingone This needs to be addressed Google need to start providing details in the App Store version history saying bug fixes and performance improvements for literally every single update is on acceptable 
len ratingfive  So this app is amazing 
len ratingfive I used it especially when I was in my school musical and I needed the dance videos and the music to practice 
len ratingfive I just think it is a little slow sometimes but other than that I love this app and suggest it 
len ratingone  The app keeps crashing on iPhone and iPad ios 
len ratingfive  The more in that tag line is that you get your stuff every where without carrying them 
len ratingfive No hassle no haggle 
len ratingfive  Google maps
len ratingfive The ease of use for pretty much all the google apps is awesome 
len ratingfive Accessing things where ever I am and on any device is a piece of mind I love having 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Team 
len ratingfive Just awsome I really appreciate 
len ratingfive Soy fot grafo free lance 
len ratingfive Me gusta mucho porque puedo tener todos mis archivos como documentos personales fotos presets software etc 
len ratingthree Every time I try to have a preview of my slides the screen goes white and can t see anything 
len ratingthree Please fix that 
len ratingfive Great stiff
len ratingfive My mom took my Vbux and I wanted the new John Wick skin in fortnight you can add my epic in gift me it pls Parallel Dove
len ratingfive It s fast and easy 
len ratingfive It would be great to have a passcode to keep all your data safe
len ratingfive Works as it is supposed to 
len ratingfive No errors 
len ratingfive Good for writing stories Try it 
len ratingone Not able to download multiple files
len ratingfive This great for sending large files 
len ratingfive There are times when I need to send a video file to a customer 
len ratingfive This format is easy to use even for someone my age Once I got the hang of it 
len ratingone It keeps asking for a review
len ratingfive It is easy to save or retrieve files from any device or from anywhere
len ratingfive Love that I can open the app chose take photo option 
len ratingfive I copy daily to do lists other docs I may need during the day 
len ratingfive Right there on my phone im a FAN 
len ratingone  Absolute trash 
len ratingone One of the worst apps I ve ever used can t edit a thing on this crap and the navigation is atrocious 
len ratingone Can t download bulk images making this app completely useless 
len ratingone Would not recommend 
len ratingfive The ability to share and store is awesome 
len ratingfive The young men did a wonderful job sharing their gifts with students and inspiring them to follow their musical journey 
len ratingfive Calvin Stemley
len ratingfour Me importa que Drive tenga clave cuando me vaya a entrar en mi archivo antes tenia pero ahora le eliminaron 
len ratingfour Gracias
len ratingtwo I have tried to use this app numerous times for school but whenever I use the app on my phone or iPad it always crashes while I m in a document 
len ratingfive  This app is amazing because it has acorns
len ratingone This thing needs a brief tutorial 
len ratingone I can t figure out how to send to a different account upload or anything 
len ratingone For some reason I can t open old pdf files that I have downloaded 
len ratingone I really dislike this newest iteration of Drive for my iPhone 
len ratingone I may be an odd duck and I like being able to see what I ve got in storage 
len ratingone This newest iteration refuses to show me what I ve got on every occasion when I open it 
len ratingone It shows ONLY the most recent files 
len ratingone And it requires a good bit of cajoling to show me other folders or files that I may need to access Now 
len ratingone It does this Every 
len ratingone Single 
len ratingone Time 
len ratingone I work across several platforms 
len ratingone On two out of three the loss of the ability to see and easily move around through all files and folders in storage remains 
len ratingone Only this recent iOS version does this 
len ratingone It is annoying enough to bring me to contemplate moving all my cloud storage Elsewhere 
len ratingone Color me Discontented 
len ratingfive I like Goggle Drive because it stores all your projects and stuff and if you delete something on accident you can go to a trash bin folder and get it back I would rate Google Drive 
len ratingfour When saving files as iam or other intricate AutoCAD files Google drive saves them different then they actually were 
len ratingfour So when trying to open certain files they won t open because google changes the properties of the auto CAD files saved to the drive 
len ratingone I cannot open word documents anymore because it seems google drive set itself to be the default app for docx files but it does not open them properly
len ratingfive Google Drive offers the storage I need to access pictures and important documents to provide better service to my sellers and buyers 
len ratingfive This is one of the most useful platforms for my life 
len ratingfive Great app and it help my access my file anywhere 
len ratingfive Very helpful for students and people in general it s essential for my daily basis the amount of free space that Google provides its enough 
len ratingfive Ijtifnfifmfi
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive Really enjoy google docs 
len ratingfive Super easy to pull up on my phone 
len ratingfive Easy for a simply grocery list of a school papers highly recommend 
len ratingfive Great app to use saving all my pics and music 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive  Stars 
len ratingfive We Stan
len ratingfive Very easy to use Google Drive 
len ratingfive Must have for anyone looking to have files at their fingertips 
len ratingtwo The new organization does not make sense 
len ratingfive This is the best app
len ratingfive es la expresi n misma de lo maravillosamente extraordinario y excelente
len ratingfive This is an excellent little video on my most favorite way to pray 
len ratingfive As a cradle Catholic I have always loved praying the Rosary however I did not know the history of the Rosary 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone I just saved several memos in Russian from my phone to this drive 
len ratingone When I went to open a file the Cyrillic was lost 
len ratingthree Scrolling some photos the app shuts down
len ratingfive Love 
len ratingfive For work or personal it s amazing 
len ratingfive Great for business functionality and work flow management 
len ratingfive Easy and updates often 
len ratingtwo I have tried twice it says preparing and nothing happens 
len ratingtwo It is frustrating selecting all photos try to upload not even retry no feedback from application 
len ratingfive This is awesome bro thanks dude no cap
len ratingfive great app to save all doc 
len ratingone Could handle multiple photo upload
len ratingfive Drive on a mobile device is great 
len ratingfive Of course it may be a little laggy or slow but it s works perfect 
len ratingfive You can t do certain things that you would be able to do on your computer though 
len ratingfive  Ssdhdhddhgdyebddhw
len ratingfive  Love that I can access my Drive on my phone 
len ratingfive Makes my life so convenient 
len ratingone  My inbox on drive is continuously being filled with spam porn I need it to stop 
len ratingfive Busted stuff
len ratingfive It s pretty good 
len ratingone App keeps crashing after this update
len ratingone I ve never had a problem before but since the last update the app keeps crashing every time I try to view my files
len ratingfive It s a cool apps
len ratingone This is absurd 
len ratingone Expected more from Google 
len ratingone I have a folder on iCloud with files 
len ratingone Why should I have to upload them one by one 
len ratingone Other cloud services dropbox for example allow uploads of multiple files 
len ratingone Doing this through the Files app doesn t work either 
len ratingone Fix this to be usable
len ratingfive Ease of use
len ratingone Takes really long to load some pictures and videos sometimes they won t even load at all so I can t see what I have saved 
len ratingone I don t have an option to download any content from this app 
len ratingfive Google Drive is KiNG
len ratingfour I absolutely love google drive 
len ratingfour I can see all my stuff and it really helps me with my school work 
len ratingfour But there is one problem 
len ratingfour This app just shows you your stuff on google drive 
len ratingfour You have to download other apps to actually edit them 
len ratingfour Well that s my review 
len ratingone App ran perfectly since install years ago 
len ratingone Last week s update causes constant folders not found and upon refresh they appear but then crashes during folder browse 
len ratingfive Love having google drive as an application on my phone it make my life x easier 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive Google i love you you are n in whole world 
len ratingfour Google docs is free to use what s to lose 
len ratingfour Has helped me with my school projects for the longest 
len ratingfour I regularly learn more about its features and am glad to have it 
len ratingfour Thanks google
len ratingone Trying to look at photos on my phone and keep getting kicked out 
len ratingone Literally times in minutes 
len ratingfive Loved the German pastry chef 
len ratingone Won t let me edit on my iPhone 
len ratingone That didn t use to be a problem 
len ratingone Worthless liberal censorship trash 
len ratingfive Great app for school or work 
len ratingfive It s also fun to mess around with it 
len ratingfive The difference with google drive on the Apple phones and computers is that on the computer your drive login is the login for the other stuff like docs slides classroom but on the phone you have to download them 
len ratingfive But in all honesty google forever 
len ratingfive  I don t know 
len ratingfive Wouldn t know where I would be with out this app 
len ratingfive Makes life livable 
len ratingfive Outstanding work Google 
len ratingfive A highly recommended app 
len ratingthree Maybe it s because I ve always used Corporate files but I get confused between One Drive and Google Docs 
len ratingone See subject
len ratingone Very hard to use
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingfive It s so amazing 
len ratingfive I just finished the most arduous nursing school and I used Drive everyday and ever moment 
len ratingfive I saved all my study materials and homework on the drive so I can access it from anywhere 
len ratingfive All my changes are saved and even if my computer quits Drive saves it always 
len ratingfive I was also able to share documents and work on it with classmates on projects 
len ratingfive I can also synchronize my laptop desktop which I can access from the Drive from anywhere 
len ratingfive Google Drive is awesome 
len ratingfive SMA
len ratingfive I ve been an early adopter of google products 
len ratingfive I made my first gmail account in DAGphone 
len ratingfive When it came time to step into the commercial arena and be taken seriously as a young entrepreneurial American spirit google was the natural choice 
len ratingfive Of course I miss Google Wave but I was ahead of its time and that can be quixotic for entrenched industry professionals 
len ratingfive The G Suite is the only tool necessary to get things done 
len ratingfive Including petition SCOTUS 
len ratingone I classified everything in different folder now everything mess up 
len ratingone The last update was the worse update for this app 
len ratingfive It s
len ratingone What kind of mentally chanllenged person puts the delete button right next to the download button 
len ratingone And then if you accidentally press the delete button theres no window that pops up saying are you sure you want to delete gb worth of videos Nope IT JUST INSTANTLY DELETES IT ALL 
len ratingone VANISHED 
len ratingone And is it in the trash folder now where i can recover it back 
len ratingone NOPE 
len ratingone  GB OF VIDEOS THAT IM BEING PAID TO EDIT IS GONE NOW 
len ratingone THANKS GOOGLE 
len ratingone THANKS FOR SCREWING ME 
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive It is a great quality 
len ratingfive Oky
len ratingfive I had photos on a number of devices due to my photography business and it was often problematic trying to keep track of all the photos in my work flow 
len ratingfive Google drive makes it easy to have access to all my photos with all my devices no matter where I m at and without having to carry around multiple portable hard drives 
len ratingone I m on iPad and everything is giant boxes now no list icon a lot more scrolling now in an app that looks like it s designed for a year old 
len ratingone Stop making things worse 
len ratingone Treat your customers like professional adults 
len ratingtwo  It s so hard to export files to other apps that I can t see why else you would even bother having it on your iPad 
len ratingtwo It s USELESS on an apple machine 
len ratingfive Everything could be organized on google drive 
len ratingfive Year after year I run all my labor here 
len ratingfive Thanks Thanks
len ratingone Dropping files from my MacBook Pro randomly show up or don t show up on my ios devices useless crap 
len ratingone It s ok not the best but it s ok
len ratingfive  I use it for school 
len ratingfive We can t take chrome books home which stinks 
len ratingfive Good for stuff 
len ratingfive I don t know I m bored and I m doing homework
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive I am no longer stuck on my desktop computer 
len ratingfive Now i can travel and still have access to all my documents no matter where i go 
len ratingfive Absolutely love Google and how you are able to access this from anywhere
len ratingone S seriamente estaba mejor el dise o anterior ahora es m s complicado subir im genes las im genes nunca se terminan de subir y ya no se puede pausar el proceso 
len ratingone Sinceramente es molesto no poder encontrar nada como antes 
len ratingfour  I love Google Drive but would like it if all my accounts could always be signed in 
len ratingfour And on iPads I d like there to be a way to sign out 
len ratingfive This is a nice way to work without paper waste
len ratingfive This is a really useful cross platform cloud app which makes life much easier 
len ratingfive If you need storage or sharing files this is the app for it pretty much compatible with every system I ve used so far 
len ratingfive Definitely recommend it 
len ratingfive Does what it s supposed to 
len ratingfive Google drive has to be at least in the top of the google apps You can save everything that you need to into folders transfer things into it and so on 
len ratingfive It s a amazing feat of google 
len ratingfive I definitely recommend this 
len ratingone  Garbage like everything google does 
len ratingtwo Notes Google Drive When I open my Google Drive in the folder viewing section when I m on the My Drive folder my files randomly hide themselves from view 
len ratingtwo I have no idea why but when I refresh the page my files come back 
len ratingtwo This happens every time I open this app 
len ratingtwo It started a day after I installed the latest app update 
len ratingtwo Plus at the moment it s only happening on one of my accounts 
len ratingtwo Could this be a bug or glitch in the app or could someone have hacked my account 
len ratingtwo Now I just found out that this happens on the star list too 
len ratingfive Not the best
len ratingfive Been using google drive for over years 
len ratingfive Solid service for all online collaboration 
len ratingone Hey why am I being spammed 
len ratingfive So like the title states this app is Amazing I love it and use it daily the only problem with it is if you want to edit ANY doc and slide you HAVE to buy the other apps Goggle doc slides and pages 
len ratingfive They are all free though what would make this app stars would be being able to edit docs from the google docs app 
len ratingfive  As of now you can only view 
len ratingthree This used to be my GO TO APP when needing to transfer photos from my iPhone to my drive recently it s been very slow and not sure what is going on 
len ratingthree It s take hours for a few pictures to upload and sometimes it even fails at that 
len ratingthree I don t know what happened but it needs to be fixed 
len ratingthree I hate transferring photos via PC and this just make is simple by just laying in bed 
len ratingthree I loved this app and I hope it ll be fixed soon 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work
len ratingfive It s a great app
len ratingone Every time an app asked me to read it when I m trying to use it I give it one star that s a dumb feature
len ratingone Every time I open on my phone it says no connection 
len ratingone No matter where I am if I m on a network or not same thing
len ratingtwo Google prioritizes looks over functionality 
len ratingtwo App is now much harder to navigate 
len ratingfive This is very useful
len ratingfive Es muy buena aplicaci n me sirve para lo que la necesito 
len ratingfive Hi

len ratingfive This system makes operation and Video documents extremely easy 
len ratingone I lost my extra chrome and now I m normal
len ratingthree The latest Google Drive update makes the app much harder to use 
len ratingthree Finding files folders and getting to team drives is much more difficult than before 
len ratingthree Wish I never updated 
len ratingfive It was greattt Very fun Very edukatuonal So kool Veryyy Loved it sooo much and had great time Thanks
len ratingfive Es una satisfacci n tener Respaldado tanta cosa gracias 
len ratingfive Google drive and Docs is the best thing since sliced bread

len ratingtwo Ni que decir en el celular 
len ratingtwo Creo que la privacidad de los archivos es primordial 
len ratingfive  My class can make such fun and funny presentations
len ratingfive I am very happy with everything about google drive

len ratingfive This is great
len ratingone Problem for download
len ratingfive Great quick reference anymore it s not so much agnostics and atheists that I must contend with but the so called Christian who follows wayward or misguided doctrine 
len ratingtwo It is amazing to me the difference in the actual files within Google Drive on my laptop and the Google Drive on this device 
len ratingtwo iPhone s Plus 
len ratingtwo Lots not syncing 
len ratingtwo There are whole folders that are on the laptop app and not on the phone app 
len ratingtwo Wifi is working 
len ratingtwo Settings of iPhone say to allow data and all of that 
len ratingtwo So I go searching for a sync button to force the operation and it doesn t appear to have one 
len ratingtwo I know you can pull down 
len ratingtwo Doesn t seem to work 
len ratingtwo However files are still missing on the phone 
len ratingtwo While I gathered a picture in an email and hence needing to upload it to a certain customer folder the folder is just not there 
len ratingtwo Open Google Drive app and the folder is there 
len ratingtwo Laptop app visible where I created it 
len ratingtwo Mobile app visible but no when I hit the upload button to save this picture to this particular folder 
len ratingtwo As I m scanning the option of customer folders with my eyes I see many new customers folders missing 
len ratingtwo Suggestion increase settings available to users so that they can force schedule these syncs 
len ratingtwo Also check how this iPhone upload icon fetches the info Google Drive 
len ratingtwo It s not working and seems to be a version of the distant past 
len ratingtwo Pretty depressing to leave the office knowing you uploaded stuff your trying to continue your work while traveling and it just won t get done because Google Drive is failing to allow me to add files pics docs from multiple entry points 
len ratingtwo Please help 
len ratingone It s better overall but it s missing the uploading status on the bottom 
len ratingone When I upload a lot of pics at a time to different folders it doesn t tell me what photo it s on and how many left till finished 
len ratingone Crashes a lot during upload to where the photos say retrying but it just tried about times then removes them from list without uploading 
len ratingone Once that starts it does it to all remaining pics left to upload requiring a reinstall of app until the next crash 
len ratingfive I use drive regularly in my job and I have had nothing but great experiences with it

len ratingfive U r soooo trash
len ratingtwo I know it takes a bit to get used to new things 
len ratingtwo But good grief 
len ratingtwo I m smart and tech savvy 
len ratingtwo But this update is killing me 
len ratingtwo Not at all intuitive to add files to folders 
len ratingtwo And why do I need to see a list of my recently added and opened files 
len ratingtwo That s why I organize them into folders so I can find everything quickly or I use the search feature 
len ratingtwo It doesn t look like input was sought from actual users before this update 
len ratingfive Best Cloud Drive Ever
len ratingone Why would I want to see all recent activity in the home screen 
len ratingone At leaset let me choose what s shown like for example my FILE FOLDERS 
len ratingone You can t multiselect files 
len ratingone Is it again 
len ratingfive This is awesome I can write so many story s

len ratingtwo Very difficult to find things with this new update 
len ratingfour Holds my music and documents perfectly 
len ratingfour No lag once it s offline 
len ratingfour Just wish I can add my music files in my library on my iPhone
len ratingone In my opinion this is not good because you need all the other apps so what s the point of this one 
len ratingone Due to that I don t really like it 
len ratingfour This is one of the best Google features but it is confusing to figure out how it works and what uploading and shared 
len ratingfour My pictures always seem to be duplicated too 
len ratingtwo  Can t play videos now and I don t know y
len ratingone Uses up gigs of storage on my phone crashes when I m trying to upload more than photos and freezes and crashes often 
len ratingfive Cannot leave w o this tool 
len ratingfive I use it since their Day 
len ratingtwo You do not allow editing to slides without downloading another apps 
len ratingtwo This takes up space and time and is inconvenient for users 
len ratingtwo Will you please allow access to all forms on Drive without the need for other apps taking up space 
len ratingfive  love it 
len ratingfive Penis
len ratingfive I first got this so I could share projects will my teacher easier but then I realized it can do so much more

len ratingthree Lastly for google drawing could you make it so you could color a shape multiple colors 
len ratingthree Thanks uwu 
len ratingfour I have found this to be a good way for several people to read and return to documents shared by others 
len ratingfour I find the navigation and organization of these documents to be a little confusing and so I don t use this as a primary filing sight 
len ratingfive Like and repost this times for good luck 
len ratingfive I know they label dates but wish it automatically went to date folders when loaded up 
len ratingfive Please respond to this review and let me know how to make a folder again before I load

len ratingfive Makes it easy to navigate through docs 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive Excellent site
len ratingfive Google drive forces you to be organized in such a simple easy way that you don t even realize you re doing it 
len ratingfive The app includes almost everything you could access on a laptop 
len ratingfive I have written entire essays from my phone on google docs because I couldn t afford a laptop on high school 
len ratingfive Once I enrolled in college I finally got one 
len ratingfive And I was astounded at how lovely using my touchscreen in Drive is 
len ratingfive It s just perfect for sharing with groups working on projects 
len ratingfive I LOVE GOOGLE DRIVE 
len ratingfive Upload photos organize documents and more helps me so much keeps track of my school work well nothing ever gets lost all I have to say is SO HELPFUL I LOVE IT

len ratingfive Ted talk worthy material 
len ratingfive i love this it lets me save everything that i want to save but it also save my storage from getting full 
len ratingtwo Google drive is great for storing files between a wide variety of devices 
len ratingtwo I can draw on an app on my iPad send it to my phone to remember to post it on all my social media and edit it in Photoshop on my Windows PC 
len ratingtwo Yet Google Drive has slowed recently 
len ratingtwo It crashes when I upload more than images at once 
len ratingtwo It refuses to load videos which are perpetually stuck being still processing 
len ratingtwo I thought this app could help clear some space on my devices but instead I may have just permanently lost some videos and photos that were supposed to have uploaded properly that LOOK as though they should have uploaded properly on the app 
len ratingtwo Yet I cannot access these by any means 
len ratingtwo So long hard work and digitally captured memories 
len ratingtwo I guess that s the price I pay for saving storage 
len ratingfive Excelente aplicacion 
len ratingfive  Gay or straight this app s great
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingthree I wish google let us truly log off our accounts in their apps without having to delete the account each time

len ratingfive You can save any of your files and they never get lost 
len ratingfive Google drive keeps me organized and even helps get an A on a project 
len ratingfive DOWNLOAD THIS APP NOW 
len ratingone This app makes it hard to remove files probably so you max out on storage 
len ratingone Deal breaker for me
len ratingone This app needs dark mode 
len ratingfive Can t survive without this app 
len ratingfive I use it daily as it effortlessly transfers all my work between various devices 
len ratingfive Even long winded videos 
len ratingfour Google drives is amazing 
len ratingfour But there are some add ons I think should be added 
len ratingfour Google Forums 
len ratingfour Forums can still be accessed on the phone but it s not a app so internet is required to open it so I would recommend adding forums 
len ratingfour Thanks muches 
len ratingfive Great ways to share multiple multimedia files at once 
len ratingfive I ve been using google drive all of high school and college 
len ratingfive Much more convenient that MS Word and I can access it almost anywhere 
len ratingfive Highly recommend for everyone 
len ratingtwo This app was easy to use before the most recent update 
len ratingtwo I was able to classify my files into folders but I don t have that option anymore 
len ratingtwo It s harder to find important things now and I m not entirely sure if everything s in the right place 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingfive Hjkh

len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive Keeps all things accessible 
len ratingfive Even my daughter uses Google Drive for all her school projects 
len ratingone Too difficult to locate items 
len ratingone Feels loose and unorganized 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfour A little challenging navigating around to find how to accomplish some tasks for the uninitiated 
len ratingfour However great way to share samples of video art work 
len ratingfour Remember to copyright 
len ratingfive This application allows me to have customers sign documents without paperwork just fantastic 
len ratingfive Thanks Francisco

len ratingfive Very useful indeed for sharing voicemails 
len ratingfive My privacy has been breached 
len ratingfive Want to delete this 
len ratingfive How 
len ratingfour Need to be able to upload spreadsheet with out loosing settings like protected cells 
len ratingone I do not know how Drive allows porn sites to get my info and send random messages thru file sharing 
len ratingone It needs to stop 
len ratingfive  Like it s go ahead
len ratingfive I love the Functionality of this 
len ratingfive  This is one if not the best storage apps in the world 
len ratingfive There are no limitations to what you upload and everything is free 
len ratingfive Easy to use and share for business and personal use 
len ratingfive And I love this 
len ratingfive Gracias por la gran idea que se les ocurri en crear esta app 
len ratingone This app basically breaks my iPad Pro 
len ratingone Everything is updated but when I try to open any document it basically just has a stroke 
len ratingone I can still use Word as my primary app to open documents but I can t navigate to them and click on them and open documents that way 
len ratingone I can t even bypass Google Drive to open with a different app 
len ratingone I have to use Drive for work and my iPad Pro is my only computer and they are NOT compatible 
len ratingone I will need to install Google Drive to use it then uninstall it when I m done to go about the rest of my business 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone You re Google for god s sake 
len ratingfour Fgffyfyfgygygygygygygy
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingone The app constantly crashes on my iPhone xs 
len ratingone I can t upload photos videos and it freezes frequently 
len ratingone I can t scroll all the way to the bottom when looking through files 
len ratingone The fact that the app support link on the App Store leads to a broken google url basically illustrates how this app works 
len ratingfive I really recommend it especially when you want actual pictures that you made and you need to write an essay 
len ratingtwo  I cannot share folders or files via the Google Drive app on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo It freezes every single time 
len ratingtwo This is a hugely important feature for me as an educator and the big has never been fixed 
len ratingfive Enjoy the easiness
len ratingtwo  Problem I am having with the drive is it does not share equally across all my devices 
len ratingtwo So sometimes it is not very user friendly
len ratingfive It s a great app and very user friendly 
len ratingfive Great app but doesn t work well with videos
len ratingone I hate google drive 
len ratingone That is all 
len ratingfive  Excellent app works great stores your data
len ratingtwo It should be as easy as iClouds and dropbox 
len ratingfive Google Drive is currently the most used app on my iPad computer because of its simplicity and manageability 
len ratingfive  m 
len ratingfive  Error Code Invalid Use of Punctuatio 
len ratingfive  Error Code Invalid Use of Punctuation 
len ratingfive Save files and worry less
len ratingfive Horrible app 
len ratingfive  star
len ratingfive This is a terrific app 
len ratingfive I sure hope that any and every type of web browser company out there makes more of software programs like these just like Google itself hopefully will 
len ratingfour Give me a thousand bucks and I will give you a five star rating
len ratingthree No option to save a pdf file as other
len ratingfive Gooood
len ratingone Sbbszz App
len ratingthree As I said this good app take alot of data on my Ipad ios 
len ratingthree Please make it more effective
len ratingone This Google drive is not at all intuitive and frustrating to get it to work for me
len ratingfive I love this software for it is very reliable 
len ratingthree  This latest update makes no use of an iPad in landscape mode 
len ratingthree  the scrolling stutters even on my iPad Pro the folder organization takes up way too much real estate so it takes too much time to scroll down to your pictures you ve yet to move to folders 
len ratingthree If you switch to list view everything is so small you tell what it is 
len ratingthree Lastly when are they going to separate the sorting of Folders from sorting or Images at root level 
len ratingthree I love Drive but this update creates inconvenience and is just plain awful 
len ratingone  Google drive is a great concept that lets you share files with other people for leasure or for work 
len ratingone Too bad it doesn t work of the time 
len ratingone Whether it locks me out of my account for cryptic reasons or tells me that too many people downloaded this file please wait hours for a file THAT A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE IS SUPPOSED TO DOWNLOAD I always shiver whenever I have to use google drive for a project as it usually doesn t work
len ratingtwo I like being able to drag and drop using the Files app but now this update makes that not work 
len ratingtwo My Files app shows content not available 
len ratingtwo This needs to be fixed because I trust Apple a lot more than I trust Google to open and look up my files
len ratingfive  Nice
len ratingfour Everything about the app is perfect except it needs a drag and drop feature for long press that allows you to pick up a file and drag it to a folder 
len ratingone It s literally harder than it needs to be If i share something with someone I shouldn t have to give them permission to access it
len ratingfive But I have access to my stuff from anywhere and that s what I need 
len ratingfive Take me longer but sure 
len ratingthree The google suite of office products drive docs forms etc 
len ratingthree are not very user friendly but with patience and persistence they get the job done 
len ratingfive Such a great way to share deliver files
len ratingthree I am new at this I feel like I spend any of the extra help but all I know is there was nothing on this page
len ratingfive I can t imagine being without this 
len ratingfive I use it every week 
len ratingfive I put my art on there and have used it to write my book 
len ratingfive Early on I made a mistake 
len ratingfive I didn t realize that Google Docs do not count against my storage space and downloaded them when I was running out of space 
len ratingfive Then I deleted them from The Drive after copying them to a disc 
len ratingfive I recently opened a Google Doc from my disc only to find out it is a link and not what I wrote 
len ratingfive I put the file back on Google Drive but the link does not relink and I still can t read the document 
len ratingfive So do not take your Google Docs off the drive 
len ratingone Hate the new home set up 
len ratingone Don t want to show when and what I last uploaded
len ratingfive Great and easy app I use for school and free writing anything 
len ratingfive  I ve used this app a lot and it works like magic 
len ratingfive It is so easy to make files and slideshows and books 
len ratingfive Google makes life easier 
len ratingfive It is wonderful
len ratingfive Whenever you back up your files to the drive you can pull them down off the cloud with any device that you re signed in on 
len ratingfive  This app is great it organizes your paper into neat folders
len ratingtwo This app will be five stars if you guys brought back password protection 
len ratingtwo I keep a lot of sensitive information on my Google drive and if someone was to get their hands on my phone it could be damaging to me 
len ratingthree Provides bulk storage space but no bulk storage option 
len ratingthree I have photos to back up and Google s instructions are to individually select the photos you want to upload 
len ratingthree Yeah sure Not a complicated feature 
len ratingthree Needs improvement 
len ratingfive Best storage service in the universe 
len ratingone  Is weird I don t think it ll grow on me 
len ratingfive This app helps store al the data I need 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive best app ever 
len ratingfour  Nuf said
len ratingone Please correct me if I m wrong but why can t I seem to password protect Google Drive or any of its subsidiaries Sheets Docs 
len ratingone If someone takes my phone while it a unlocked they can basically open google drive and see all of my company s sensitive information 
len ratingone Where is the same two factor password authentication from Gmail here 
len ratingone export loading takes to long
len ratingone It will not open 
len ratingone Useless 
len ratingfour Me encanta 
len ratingfour  me gustar a tener m s almacenamiento gratis 
len ratingone The update they made makes the files organized in a worse looking way and makes my lose all of my folders
len ratingone Can someone please explain why I need different apps do do what i used to be able to do in safari 
len ratingfive Love everything about The G Suite apps 
len ratingfive Super useful and convenient 
len ratingfive I really enjoy being able to grade on the go using the Google Classroom app 
len ratingfour Love the app but regardless of how many times I change my settings my friends and clients always still have to go through an extra step before they can view anything I share 
len ratingfive  Like it s 
len ratingone  Why create a special google doc format that literally no one or any software recognizes 
len ratingone It s so frustrating when you create a resume and then gotta convert it to a docx just to apply and when it does convert it basically puts all of your work in a blender 
len ratingone I m cleaning out my drive and having to redo almost everything in my drive I d have to actually submit 
len ratingone Thanks a lot google you literally shafted me just to be different 
len ratingtwo Loading from phone requires app to be awake not just open if screen goes dark uploading stops 
len ratingtwo Requires constant maintenance of tapping to keep screen awake 
len ratingtwo Seems like this is fixable 
len ratingfive Excellent product 
len ratingfive We use it everyday Nikrabella com
len ratingfive The fastest most efficient way to work from anywhere 
len ratingfive Finding attaching sending small or large docs and photos is seamless 
len ratingfive Everything I do for work and personal is in my Google Drive 
len ratingfive I loathe paper so it s amazing to have a place to store everything 
len ratingfive All of my spreadsheets are most important because I can easily share them with physicians in my organization 
len ratingfive Google you rock 
len ratingfive Thank you for making my life easier and more organized 
len ratingfive Subscribe to pewdiepie
len ratingone  After taking my personal info Google said it couldn t set up because I needed to delete my cookies on my iPad 
len ratingone iPad erases not just cookies but browsing history as well and I don t want to lose my browsing history 
len ratingfour Herramienta muy til me gustar a tuviese m s capacidad de almacenamiento y simplificaci n de su uso
len ratingone  Deleted all my work f 
len ratingfour Awesome
len ratingfive Let s me store edit share and organize
len ratingone This doesn t work at all 
len ratingone It s not one drive 
len ratingone I guess that sort of sums up my review which was a waste of two minutes 
len ratingfive The spreadsheet and document options work well on Android and iPhone 
len ratingfive It s very convenient that all content is available and editable with several types of devices when on line 
len ratingfive Mi bello pa s venezuela lo extra o
len ratingfour Update the app for iPhone 
len ratingfive I love it so much 
len ratingfive It helps me get all of my important stuff done 
len ratingtwo generally works but i can hardly ever find the files I m looking for sometimes they seem to have completely disappeared from drive even when i can easily access them from my desktop 
len ratingone After this update the app will no longer load any documents I try to open 
len ratingone It s not the internet connection because I am able to use safari and other internet connected apps just fine 
len ratingfive in search the final results are below the screen so u can t actually access them
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Very helpful
len ratingfour I love Google Drive 
len ratingfour It is a very valuable tool 
len ratingfour I use it hourly during the work week 
len ratingfour I am able to jot down an idea on my phone turn it in to a project at home present it at work assign it to my students have them finish it on their computers and grade it all through Google Drive and Google Classroom 
len ratingfour It is impossible for me to forget my thumb drive cd or any other archaic storage device because Google Drive is always there from any of the devices my phones iPads Chrome Books and generic school desktop computer or another business computer 
len ratingfour I rarely have trouble with formatting issues from one computer to another system and if I do it s minor 
len ratingfour Where Google Drive fails a five star in my opinion is organization especially when sharing files 
len ratingfour I have files shared with me that I have no idea what is in them and if I tried to organize all of it someone else could unorganize it 
len ratingfour I rely on the search bar MOST of the time 
len ratingfour But that means I have to remember what I labeled something three years ago 
len ratingfour Then I will likely find something else equally good from a shared file I didn t know existed that could have been used LAST week 
len ratingone It is a great app the inly problem is it can hard to find things 
len ratingone Nope
len ratingfive Great resource
len ratingfive Very helpful when I m in a meeting and I have to check some information from my laptop which I m not carrying 
len ratingfive Google drive saves me from the embarrassment of forgetting about old information 
len ratingone  This is the largest source of knowledge learning and incoming information 
len ratingone We trust Google to give us honest and real answers but they re not 
len ratingone They are purposefully throttling relevant information and searched for information in favor of their communistic views that they would like to push on to the public 
len ratingone This is a dishonest and disingenuous company 
len ratingone They have every right to be that seeing as they are their own company But this is still the free market system and in a free market system companies that practiced dishonest and disingenuous business practices will always lose their shares eventually 
len ratingone Google is just praying that the communists take over first so that they can subsidize their failing company 
len ratingone Not user friendly
len ratingfive It keeps my data organized
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingtwo Apple limited access and hard to work with google earth
len ratingfive Yes there is talk of google as sky net but CIA and FBI infiltration aside they are incredibly reliable and dependable with my photos and I appreciate and need that 
len ratingfive I love making books with my friends and google drive makes it so I can share and work on them out of school 
len ratingfive Nothing compares to Google s Apps for Education 
len ratingfive Not only is it the leader in the industry it s also free 
len ratingfive Thank you developers and the rest of the team for all that you do for the education field 
len ratingfive Very handy and practical 
len ratingfive Available on all my devices where app is installed 
len ratingone I ve been using Google Drive for over years 
len ratingone Periodically entire folders full of important backups will disappear 
len ratingone I ve dealt it with as long as I can 
len ratingone After looking through my files to find some album art I made in not only did I realize the file vanished but so did all my music from 
len ratingone I reorganized the folders recently 
len ratingone I think there might be a bug when you select folders and use right click to move them 
len ratingone In retrospect I think that s how my other ones vanished 
len ratingone Maybe something gets confused on the server side

len ratingtwo Please do a dark mode

len ratingfour Awesome but sometimes it is a bit slow
len ratingfive Handy way to access my documents and media files from my phone 
len ratingtwo  Can t understand why low res images are often downloaded in place of the full image

len ratingtwo Many many people have reported this issue 
len ratingtwo What s wrong Google

len ratingone No other online storage platform has such a thing as video is processing 
len ratingfive Tighter than you thought
len ratingfive  LOVE
len ratingfive Gets the job done not just sometimes but every time 
len ratingone  If you have a large amount of files on your Google drive and find yourself needing to quickly find a specific file 
len ratingone The search filtering option of choosing a file type has been removed 
len ratingone For example you may have files which include photos music videos file types 
len ratingone Instead of being able to search through only audio or video you re forced to look through all files if you can t remember the files name 
len ratingone I have no idea who thought it was useful to remove such an option 
len ratingone Very DISAPPOINTED
len ratingone Help

len ratingfive  It s nice but don t live up to its name and can get people confused sooooo I METTATON THE GLAMOUR STAR 
len ratingfive IG METTATON HAS THE SPOTLIGHT GIVE IT A FIVE STAR RATING
len ratingfive I really like it 
len ratingfive Who ever reads this I hope your day is great 
len ratingfive  I like this app because you can play and have fun you can get free games and take tests at schools And that is why I like google 
len ratingone There should be a global option to make My files availed offline 
len ratingone Not user friendly 
len ratingone Am trying to search shared calendar and it doesn t give an option 
len ratingfive Dis crazy
len ratingfour  I LOVE LOVE this app 
len ratingfour I have never ONCE had any difficulty with it bug failure to open a file anytype of no understanding of instructions or anything other than the kossof resolution as mentioned in the above review which seems to be consistent through out the Applications 
len ratingfour You take a shot you perfect it but that is THE ONLY EXACTLY PERFECT SHOT YOU WILL EVER HAVE 
len ratingfour That s it 
len ratingfour PRAY that you don t inadvertently delete it duplicate it have a friend who really wants to see it which would mean taking a copy and sending it 
len ratingfour You WILL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER PHOTO LIKE THAT ORIGINAL 
len ratingfour I have tried downloading to a stick files archives even this App Google Drive 
len ratingfour And THIS IS MY GO TO APP 
len ratingfour But aside from the great things it does nothing I have found yet can copy or duplicate or even download all your photos from a trip to ANY APP without loosing resolution date time place iOS arpeture etc 
len ratingfour You loose the fine color specs the ID s on the reverse of the print sometimes you even loose the original size rotation color lighting or warm exposure light depth of field etc 
len ratingfour Google Drive I you and you have yet to let me down 
len ratingfour Keep up the awesome work 
len ratingfour Just a suggestion and I don t know what if anything can ever be done with making a copy of an original as even in a dark room it requires incredible work 
len ratingfour To produce an application that can copy and store your awesome photo work in a app like Drive since it doesn t seem to be flawed with a bug yet please please 
len ratingfour Keep the bugs away 
len ratingfour  and when you go to axcess the photos they are just as awesome as they were the day they were taken 
len ratingfour If you should need to make a copy or duplicate to send to a friend or use as a contact or album cover etc 
len ratingfour don t allow the original to be touched in any way 
len ratingfour By size starting to get fuzzy in color or outline sometimes you may even loose a shot when downloading because for 
len ratingfour It hiccups and falters 
len ratingfour You ve counted pictures downloaded but only are there and the missing one is absolutely nowhere to be found 
len ratingfour I STILL don t know where they go 
len ratingfour I ve checked archive movies collages other files as there are google applications 
len ratingfour One for Google photos and another for photos then you have moments then you have camera 
len ratingfour Can we maybe TRY to make all that just a little bit easier and efficient 
len ratingfour Is it really necessary to have that many areas for photos not including any incredibly large archives from applications that they ve decided to get rid of ie G 
len ratingfour Why when I made my archive of it did suddenly G pictures suddenly find themselves on my Facebook main page 
len ratingfour On Google Search along with my pictures and all my private information that was asked for to open the account including my phone number yet wasn t told to me it would go viral when Google decided to get rid of G not long after they published the newly found way to Hack into the application and then allowed it to simply sit until then deciding to get rid of it 
len ratingfour A lot like Facebook did with what started out as a great chat site for families and friends to find each other and connect with other people 
len ratingfour It was great 
len ratingfour Photos were able to be sent and it was all a innocent experiment by a few college kids 
len ratingfour Then came the trollers hackers jealous guys girls fake pictures copied photos that were copy written 
len ratingfour The games got to have nothing further to do they were pointless after seeing how people who didn t know each other joined as a comparable group 
len ratingfour No one understood what the purpose was anymore 
len ratingfour Fake accounts popping up people getting killed children molested prostitution drug trafficking and on it went changed Facebook forever and then it changed ownership and now Google owned it 
len ratingfour No more Hotmail Microsoft Mail browsers that you want to use not that come with the mailbox you choose 
len ratingfour Ads have taken over everything makes no difference if you click on that page list of ads to get or opt out you ll still get them even incognito browsing its the cookies or whatever a particular app wants you to allow them to use on your phone 
len ratingfour What does an application say for instance one having to do with your archive of pictures have to NEED to have axcess to your camera notifications when the phone is locked etc 
len ratingfour I ll stop here I m surprised that I have been able to get this far 
len ratingfour But if you want a app that s clean does its job and does it well 
len ratingfour Google Drive 
len ratingfour Great work 
len ratingfour I like this 
len ratingfour Organized
len ratingone For the Home tab 
len ratingone I don t think it s useful 
len ratingone And by the way I don t like the thing I previously review appear right at the time I open the app 
len ratingone Please make it optional to turn on the Home tab or delete this function 
len ratingone Please
len ratingtwo All of a sudden my g doc closed and I m searching for my composition 
len ratingtwo Totally surprising not a usual circumstance 
len ratingtwo Shutting down apps looking for my stuff and the first thing to prompt me is this review 
len ratingtwo Timing is everything 
len ratingfour This has limits on how many files can be uploaded at time 
len ratingfour This doesn t seem to happen on Android 
len ratingone I want to share photos but can t figure it out
len ratingfive Google Drive keeps everything in order 
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingone On iPhone is hard to upload all albums 
len ratingone  Literally the only thing I need this app for is to download photos to my iOS device that my wife sends me 
len ratingone Conviently enough the only thing it won t do is mass download to camera roll which is the only thing I want it to do 
len ratingone Don t bother with this trash app 
len ratingone Find something else instead 
len ratingone Navigation on drive is slow on iPhone 
len ratingone Sometimes the drive does not respond when tapping icon 
len ratingfour  I like using google docs and google slides 
len ratingfour Djjdjdjdndjskks Ic did mckdnci Cisco s d Mid did isms Mumford Vic 
len ratingfour If Vic Vic m jc can c Vic was the day we got to up tuthe was your birthday party and we were are leaving the house and tthen is your day I was eating lunch and I
len ratingone Why do I need to buy this now 
len ratingfive I like this a lot because I can use it at home or a school this lets kids to be creative and curious with their bright mines 
len ratingfive I would rate this a out of a 
len ratingfive It is so useful in so many ways 
len ratingfive This is perfect for any occasion 
len ratingfive If I had a choice of google drive or a different slide thing or something I would of course choose google drive
len ratingfive My Drive is a great way to save my files and share them with my coworkers
len ratingthree I can t tell how many uploads I have left anymore because there s no number
len ratingfive I started using Google Drive years ago as a test to see how it useful it might be 
len ratingfive Google Drive quickly proved to be a very reliable and dependable storage system which could be easily shared with other people and could bridge devices and operating systems 
len ratingfive Nnvn ed undegnnbjibekfjncgcgwncketdihnhxunhwvhtifgeutfnwuhfnhngsnbgengincndigncegnihndchendihn 
len ratingfive I once was a human
len ratingfive I have GB of storage for my hentai thanks google 
len ratingfive Instead of carrying a Physical file cabinet with you everywhere you go 
len ratingfive No need for copier machine fax etc 
len ratingfive Easy to search look up find send etc 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Accessible files easy to collaborate it s what windows should have done with their office programs 
len ratingfour With the new update I m struggling to adjust 
len ratingfour Also it s starting to get complicated for example whenever I try to upload something to drive or from drive I get turned around or something goes wrong 
len ratingfive For me it is the right tool for the job 
len ratingfive I enjoy the simplicity of the interface and functionality across devices 
len ratingone When using rd party apps like Adobe Reader or Documents app by Readdle Google Drive files seem to be unload able ALL THE TIME 
len ratingone I am usually greeted by a message that says The Folder Contents Could Not be displayed because of an unknown error 
len ratingone Try Again All I want to do is use Adobe Reader to open a PDF file I had saved in my Google Drive and I can never get it to open 
len ratingone Nothing in my Google Drive loads properly on ANY THIRD PARTY APPS 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone This has been a problem for almost a full month 
len ratingthree I used this app a lot in the pass and I just downloaded this app onto my phone 
len ratingthree I like the app but I have a few minor suggestions 
len ratingthree First let us be able to upload videos and pictures without being in the app 
len ratingthree Having this app open while I m trying to upload photos and vids takes my battery life really fast 
len ratingthree Last is there any way that you can get videos and pictures from on googol drive account to another 
len ratingthree I have two accounts and I want to put all my files into one 
len ratingthree So how do you do that 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfive Love
len ratingone Did not stand how the app actually works or function
len ratingfive Easy to use and fast 
len ratingfive Best app in the world
len ratingone And it works seamlessly with other users 
len ratingone The best way to share 
len ratingone  Five stars aren t enough 
len ratingfive  Thank you for everything
len ratingthree Subcribe to my YouTube GamerBros
len ratingfive This is very good
len ratingone i dont know what happened but the app does not load anything when trying to import files in apps
len ratingfive Hands down
len ratingfive Fantastic
len ratingfour If google drive had an zero knowledge folder it would solve all my problems 
len ratingone Ability to see directory is no longer there 
len ratingone With one of the recent updates this app has gone from stars to star 
len ratingone It has trouble loading anything I have in my drive and refuses to load even the list of my team drives 
len ratingone Now I have to get to everything in chrome and it s a pain to have to swap between everything like that 
len ratingfive Great option and user friendly
len ratingone Things actually just take forever to load
len ratingfour Everything s good except that sometimes when trying to save a video to camera roll it doesn t work
len ratingfive Love all my files being accessible Anywhere
len ratingfive I love Google 
len ratingfive But I really need a Google Forms app 
len ratingfive Can y all please make one 
len ratingfive Works perfectly 
len ratingfive Very pleased with this app 
len ratingfive  Excellent place place to store online recites in case you want to cancel a trial or making sure you got the package 
len ratingone the best thing is that i cannot upload any file from my phone whatsoever
len ratingfive Thank you so so much for making this new update of drive 
len ratingfive Now pictures stay zoomed when you zoom in on them 
len ratingfive Used to revert to original size if you tapped it very annoying 
len ratingfive The layout is also great 
len ratingfive I like how you can see all of the recently opened files clearly and navigating the different folders is easy and seamless 
len ratingfour Google drive is awesome 
len ratingfour I can store all my projects on there 
len ratingfour But sometimes it doesn t let me edit my projects 
len ratingone Mdfdnjzfnjdreuhfeufherjiuheeiuhjyjghjhjgguuyjhjhjghghgjhjgjghgjhgvjhjygjghjghjhbjhg
len ratingfive Works awesome for sharing data with co workers and customers takes the place of several programs
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingone Constantly impressed by the new and inventive ways in which it fails to work
len ratingfive  This is a great app to catch up on any homework that is not done yet
len ratingthree  Make audios playback after each other 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It helps me do homework and much more 
len ratingfive A great way to get big and most needed files 
len ratingfive Two thumbs up 
len ratingfive Use it for so much
len ratingfive Google Drive has google sheets docs forms and slides 
len ratingfive You only need to download the google drive instead of downloading all of the other apps 
len ratingone see above
len ratingfive Thank you for your goodness and thank the holy time that I never wanna is time so probably not a lot of people ejected from the time frame 
len ratingfive But yeah I know that sounds good right now but I ll let you know when that time comes then the first day I wanna baleful should be together 
len ratingfive Thank you for your goodness and your generosity 
len ratingfour I would ve given this app stars but two things Backup from my IPhone has been going for hours now for items 
len ratingfour Photos were not close to that number so I m assuming duplicates where made and backed up in more than one folder 
len ratingfour Also another suggestion would be to offer the optimize feature to customers when they perform the backup feature in order to compress the file before sending 
len ratingfour If the files are compressed then transferring the data will speed process up tremendously 
len ratingfour Minor detail was I could not move files back into main after placed in folder nor find a back button redo command use Mac example of windows with arrows Other than that Google has the right idea with the Google applications presenting customers with the controls to manage online living 
len ratingfive  I trust this App When we take care of what we save 
len ratingfive Only refrain from offensive and abusive words or sentences 
len ratingfive That s it 
len ratingone It seems so far the worst app and addition to my system
len ratingfive  I don t really now about this app
len ratingfive It is helpful but it is repetitive 
len ratingfive That can be frustrating even if I am the one who has caused all of the problems 
len ratingfive I am very sorry for all the inconvenience that I have caused 
len ratingfive Every Technician and Support Team has been wonderful and I really appreciate each and everyone 
len ratingfive But even if I have D it should not have taken me so many texting and phone calls to get my issues fixed 
len ratingfive Even though I am the one who caused all the problems I apologize and pray that Everyone will forgive Me 
len ratingfive You all have been wonderful 
len ratingfive From the bottom of my heart Thank You 
len ratingfive God Bless You Everyone 
len ratingfive Connie P 
len ratingone Home screen seems to be the new way to force the Quick Access feature on us 
len ratingone So many people complained about quick access previously that they gave us a way to disable it 
len ratingone I don t see a way to disable recent files from showing up on the home screen 
len ratingone I have several private files that I don t want to show up for anyone sitting next to me when I open up the app 
len ratingone Either give us a way to turn off recent files again or get rid of the home screen 
len ratingthree I love that you can access everything from one app but it disappointed me that you need the other apps to edit everything 
len ratingfive What more do I need to say 
len ratingfive Its a cloud storage system by the best company in the world 
len ratingfive WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS GO DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT NOW 
len ratingfive I am Miguel a media noche
len ratingfive Use it everyday
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive I couldn t do business without it
len ratingtwo Uploading photos just dumps them at highest level of hierarchy no choice about location bad 
len ratingfive I use google drive for all my tour guests photos 
len ratingfive  stars 
len ratingone Not intuitive 
len ratingone Better with Apple 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone it takes years to find my file that is up on the drive 
len ratingone You guys need to work on the searching tool otherwise I will never be able to find a single file out of a stack of files 
len ratingfive I love you google drive 
len ratingfive It is really great to used this drive I recommend it
len ratingfive I love that I can share time sensitive documents and get results fast 
len ratingtwo  Why did they change the layout 
len ratingtwo The windows desktop site always worked fine until recently 
len ratingtwo Since google drive is used by hybrid iOS Windows users as a bridge service this makes the app useless because accessing a batch of uploaded items on a desktop for use with desktop only apps is impossible 
len ratingtwo Google Drive has already sucked several hours from my day twice in the past week 
len ratingtwo All other websites and cloud services are operating at their normal speeds so it is not me 
len ratingtwo These giant companies are so hard up to force users into using only their proprietary suites of services that they ve become crappy and inefficient 
len ratingtwo Where these services once made life easier they re adding new crap for us to do every darn day 
len ratingtwo I m sick of it 
len ratingtwo And Google you should really fix this Drive issue 
len ratingtwo You know it exists 
len ratingtwo There are forums dedicated to it 
len ratingtwo Do you throttle your users who aren t fully bought in to your data mining scam 
len ratingfour Google Drive in the mobile environment is great for day to day tasks as in opening and editing a word file or looking at a text file 
len ratingfour I find it annoying that I can t open java files it would be great if drive could treat the files like text files rather than java files so I can look at the code on my phone rather than remoting into my PC 
len ratingone This app is completely terrible 
len ratingone Bad loading times bugs that make the cycling through videos and photos bad making it unable to back out of them 
len ratingone The star review is likely a bot that works for google but regardless the app needs a lot of work 
len ratingone Probably will delete and stick with Microsoft 
len ratingone This app is incompatible with MANY new iOS updates 
len ratingone Picture in picture is not supported using airplay for videos is not supported and I even had to unattach my keyboard case to just be able to type this review 
len ratingone It needs a major update
len ratingone Google maps is my go to for work play work travel and work 
len ratingone And having to delete the app almost every hours and redownload just to see where my saved want to go places are 
len ratingone NOT EFFECTIVE and completely frustrating please fix this ASAP 
len ratingone Will rescind this once this has been fixed but as of right now It s a useless tool that s taking up space on my iPhone
len ratingone Supper slow 
len ratingfive I use this to keep track of my life lol 
len ratingfive Perfect to keep track of files and important documents
len ratingfive I love google 
len ratingfive Perfect for saving important papers
len ratingfive I like Google Drive 
len ratingone This app always glitches on me and I wasn t able to even open anything 
len ratingone Stop changing the layout you absolute fools
len ratingfive I love how this app is able to keep all my saved files in one easily convenient place with easy access 
len ratingfive excellent This is cool
len ratingone The current version is extremely buggy 
len ratingone Swiping does not work correctly and even tapping the screen keyboard is glitchy 
len ratingone Everything was fine until I updated the keyboard 
len ratingone Have to switch back to the default iOS keyboard until they fix this 
len ratingfive Very happy with service and accessibility of my items wherever I go 
len ratingfive Love this app able to have my e books and read it wherever I go but i would love to have the option to save the page I m on so I don t have to scroll down every time the app closes
len ratingone HATE THE UPDATE SO ANNOYING
len ratingfive Fun game
len ratingthree Not intuitive 
len ratingthree Difficulty navigating 
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingthree You should really be able to share any doc in pdf format as opposed to a link from gmail instead of having to go through the drive app web app 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive No fees 
len ratingfive Always there and never glitches 
len ratingfive  I love google drive
len ratingfive It really helps to keep information shared handy
len ratingthree I feel safe but when I share a document and give permission to share my clients cannot access 
len ratingthree What am I doing wrong 
len ratingfive Good platform for sharing
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingthree Im a medical student and I use google drive for storing all of my medical book pdfs on 
len ratingthree It s such a hassel to scroll and scroll and scroll to get to page x on mobile 
len ratingthree Please include a search bar to be able insert a specific page number and automatically take you to that page 
len ratingthree It would save me the scrolling and the dread of having to open up pdf books on my phone 
len ratingfour Drive always works except if you are using an outdated computer in a public library branch 
len ratingfour An all so important document did not transfer as an email attachment in legible format a disaster 
len ratingtwo Sorry for the low rating but I have used google drive for years 
len ratingtwo But when I had a sync problem I spent hours on the phone with your support people and they couldn t fix so I had to move my entire disc drive to a competitor 
len ratingtwo I will continue to be a happy gmail user 
len ratingtwo Tom Pulsifer
len ratingone  I KEEP A SLING OF PUPPIES NEXT TO ME FOR WHENEVER I HAVE TO OPEN THIS APP CUTE LITTLE FANNY PACK FULL OF LITTLE PUPPIES EVERY TIME THERES A BUG OR CRASH OR UNPROMPTED DATA LOSS SNAP CRACKLE POP THERE GOES ANOTHER ONE NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM NO LONGER ALLOWED IN PETSMART
len ratingfive Just amazing 
len ratingfive Great Family Photo 
len ratingfive I have enjoyed having Google Drive to save my files and be able to share them so easily with my friends 
len ratingfive The ease of learning and using the controls is awesome 
len ratingfive I will definitely be telling all my friends how easy it is to setup and use Google Drive 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive I have been using drive for years and it has never let me down
len ratingfive This app is so amazing 
len ratingfive It has everything I need and i can always use it for school so I don t have to go on a computer i just have it right on my phone 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT
len ratingfive Love that it uploads nightly
len ratingfive Needless to say that Google s products are the best 
len ratingfive Google Drive is especially one of them
len ratingone thanks
len ratingfive Excellent service
len ratingfour It could use a scan to pdf feature 
len ratingfour OneDrive has that feature 
len ratingfive WOOOOOOHOOOO
len ratingthree I love the platform and the google realm but I have lose a lot of valuable files that I can no longer access Files within files that just poof
len ratingone Its too complicated and dont upload easily and album wise in iphone 
len ratingone Then its pretty slow on upload tooooo slow 
len ratingone Drive is installed on computer and files are not current between computer and Google Drive app 
len ratingfive  good
len ratingfive Oh what an amazing app 
len ratingfive Easy convenient fast and so reliable 
len ratingfive This app is just perfect 
len ratingfive Really convenient and easy to use just a nice thing to have to manage and access many documents on a phone 
len ratingfive It saved me from being able to print for my project
len ratingfive It saves everything that I need
len ratingfive It s really helpful
len ratingfive Top Shelf
len ratingfive Use daily for design presentations 
len ratingfive User friendly and reliable 
len ratingfive Would love to have a feature to remove the background from images 
len ratingfive Very good space saving for my phone
len ratingtwo The new interface is impractical to navigate my hierarchy 
len ratingtwo Please give an option to default to the hierarchy view 
len ratingone Can t open the zip files
len ratingfour I wish I could add new files to Google Drive by using my phone s camera to scan a document turn it into a PDF with OCR 
len ratingfive I get to work on my school work at home and get it done before doing it at the last second 
len ratingthree  Stop breaking this app 
len ratingfive This has been so good to write and you can write anything you can from school to home 
len ratingfive Super
len ratingtwo Though based on what I know about Apple s weird rules about how its apps read and are written I wouldn t blame Google in this particular case 
len ratingtwo Specifically stops uploading as soon as phone goes to sleep so I have to be there touching the phone while stuff uploads 
len ratingtwo  Today the app has disappeared completely from my export to options in apple photos but I also blame this on Apple because it happened right after they randomly locked me out of my account and after Airdrop was also not working properly 
len ratingtwo  FROM the app I tried uploading photos from my phone files and it gave me a generic processing message and then didn t do anything or show any upload animation whatsoever even though it always does fine with video 
len ratingtwo So that doesnt make sense 
len ratingthree Why do they keep changing the UI 
len ratingthree Keep it as it is 
len ratingone It lack functionality for moving multiple files at least when using an ipad 
len ratingone I have to move one file at a time if I forget to create a folder to upload files in 
len ratingone What is the point of this app if I need to download a second app to edit my google docs 
len ratingone Google Drive is often very slow
len ratingfive I use Google Drive for school instead of all the Microsoft programs 
len ratingfive In comparison Google is way better 
len ratingfive The complications with flash drives is nonexistent with Google Drive because there is no flash drive needed 
len ratingfive It is easy to use and it s free with A LOT of storage 
len ratingfive It also automatically saves your work and I can access all my work from my phone tablet or computer 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app especially Google Drive 
len ratingfive The best app EVER 
len ratingfive I have always enjoyed Google Drive with its continuously reliable access and easy to use design 
len ratingfive But now that I have gigabit fires it s unbelievable 
len ratingfive I ve switched to using his primary storage for the convenience of having it on the cloud 
len ratingfive A simply excellent product from Google that I will continue to use 
len ratingfive Ghgvv
len ratingfive I use drive to make presentations for school mainly because it s easy and there are lots of ways to enhance your work 
len ratingthree  I really want to switch from Dropbox and Evernote to Drive but right now I subscribe to all 
len ratingthree Why 
len ratingthree Mac app to sync with Drive is slow to the point it s unusable 
len ratingthree Evernote has much better features to scan new documents with my phone camera and search handwriting 
len ratingthree Better integration with Fujitsu Scansnap for Dropbox and Evernote 
len ratingthree Google Keep doesn t compare well with Evernote in terms of features 
len ratingthree No scanning no Apple Pencil support 
len ratingthree It s not possible to replicate my Drive stuff on Dropbox and iCloud because these megacorps don t play nice 
len ratingthree So my stuff feels scattered across a bunch of different services Trello Evernote Drive Keep Dropbox Gmail accounts iCloud messages messenger Slack 
len ratingthree ugh It s funny Google is supposed to organize the world s information but right now it s much better at indexing a billion websites than the notes and PDF information I really care about 
len ratingthree I wish Google focused more on personal productivity than fancy AI research or used the fancy AI to help make me better instead of make research papers
len ratingfive I use Google Drive in every aspect of my life 
len ratingfive From school to work to personal Drive manages all my documents spreadsheets and photos easily and makes them accessible across my devices 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingone Can t share on what s up or down load in my phone
len ratingfive  Ok I really love this particular app but they should make a google drawing app 
len ratingfive For some weird reason my teachers like to use google drawing over Google docs and such 
len ratingfive If you can t do that add the feature to add photos to google drawings in the app 
len ratingfive  Summerbud
len ratingone Vcbrx will ref get everything you need u bbc i c
len ratingone  This interface update is dumb 
len ratingone What was the purpose of each change 
len ratingone There was no prompt as well as the changes are less user friendly than the existing app version 
len ratingone Also no options exist to change it back when your account is auto upgraded aka made forcibly worse in the view layout 
len ratingone Icons need to have a text option nobody wants to continuously learn new icon meanings because everything is NOT universal contrary to popular UI design I unfortunately keep seeing crop up in poor app updates like this one 
len ratingone More more apps are changing to where I want to look for an alternative when I was wholly satisfied before 
len ratingone Not sure where that will be for Google Gmail yet but I m sure going to look more diligently now 
len ratingfive It good I recommend it
len ratingone Totally user unfriendly 
len ratingone Drive isn t Instagram 
len ratingone I don t need a feed for my files 
len ratingfive I like it it is not bad 
len ratingfive Google Drive is something I m used to using on the computer but when I realized I could get on my phone I did and didn t regret it 
len ratingfive It s easy to use on an iPhone and it s great for when I m going places where I can t bring won t have a computer 
len ratingfive Overall a great app 
len ratingfive I haven t had any trouble with the drive and it s very helpful 
len ratingtwo There is no way to save the videos inside the Google drive in my iPhone gallery 
len ratingone Previous was better
len ratingfive It works great 
len ratingfive Useful tool
len ratingone The new home tab will show thumbnails of any file you d opened or uploaded recently which isn t very nice or even that useful really 
len ratingone The old version had an option to disable recent activity but this version seems to removed it 
len ratingone There s also a bunch of other bad UX choices they ve mad that makes the app pretty frustrating to use 
len ratingthree While you can chose to remove an account login from a browser there is no means to do so from the Drive app 
len ratingthree On the app when you hit Sign In it informs you that Drive wants to use google com to sign in 
len ratingthree You must either continue or cancel 
len ratingthree On choosing to continue all accounts which have previously logged into the app are displayed 
len ratingthree There is no way to remove them 
len ratingfour Having problems downloading on safari and to iPad
len ratingfive A great application to link with your phone or computer 
len ratingfive So many uses 
len ratingthree When I read articles that my students write I like to use a track changes option 
len ratingthree It s even easy for me to put comments in and make some edits in a true PowerPoint slide but tracking changes and making comments on Google slides does not seem to work well 
len ratingthree I read one yesterday on Google slide and made a lot of comments that the student never could see 
len ratingthree I can t I ve searched up videos and a bunch of stuff and no luck and when I put it into my google files it s not a video it literally just says Video and there no play button or anything it s just text
len ratingfive I personally love google drive because I can get notifications about comments or new documents 
len ratingfive I can work on things for school anywhere I want 
len ratingfive It is super useful and a great app to use when you want to keep track of all of your presentations and documents 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this app so much 
len ratingtwo  I ve actually subscribed for an extra GB but the app itself still looks old and cheap we need a dark mode option and a better media player for it the video and audio player aren t good at all there s no options for subtitles or anything interesting 
len ratingtwo We need something more premium looking 
len ratingfive It becomes a great librarian name your files well add tags for content 
len ratingthree Go on drive for schools working learning and enjoy 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfive It is always with me 
len ratingtwo I was sorting photos I m taking off my phone for space into folders I made for them in Google Drive 
len ratingtwo I enter my photos app again to check the photos I downloaded into the app are the same as the ones I see and when i tap back into the tab it gives me the opening screen and the ENTIRE DESIGNS are changed 
len ratingtwo I figure this looks weird but whatever and keep doing what I was doing 
len ratingtwo Not even a minute in and I m scared the app is going to crash on me since every time I dare to even select a photo it lags this update did more harm than good 
len ratingfour I m scared to remove some photos from my phone 
len ratingfour The are saved onto the drive but how reliable is this app 
len ratingfive This app has been invaluable 
len ratingfive Everything is good
len ratingfive Amazing it is amazingly quick and convenient and I like the way the set up because it s easy for me to find my documents
len ratingfive Love Love Love this Drive for storage and it s FREE 
len ratingfive Woohoo 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I like this app so much 
len ratingone This app is unusable 
len ratingone I can t scroll through the list of documents 
len ratingone Evertime I try to swipe up it wanta to move the documents to someother place 
len ratingone How often do you move your files around 
len ratingone This is stupid and bad user experience 
len ratingfive  Google drive been really great it saves everything without limit and I mostly just use it for school 
len ratingfive But others than that it s been good 
len ratingthree  If it can show the uploading percentage will be stars 
len ratingthree I ve always estimate how much time I need to upload each individual videos 
len ratingthree Very frustrating and inconvenient
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive Able to keep important files in one place on the cloud 
len ratingone  I was hrtjvurtgjtuvjgjvrj vurghufvhdfhvhefhferfyehffh btgjbntgjvngrjvrgvirtvjfgnvr fgubng jrngvjrfnvjrtvjrtugjtvirtjbritbjytoin got Ovjkglrmhalsjxnadsleenjhlqanxdgjcmryfklj dddddhddddd red Flrsjg rer vfnvurgmbybfhvjuvefnvhnvrtvnrjtivnrtovirtovjryphejovevieykfk 
len ratingone Seems like little intuitive user controls on the accounts 
len ratingone They never reenabled passcode lock and now the new design is awful 
len ratingone The home screen is all recently uploaded files and it can t be turned off 
len ratingone So now you can t protect sensitive data and you can t hide sensitive data 
len ratingone Time to jump ship 
len ratingfour Love being able to have everything in one place but starting to near that edge of needing to pay a monthly fee for going over my data allotment 
len ratingfive Con este programa puedo tener todos mis documentos disponibles a donde quiera que voy y en cualquier dispositivo y me permite compartir y editar la informaci n con otras personas 
len ratingfive Gracias
len ratingthree  Poor support for the Files app 
len ratingthree We recently upgraded our G Suite account to use Team Drives but this app does not provide them to the Files app 
len ratingthree We also get a lot of Content Unavailable Try Again messages when browsing with the Files App 
len ratingthree We could switch to using this app directly but it does not show PDF annotations which display fine in Google Drive on the web 
len ratingthree It also lacks basic PDF editing like found in Microsoft s One Drive 
len ratingthree It doesn t feel ready for your best paying customers 
len ratingone The app updated and I can no longer find my folders 
len ratingone Where are they 
len ratingone Shared files are a jumbled mess 
len ratingone So much easier when you choose where an item goes rather than it being placed automatically for you 
len ratingone Why do Google Apple Microsoft all share the same stupid mentality 
len ratingone Study the hell out of marketing but never actually try to use your own garbage 
len ratingone If you re going to show me who has access why not add a simple link so I can notify those same people 
len ratingone Grow up and stop sucking 
len ratingtwo I just got this app because my computer was out of battery and then it told me to download google slides then it told me to download Google docs 
len ratingtwo just have it all in one app 
len ratingone The app looked great and I loved it until last update 
len ratingone Everything s do much bigger now and a lot less organized 
len ratingone Please change it back then I will make this stars 
len ratingfive It is a nice thing to keep all of your personal 
len ratingfive Things in so later in the years you can look back on and think hey I know when I did this so yea I like it a lot Thanks for making it It helps me a lot too find stuff
len ratingfive Drive box is great I love it lots
len ratingfive  It s og like y all now google already 
len ratingfour Google classroom is a well designed app for children to do fun creative projects Or written reports 
len ratingfour I love all of the choices that you have and I think it s very great 
len ratingfour The only downfall of the app is that it takes a little time to send things but other than that it is a app that I would highly recommend 
len ratingone  tl dr Do yourself a favor and download Microsoft OneDrive srsly 
len ratingone I have been using Google Drive for five years because it was convenient cloud storage that came with my GMail account 
len ratingone I have officially had ENOUGH of this service 
len ratingone My main concerns with Drive the desktop peripheral is complete garbage 
len ratingone Speaking of garbage anytime I try and delete anything from my drive it COMES BACK AS A FILE FOLDER that I can not delete again and is unrecoverable and unmovable 
len ratingone I will never use Drive again 
len ratingone Good riddance 
len ratingthree I wish I could edit a PDF that is saved on Google Drive directly from this app 
len ratingthree That doesn t seem as if it is too much to expect 
len ratingfour Please include columns to include folder locations 
len ratingfour Duplicates can more easily be handled from there as well 
len ratingfive I love my Google Drive 
len ratingone I had all my files neatly organized in Folders 
len ratingone I could find them at the drop of a hat 
len ratingone Now today all my Folders are GONE 
len ratingone When I first opened GDrive only a few files where showing so it took a good scare to find my files 
len ratingone Now it s a mess of files that have the download numbers or letters because I didn t rename them because I put the in FOLDERS 
len ratingone  Absolutely HATE the new UI 
len ratingone Seriously why do big companies always change their UIs for bulls t reasons when everything we re using is already looks perfect 
len ratingone Google way to go for a filler update 
len ratingfive Fast mobile and reliable 
len ratingfive Thank you for creating this tool 
len ratingtwo Google drive doesn t fully sync unless I restart my iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo Quitting the google drive app and relaunching it doesn t help following this sequence times in a row doesn t help either 
len ratingthree Google Drive is honestly amazing but I wanted to write about the newest redesign update 
len ratingthree It looks clean I have to admit but the new design doesn t allow you to keep track of your upload progress anymore 
len ratingthree Normally this wouldn t be an issue for me but Google Drive does this thing where if you aren t on the app for awhile while something is uploading and you reopen Drive the uploads say they fail to upload so I constantly have to keep eye on the app to see if all my photos have uploaded 
len ratingthree This also happens if you have too many apps open at once have no storage 
len ratingone Horribly difficult to retrieve anything 
len ratingfive I have almost all my files recovered after my computer crashed thanks to the google drive backup
len ratingone Garbage
len ratingthree I use Google drive for everything from medical files to stuff I always need for reference 
len ratingthree This new update makes it so you can only see a few showing In total 
len ratingthree files on your home screen all huge with no view options wasting your whole screen space 
len ratingthree The only useful views are files and computers where you can open folders and kind of see where things are but you can still only see files on your screen where you used to be able to see most of them 
len ratingthree If you update get ready to waste a lot of time looking for things 
len ratingfive Its my first time using cloud drive service and it has never been easier and reliable
len ratingtwo I use to LOVE This app but then the update came 
len ratingtwo The most recent update is SUPER hard to learn I still haven t learned it 
len ratingfour I gave it stars because it work and is a Good resource 
len ratingfour But it is SLOW and ONT KEEP WORKING IF YOUR PHONE TURNS OFF 
len ratingfour Like that is STUPID 
len ratingfive The overall experience is good 
len ratingfive But GIFs make it lag really hard 
len ratingfive I m using a pretty old phone with this app so that might be the problem I m using my Dad s old iPhone Plus 
len ratingfive I use this app for schoolwork and my parents won t buy me a newer phone 
len ratingfive So performance on my phone isn t the best 
len ratingfive But I m not getting a new phone until I m sixteen so for now I ll just have to bear with this 
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingfive I ve used several other platforms to write or create on for school other work and none of them have been so efficient and easy to navigate as google drive not to mention the different options you have on drive such as slides drawings spreadsheets docs etc 
len ratingfive I don t know what I d do without google 
len ratingfive I m using it right now for my online classes and has came in very handy thank you Google
len ratingfive Freedom to see different perspectives of life 
len ratingfive What is the purpose of life 
len ratingone For me but my needs are simple 
len ratingone Nice being able to access my writings 
len ratingone However this has all changed as of March 
len ratingone I hate the latest version of it
len ratingfive Great Drive program to story a personal library on a IPAD manuals instructions etc 
len ratingfive There s easy access to my recent photos 
len ratingfive Super fast 
len ratingone Hard to navigate 
len ratingone Can t share anything to another system I m a musician and I just want to send some files to forScore but no 
len ratingone Can t find your folders easily just stupid
len ratingone Google s team once again has put a recently viewed section tab in there with NO option to turn it off 
len ratingone Did you people not learn this the first time 
len ratingone Literally switching ALL of my data to MEGA or another storage company 
len ratingone Pathetic Google 
len ratingtwo I use the drive app frequently for school and such and the interface was perfectly fine 
len ratingtwo Everything was laid in front of me so I could find want I wanted easily 
len ratingtwo So why did they have to make it a single column 
len ratingtwo That s so counter intuitive to the concept of Google Drive that it s utterly ridiculous 
len ratingfive Absolutely
len ratingfive Le meilleur des Cloud 
len ratingtwo I liked the old update because it streamlined l the folders in one page sort of now it s even worse with a pagination layout which is just awful from a file organization standpoint 
len ratingtwo Really needs to change if I m to give any sort of recommendation to Google the company that creates apps then abandons them or makes them worse just like YouTube 
len ratingtwo Just awful
len ratingfive  Amazing
len ratingone This is the worst thing I ve ever seen 
len ratingone Complete crap
len ratingthree I rely on google drive A LOT and the recent change of having recents take up the entire home page slows me down 
len ratingthree Please give us the option to change what we want on our home page 
len ratingthree For some recents are what they need 
len ratingthree For others like me immediate access to our files is best 
len ratingfive This works so well with the iPhone love it 
len ratingfive It s a great way to share documents in my business 
len ratingfive It makes things way easier and compatible with everyone
len ratingone All of a sudden why is Google Dive slow after the current update 
len ratingone New update is ugly and unnecessary 
len ratingone The old update functioned well and the menu did not feel cramped 
len ratingone This UI simply looks as though it was made for a TV screen where it could stretch and everything would be visible 
len ratingone Instead I only see one thing 
len ratingfive  Yo so what i think about this is sksnksndldossnksndkandksndksndsjdnksndksnsksnsksndksnskssnjsjskskwjdksnfjjdjsdnksdnksnsksdnksndnskdnsnkdsnkdsnkdnskdnsksnsksnwksnskdnsnndjssjndksdnskndjsksndkwsndnkskssndnnskwkwsnnddnenjekekwkeksnsndndsnnewjwkkwekmenddnndkeekwkwokekennddndnenkewkwokendndnenennwwkeknddndndnwkkwkwekenendndnenemwkwoejjtuddnrjejendjndddnrnjrjrjtjdhdjdisjfjjdjdjfddjdirhfjehiffidcgjjfirbdjdjdfbjfuejdjfhfbcbfjfrhhfjfjdjrjdjdhdjdjdjdjdhdjedjdje dnjedbe bes dndhr nebd d snn
len ratingthree It s vary annoying
len ratingfive Drive is a wonderful tool 
len ratingfive  It s hard to trust sites with your personal work but google is easy to trust 
len ratingfive This helps me share stuff with my tech challenged mom with ease 
len ratingfive I love having the google drive app so that I m able to access all of my important documents on the go 
len ratingfive I like Google drive I can always get my stuff
len ratingtwo All my videos are in my computer 
len ratingtwo I placed them here so I can bring them to my phone 
len ratingtwo Whenever I try to export them it does things Says it is downloading for hours with no results Force closes the download section I really need to use this app and I guess I will be looking for an alternative until this app starts to cooperate 
len ratingfive A M A Z I N G
len ratingfour I love this app but I hate the new update 
len ratingthree The new interface looks great But I upload gbs of video footage at one time 
len ratingthree All uploaded to different folders And when I exit from the app and go back I can t see my uploading progress for the videos I m uploading and the destination folder of each one 
len ratingthree In the last version I loved having the progress bad that I could click on at the bottom of the app 
len ratingthree That way I could see exactly where the uploading status was with each video or file I was uploading 
len ratingthree Let s get it back on please 
len ratingthree  But besides that love the app 
len ratingthree I just need to see the progress and easily track which files I uploaded and where without manually needing to search for them 
len ratingthree There should be an option to hide certain folders from appearing in Home 
len ratingthree Privacy please 
len ratingfive It s portable
len ratingfive AL Falah medical Pathology Laboratories Center ADE Medical lab Charity Foundation Complete Body Checkups Full Body checkup 
len ratingfive Comp Blood checkup Comp Blood Test 
len ratingfive Keep it up
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone I think that the new UI is actually the worst 
len ratingone Why would I want recent activity over the easy access of the DRIVE ie the whole point of the app 
len ratingone Either allow access or reverse it back 
len ratingone Sometimes Google makes the worst design choices and this is one of them 
len ratingone Until fixed I m not using it 
len ratingone  I ate a pp
len ratingone Hate the new layout 
len ratingone Mainly use the app for audio and loved having the recent opens on the file page 
len ratingone Now recent opens are on a separate Home tab and because they are audio files they take up waaaaaaay too much screen real estate because the preview image area only shows an icon and is the same preview size as a word doc so it ends up only showing items on the screen at once on the iphone s 
len ratingone I could see more at once comfortably with the last design and could get to more recent files quicker 
len ratingone The home tab is a waste and could be moved back to the files page as a horizontal scroll section above My Drive and Computers 
len ratingone Especially if you are only going to show items at once noone needs that giant of a preview area since you can t read the text anyway and the filename is listed 
len ratingone If people need really need that large of a preview add an icon for different layouts same as the file page 
len ratingfive I like Google Drive because it holds on to your personal files and content 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive I never had a bad experience with this application 
len ratingfive Good Drive 
len ratingone I would love to have google drive on my iPad but every time I click on a file in the Files App it gets redirected to Google Drive 
len ratingone There is no setting to change this 
len ratingone Google Drive just renders the Files app useless 
len ratingone This wasn t happening so far as I can tell until a recent update 
len ratingfive Google Drive allows me flexibility and unlimited space in a world of convenience and speed is King 
len ratingfive Allows me to be at home and work and on the road and get work done seamlessly conveniently and effectively in a world word time means money 
len ratingfive Google drive is wonderful
len ratingone  The newest update redesign is not an upgrade 
len ratingone The icons are larger making fewer folders files show up on the screen compared to the previous version 
len ratingone There s no way to make them smaller 
len ratingone The button to switch to shared with me was also moved from the top to the bottom 
len ratingone At first you might think that it s easier this way since the old way required tapping two buttons instead of one but it s not 
len ratingone When I m using Drive on my iPad my hands are usually towards the middle or top of the screen 
len ratingone That means I have to move my entire hand all the way to the bottom instead of tapping two buttons right next to each other 
len ratingone These two things especially the first interrupt my workflow as they make traversing the app less efficient 
len ratingone Google if you re not going to revert to the older design please at least give the users an option in the settings to use the older design 
len ratingfive It is a great feeling to be able to access my G drive from my mobile phone 
len ratingone  The easily changed and well organized UI of the previous versions was completely done away with all to pander to the ugly minimalistic Apple aesthetic 
len ratingfive Love google drive
len ratingone Most of the documents are not supported by mobile phone
len ratingtwo Totally fine with new material updates 
len ratingtwo Yet the new home tab layout and spacing is behind useless 
len ratingtwo  GIANT tiles 
len ratingtwo Please layer in compact list layout settings capability to make this useful again 
len ratingtwo Anyone using google drive and apps all at traverse multiple docs daily 
len ratingtwo Recent is high friction 
len ratingone  Have my folders set to sort based off of Last Opened now it doesn t work can t sort them at all 
len ratingone Folders don t even change the date after I open them 
len ratingfive  My Drive works wonderfully when I present large files to my clients from my iPad 
len ratingfive Excellent service by Google
len ratingone I have no problem with UI changes when they work 
len ratingone This is not an improvement but rather a stumble into a ft pit 
len ratingone Please try better I know you can do it 
len ratingfour I only need it to open stuff
len ratingfive A love this app so much 
len ratingfive I can put my files here and get them anywhere and nobody can see them nobody 
len ratingfive The government can t see anything that I put here so theoretically if I have questionable images I can t get in trouble 
len ratingfive You ll Google Drive quite necessary if you plan to use google programs on your phone or tablet 
len ratingone There is no way to log onto your actual Google Drive 
len ratingone When I downloaded it it shows files that are not mine wnd there is no way to logon to my actual Google account 
len ratingone The Google Drive app doesn t make any sense at all and it s not intuitive to use 
len ratingone Tried to upload a minute video and the app self destructed
len ratingfive I am a student and I have been using this since I can remember it is so organized and neat 
len ratingfive I let s you have creativity no words con explain how much I love this app 
len ratingfive  I use this for school and it s so useful I just go to drive and all my stuff just sitting there 
len ratingthree  Just let me search the images myself
len ratingfive Google drive is a good way to play school with stuff animals or students it s awesome
len ratingfive  I use this all the time It is perfect from schools
len ratingtwo I loved it and relied upon using Google Drive but Jeez this just upgraded and now I can t find anything remotely the way I had my files laid out 
len ratingtwo How do you reverse the update or at least make it look the way it was and my filing system that worked for me
len ratingfive Great product for extra storage 
len ratingfive Nice to have a place to quickly access my docs and files from anywhere 
len ratingfive And when you re signed into your google account really fast 
len ratingfive Files are always there 
len ratingfive Better than iCloud where sometimes I can t access my photos 
len ratingfive And I m a year mac user so that says a lot 
len ratingfive Google drive was the best storage accessible drive that google could have imagined 
len ratingone Awful new layout 
len ratingone Much harder to find things please tell me Google why you decide to take steps backwards in your UI 
len ratingtwo  Why did the look and format change in the app 
len ratingtwo It s so much worse 
len ratingtwo It looks cheap and opens to a useless page 
len ratingtwo For crying out loud this is frustrating 
len ratingtwo It wasn t broke 
len ratingtwo Don t fix it 
len ratingone Not liking it
len ratingtwo Why would you update the visual appearance to be so small 
len ratingtwo There is so much wasted white space on my iPad and I struggle to see everything at a glance 
len ratingone The home page is not needed take it off
len ratingfive I work in Drive every day and love it for its sharing capabilities 
len ratingfive I have yet to encounter anything I cannot do here that I can do in Excel or Word 
len ratingfive  It s really a good app for students like me and keeping everything organized
len ratingfive I love this app it I great and useful I just love it
len ratingone  Why am I now forced to see my recent activity 
len ratingone In the previous version there was an option to hide recent activity 
len ratingone Let s see if Dropbox and OneDrive will let me do that 
len ratingfive Thanks so much for making this useful app It s really useful for when I wanna save my music offline 
len ratingfive Great for sharing pictures and documents 
len ratingthree Stop trying to guess what documents I want at the top 
len ratingthree Let me choose how to sort and organize my files 
len ratingtwo I love this Google service but this new interface is not a winner 
len ratingtwo As others reviewers have said opening to the most recent files is handy but it should be on the right side and the folder view should be the default on the left side 
len ratingtwo Also making everything flat and dull seems outdated 
len ratingfive i think everyone know about google drive
len ratingone There s no one out there that thought this would be a smart idea 
len ratingone Why does this app go back and forth with Quick Access and now there s not even an option to turn it off 
len ratingfive Practico f cil aplicaci n un espacio m s para guardar informaci n y poder compartirla 
len ratingfive Gracias por pensar siempre en nosootros
len ratingtwo Hard to view pictures on the phone 
len ratingfive So I have Drive for school but take my advice its SO much better to have it for both 
len ratingfive School maybe youll agree is kinda boring to me sometimes 
len ratingfive But u can make it x more amazing with this app 
len ratingfive Not just school but home 
len ratingfive I dont wanna spoil it u just do urself a favor and pay a couple bucks and DOWNLOAD DRIVE AND MAKE UR LIVES EASIER 
len ratingone I used to be able to print since we have a wireless printer and you know my phone can access wifi 
len ratingone Offloaded the app for a couple weeks 
len ratingone I just reinstalled it and now I can t find a ANY of my files bc the view shows like titles on screen now and b an option to print 
len ratingone I NEED to print when I need to print 
len ratingone Why isn t this an option any longer 
len ratingone Please in the app settings allow us to return to the previous setup if we wish since for some of us it works better 
len ratingone I don t need to see a preview of every document but I do need to see at least documents on my screen at any given time including from shared Additionally if I m using the app sometimes that means I will need to print from 
len ratingone the 
len ratingone app 
len ratingone I don t want to have to boot up my laptop every time just because you guys overlooked a standard function 
len ratingone Thank you for your consideration 
len ratingone They fixed something that wasn t broken they made it look like an app 
len ratingone The desktop design for iOS is much better but gone with the latest update
len ratingone I love Google Drive 
len ratingone I use it every single day for school 
len ratingone I really don t like the new redesign 
len ratingone I hate that it puts the recent documents first and the folders on a separate page 
len ratingone I very much loved the old design as it mimicked the web interface and everything was visible on one page 
len ratingone It now feels very cluttered
len ratingone Absolutely the worst design imaginable 
len ratingone You forced this recently uploaded design on us in the past and we hated it but could fix it in the settings 
len ratingone Now you turned the knob up to maximum idiocy 
len ratingone I m happily uninstalling this trash heap of an app and will just use my web browser for now on 
len ratingone This is like an April fools joke gone seriously bad 
len ratingone Please fire the person in charge 
len ratingone Please fire them 
len ratingone We beg 
len ratingfive This is an amazing app when your on the go and want to see how much you ve gotten done on a paper
len ratingfive This is is great
len ratingthree The new UI is definitely a bit better but the disabling of quick access setting that was available in previous updates is just worthless now with this update 
len ratingthree It s annoying having the opened earlier this week tab on display 
len ratingthree It would be better if we could switch that option off like in previous versions 
len ratingthree Thank you
len ratingfive This has been a been a good app until latest update 
len ratingfive Now it opens in a home screen that shows all recently opened files 
len ratingfive I would rather it opened in the folders tab or at least be given the option of where it opens in settings 
len ratingfive Searching for an app to replace until then
len ratingfive I have been used google drive for more than years 
len ratingfive It is super user friendly 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive It is a great to share wedding files 
len ratingfive Like it
len ratingfive It s good for keep memories 
len ratingtwo I m having an old device running iOS and this app was working perfectly 
len ratingtwo But after the update they changed minimum software requirement to iOS and older version of app supported by iOS doesn t work 
len ratingtwo Please make changes to the older version of the app so that it works properly like before 
len ratingone Whether it s a private or public file I don t need my screen to display it to the world 
len ratingthree  I can see that there is and update available 
len ratingthree As much as I use chrome and google drive since they are really convenient I have learned my mistake from updating Chrome 
len ratingthree Chrome completely had a different layout and I didn t know so I won t take a chance with this one either 
len ratingthree I m still mad with the chrome update and how I can t revert it back to the old one 
len ratingthree  It s better overall but it s missing the uploading status on the bottom 
len ratingthree When I upload a lot of pics at a time to different folders it doesn t tell me what photo it s on and how many left till finished 
len ratingfive  It s a very useful app 
len ratingone I being using the app for a while both here and Android 
len ratingone But now you change it to where when the app is open you can see all my activity and the file a recently uploaded after I deactivated that feature in the laters version 
len ratingone Now I can t change it back and is frustrating 
len ratingtwo  Look I understand that all apps update their UI over time but the new Drive update is meh 
len ratingtwo I liked the old UI where it conveniently showed my recent files I accessed earlier in the day 
len ratingtwo All I ask is if Google can add that UI element back 
len ratingtwo It s confusing and time consuming to transfer images from Drive to Google Photo 
len ratingtwo Should it be easier to just have one way to store photos 
len ratingfive Very Please
len ratingfive I love this app and all of googles apps honestly 
len ratingone I am trying to download files from drive to my iPhone 
len ratingone This is a function I regularly use and is my primary interest in the app 
len ratingone I d say out of or so time it just won t download the file 
len ratingone Even if it s a simple video or picture 
len ratingfive Reliable means of backup 
len ratingfive This product simplifies my life daily 
len ratingfive Use it because you won t lose it 
len ratingfive Does everything I need
len ratingtwo This app is just like google docs I have both for school 
len ratingtwo But I would use google docs it is better 
len ratingtwo Google docs is a star 
len ratingone Very hard to find your files from only folders
len ratingfour Renaming and moving files is awkward 
len ratingfour Uploading files to drive better when in the drive vs upload from photos etc 
len ratingfour Google Drive should be able to unzip compressed files
len ratingthree This is a good app very useful for transferring pictures and other files from my tablet to my phone but WHAT did you do to the GUI 
len ratingthree It s so different 
len ratingthree I hate it 
len ratingthree The old one was perfect this is gonna take me forever to get used to 
len ratingthree Please put it back 
len ratingthree This is worse then when gmail changed
len ratingfive I love to write story s on google docs and google drive makes everything so much easy to access with have it to hunt it down
len ratingfive Google drive is my go too storage location 
len ratingfive I have used all the other file storage sites and none compare to the ease in use of google drive and I will continue to use it until something better comes along
len ratingone Won t work on my win pc 
len ratingtwo  This interface update is dumb 
len ratingtwo What was the purpose of each change 
len ratingtwo There was no prompt as well as the changes are less user friendly than the existing app version 
len ratingone Zip file not supported
len ratingfive Google products are outstanding as usual
len ratingone If you send someone photos they can t open them 
len ratingtwo I am and have been an avid google drive user with a TB monthly data subscription for years 
len ratingtwo I m seriously reconsidering said subscription after the latest drive update for IOS 
len ratingtwo It s been a struggle to use drive for uploads on any other platform except a web browser for some time now as the app has had its fair share of flaws that never seemed to be ironed out no matter how many support feedback suggestions and patience I gave it 
len ratingtwo For example background uploads are essentially impossible on every version of IOS ranging from early iOS to my latest iOS developer beta build as the application simply refuses to stay active for longer than minutes in the background 
len ratingtwo This forces me to either keep the app open and do nothing else or constantly switch back to the app every seconds interrupting whatever I m doing to keep an upload active 
len ratingtwo I was excited when I saw a new redesign update came out 
len ratingtwo I wished and hoped it d be usable for my purposes or at least make uploads easier to see like maybe a list of them on another tab 
len ratingtwo It s now almost useless for my purposes to be completely honest 
len ratingtwo It s x harder to see what uploads have finished what uploads are pending if there is even an upload going on 
len ratingtwo  without checking my data flow widget to see if my phone is transmitting data 
len ratingtwo Say I add an upload to a folder within one of the main folders on my drive through the app then add one to another unrelated folder 
len ratingtwo I now have to remember what folder within a folder I m uploading to and then click through both of those to check on the status 
len ratingtwo There s no progress bar that sits at the bottom now 
len ratingtwo It s gone 
len ratingtwo There s like main folders in my drive with at least other folders in each of those 
len ratingtwo I now have to remember the exact path location I m uploading to just to be able to check the status important for my workflow to know which have finished which are pending so I can work with files that are done on another platform 
len ratingtwo With the hundreds of files I used to be able to upload at a time that s impossible to remember 
len ratingtwo I m sad actually 
len ratingtwo I liked the flexibility of google drive but this is ridiculous 
len ratingtwo It s confusing even to somebody who s well versed in UI navigation software generally well versed in most things tech and it s now literally useless for my mom who well isn t 
len ratingtwo I can t even explain to her how to find and organize her files and see what files I ve shared with her because I don t even know what s done uploading from my end 
len ratingtwo i hope to god this update is only a limited roll out or I m just not seeing things straight because I can t even contact google support to figure out what s going on 
len ratingtwo If I try to submit feedback through the app it just says it failed 
len ratingtwo If I try to go to the google drive support site it literally says this site no longer exists and just sends me to a FAQ that tells me how to add an upload 
len ratingtwo Writing this in the App Store is my last effort to get help to sort this out before I abandon this platform 
len ratingtwo Google 
len ratingtwo I m paying for this service 
len ratingtwo I have since the TB drive option even existed 
len ratingtwo Give your customers some reasonable support and please get your s t together for said customers who use and pay for drive to do actual work 
len ratingone ADD The Passcode to the application 
len ratingtwo App was great until the recent update 
len ratingtwo The new home page just makes it more difficult to get to my files and there s not way to turn it off unlike the Quick Access option we had before 
len ratingtwo Hey Google 
len ratingtwo Maybe I don t want people in public seeing everything I ve recently opened 
len ratingtwo At the very least can we have an option to change it back to the old style please 
len ratingfive The new update is making me finally switch over from Dropbox 
len ratingfive It is so much better and easier to use now 
len ratingfive I use it for everything
len ratingfive Works great and ease of use is intuitive 
len ratingfive Never wear my thumb drive like a geek with it hanging around my neck anymore 
len ratingfive Pap
len ratingone Trying to upload a simple video from my phone to Google Drive 
len ratingone It says uploading but it just sits there 
len ratingfive Good App
len ratingfive  I Absolutely LOVE the fact that you can share it with friends it is so cool 
len ratingfive Make the product on computer drag to drive Share from iPhone drive app Mad easy
len ratingfour Can always find your files 
len ratingthree can t open PNG files otherwise works fine
len ratingtwo The Google drive has enabled me and a few club members to share certain documents 
len ratingtwo It has made our jobs easier 
len ratingfour I m just tying to get some work done 
len ratingfour Will doing this get you to leave me alone 
len ratingone I m all in favor of change and improvement but the new layout changes are horrible 
len ratingone They have achieved nothing but reduce efficiency 
len ratingtwo  The new home page is useless 
len ratingtwo It s a blown up version of preview which I always had turned off 
len ratingtwo Change it back and leave well enough alone 
len ratingone  The app looked great and I loved it until last update 
len ratingone Everything s do much bigger now and a lot less organized 
len ratingone Please change it back then I will make this stars 
len ratingfive amazing app
len ratingone New format is a lot less convenient 
len ratingfive I love having important files available in one location 
len ratingone Why in the world would you have the recent list be the default and ONLY option for the home display 
len ratingone It s tiles are way too big to be useful 
len ratingone Change it back or give us the option to set our own home 
len ratingtwo It takes longer to upload a file then it did to create it 
len ratingtwo Thank you for wasting my time 
len ratingfive Love It
len ratingfive Very easy
len ratingfive Great app to organize
len ratingfive I love docs 
len ratingfive Cause it helps me keep my stuff organized 
len ratingfive  I ve used the storage app for years 
len ratingfive I pay about month did storage 
len ratingfive Well worth it 
len ratingfive I can easily add and access my files via phone 
len ratingfive Easy to share files as well 
len ratingfive I know of no better 
len ratingtwo I want to see my folders amp files not a Home screen with no option to change 
len ratingtwo This makes Google Drive much less convenient to use regularly 
len ratingfour Sometimes it crashes or slows 
len ratingfour And i ve heard that sheets is not up to excel 
len ratingfour Apart from that mega useful 
len ratingfour Great love for this app 
len ratingfive I operate a small trucking company with our own Authority and I am able with the use of My Drive to convert track send and store all my documents 
len ratingfive Therefore My Drive has been a great support tool for my company 
len ratingfive Thanks My Drive
len ratingfive  I like how anything can be saved to Google Drive and can be easily accessed from anywhere once you login to Google 
len ratingthree  Recently upgraded G Suite account to use Team Drives but quickly found out this app does not provide them to the Files app 
len ratingthree A quick response would be to simply use this app directly but it fails to display many PDF annotations which work fine in the Files App or Google Drive on the web 
len ratingtwo Messy and confusing 
len ratingtwo Older version was a better choice 
len ratingone Ever since the update it will NOT let me download my files for offline view 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone no thanks
len ratingone I don t like it defaults to recent every time you open the app 
len ratingone Sensitive documents are open for everyone to see 
len ratingtwo Don t like this feature please remove 
len ratingone This is a bad app thank you very much
len ratingtwo Bueno no buen simo 
len ratingone  Open a pdf file and I don t see any option to search through it as claimed by the app 
len ratingfour Trying to upload videos from my phone to the Drive and it either takes forever or it doesn t happen at all 
len ratingfour Only had success with two videoed that uploaded as they should and quickly and painlessly 
len ratingfour The rest of the Drive is good 
len ratingone This update is nice but super unintuitive that the default screen is forced upon us without choice 
len ratingone Allow us to pick the default opening screen for the app and place that option in the settings menu 
len ratingone That will earn the remaining stars 
len ratingone Don t complicate what doesn t need to be complicated 
len ratingfive To make better for us to play games on
len ratingone Very bad not friendly possessive can t transfer to many common programs or standard photo storage 
len ratingfive If you are considering using cloud storage Google Drive is the way to go 
len ratingfive It is a quick and efficient place to store photos videos documents presentations spreadsheets and so much more without taking that much space 
len ratingfive Would totally recommend this to anyone all ages and to use for any purpose 
len ratingfive I had to delete the app and re download it to see the new design as downloading it with the previous update installed did nothing 
len ratingone Please go back to the previous version 
len ratingone This is the worst upgrade by far 
len ratingone Layout is horrible 
len ratingtwo This new update is crap the old layout was better switch back please
len ratingfour I use to have a password on my phone app to get into the app 
len ratingfour I want that back Otherwise I love it Thanks
len ratingone I have to physically search for my folders as they are no longer at the top of my homepage 
len ratingthree From both a value and usability standpoint
len ratingone The app was perfect before 
len ratingone It is used to store my files 
len ratingone Why would you change it so that when I open the app I have to now tap on the bottom right to go to my files 
len ratingone  Update is 
len ratingfive  Better than anything 
len ratingone Can t access files 
len ratingone It says something went wrong 
len ratingone Please try again 
len ratingone This is a major headache
len ratingone Every time I use the Google app on my iPhone such as Gmail this one being Google drive and Google docs and Google slides all I get is errors and bounced emails that didn t send and sometimes even corrupted files 
len ratingone So I have nothing but bad experiences with this line of apps 
len ratingone While it may be a problem on my end it certainly doesn t change the fact that I ve had a horrible experience and I haven t been able to share documents for class and it s just been a huge impediment to my work 
len ratingone Why can I not pull up pdf files 
len ratingone  What happened to my Google Drive 
len ratingone Everything was working smoothly before this update 
len ratingone Now my photos won t load fast at all 
len ratingone NOT with internet access or LTE 
len ratingone And I no longer get a bar at the bottom letting me know how many pictures I ve uploaded 
len ratingone I only get a black bar that reads Uploads are pending It no longer reads of pictures pending PLEASE FIX IT 
len ratingtwo I was under the impression that the Drive app was just all the other Google Drive powered apps rolled into one but the Drive app is only for viewing and you have to download the other apps in order to edit 
len ratingtwo There s really not much of any point to the Google Drive App if al you can do is look at the stuff in your drive not edit 
len ratingtwo Sometimes my files won t open 
len ratingtwo I m not thrilled about the organization set up either 
len ratingtwo It s easy for files to get lost 
len ratingfive It just shows year Grandpa can do it
len ratingtwo When opening the app it should come up to files like it used to 
len ratingtwo It made is so a little less convenient for little payoff 
len ratingfour  This app is a fantastic idea with fantastic execution 
len ratingfour I absolutely love it 
len ratingfour I ve never even thought of a feature they could add 
len ratingfour Google considered every detail Until now 
len ratingfour There was literally just an update to the interface of the app has drastically changed the update actually was kind of lazy but I think we all saw it coming 
len ratingfour Especially with the new icon set which oh by the way was a way better update than this new interface change 
len ratingfour If you haven t updated yet don t 
len ratingfour Wait for a couple more versions with some slight interface changes to come out 
len ratingone The latest upgrade no longer lets me download my videos 
len ratingtwo My download speed is mbps 
len ratingtwo  gigs have taken more than mins to download and is still downloading 
len ratingfive  Nothing more to say 
len ratingfive I won t use any other cloud storage except iCloud cause I sort of have to on iOS 
len ratingfive Wish there was more free storage like Mega but still Google Drive all the way 
len ratingfive I deal in large audio and video files and my drop box keeps me in my game
len ratingfive Good for schools
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive  I think Google Drive is a great app for school 
len ratingfive I can do lots of projects on this app 
len ratingfive I m very glad I got this 
len ratingfour Tbh I love Google Drive but I can t find a way to lock the app with a password like Dropbox or Mega have 
len ratingfour I would appreciate it if the next update would re introduced this feature 
len ratingfive My heart is in all these pictures 
len ratingfive I m just getting started but so far so good 
len ratingfive I really love using this app it makes everything so darn easy so accessible worried about security here and there but a great app overall 
len ratingthree Update says you can search pdf text but this feature isn t visible
len ratingthree  Can t you get this app an app locking option 
len ratingthree This thing seriously needs an app lock 
len ratingthree We might have some sensitive contents that we want to jide 
len ratingthree An in app lock would be great for it 
len ratingfive IT ACTUALLY JAS ADS BELIEVE OR NOT
len ratingfive Google drive is the easiest and most comprehensive way to transfer and share files within multiple platforms wether you are a mobile user between Android or Apple or desktop user between windows and apple this is the best and most simple solution for you
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingone  Google should stop suppressing legal conservative speech 
len ratingone Google should be broken up 
len ratingfive I use drive for literally everything 
len ratingfive Not just storing material but to complete college papers to create PDF Excel spreadsheets and anything else I can think of 
len ratingfive My only question is how do you imagine a life without it 
len ratingfive Good thing it s not going anywhere 
len ratingfour I really wish to see a password feature preventing anyone using my phone to open my drive 
len ratingfive  Best app in the world
len ratingfive  Extremely useful and convenient
len ratingfive I use docs all the time 
len ratingfive So easy 
len ratingfive This has been invaluable to me 
len ratingfive As a nursing school student organization is key 
len ratingfive In Google Drive I can set up folders by semester classes and audio files 
len ratingfive I can do my homework have it saved as I work it is convenient to return to or retrieve and print 
len ratingfive I am able to easily share files with other classmates which accelerates learning 
len ratingfive Knowing where to find my work has taken that burden off my mind and allowed me to concentrate on becoming a good nurse 
len ratingfive This app is so simple to use and super productive 
len ratingfive I will use it forever 
len ratingfive Really why bother using anything else 
len ratingfive Everything that Microsoft does but better and easier to use 
len ratingfive Nuff said 
len ratingfive Great for organizational purposes 
len ratingfive Works for all age groups 
len ratingfive It is really bad good 
len ratingone I ll start this by saying I am 
len ratingone It tech savy 
len ratingone But I have been having 
len ratingone Trouble sharing tracks to my band and making new files and granting other permission to view
len ratingfive Absolutely awesome
len ratingone Apparently notes are unsupported
len ratingone I like the app but it should have a select all button when it comes to uploading photos 
len ratingone It s a real hassle to click one picture at a time 
len ratingone I put that on my son and I ain t even got a son
len ratingfive I think it is awesome because you can make docs slides and present them
len ratingfive I like
len ratingfour It would be nice if you could download a file directly to this 
len ratingfive  Use it several hours a day for writing and organizing
len ratingfive It good
len ratingone i kept trying to download the same video file for hours and it never got past preparing to export and yeah i turned my phone off and on about times reset my network settings tried to switch to my data and even turned on my personal hotspot still nothing 
len ratingone in fact im writing this review after my rd time trying to redownload this app 
len ratingthree Oh boy another app that I don t want but need 
len ratingthree Thanks Gmail file size constraints 
len ratingone Thanks again Can not open file
len ratingfour Google is amazing it is helpful and creative it is probably the best website ever 
len ratingfive  This app is perfect on the go 
len ratingfive Could use it anywhere
len ratingfour This is a pretty good application I m able to store watch cartoons offline 
len ratingfour Only thing they could add is the option to cast mp files to a TV
len ratingthree Why for example can I not find files that are easy to find on Drive on my iPad but not on my iPhone 
len ratingone Difficult to find what you want directs you to recents while ignoring file hierarchy 
len ratingone You had better know exactly what you labeled your files and where you put them or good luck finding them again 
len ratingone Want to erase the duplicates but can t 
len ratingfour The Google Drive is awesome 
len ratingfour I have saved photos and videos to the drive and have been able to share them with my family 
len ratingfour Excellent
len ratingfive It s so amazing and useful
len ratingone See above 
len ratingfive Great App to save any kind of documents book or any digital stuff 
len ratingfour Great app
len ratingfive The versatility and ability of this drive makes it much better than some others 
len ratingfive Being able to access it from any device and share and or modify when necessary for instant results is really what makes this great for me 
len ratingfive Love Google 
len ratingfive Google drive is awesome for keeping notes that I need in a week or a month because there is no way that I will remember especially important things for kids
len ratingone For some reason when you make a file on google sheets on a device and you save and want to view it from a different device it doesn t show the same colors you made the sheet with 
len ratingone This only happens when viewing the file from a device where the file wasn t created 
len ratingone Other than that works fine
len ratingfour It was fine but I would have liked to Edit my slideshow right away instead of having to download it
len ratingfour Also the links generated automatically are rather large and only suitable for copy pasting and sending directly to another device 
len ratingfour In more than the one instance I ve had use a third party url shortening service to make it easier to send to someone 
len ratingfour Ig would vid nice if the URLs for doors could be customized right off the bat 
len ratingthree Google drawings is not available in my drive 
len ratingfour Ayuda mucho a los trabajos 
len ratingone I love google drive itself but this app is essentially useless 
len ratingone you need other apps to simply edit a file 
len ratingone this app is great if you just want to look at your files
len ratingthree It s ok but it gives me notifications and than it stays there for eternity 
len ratingthree Other than that it s great 
len ratingfive It helps bcs you can work offline
len ratingfive Sooo great 
len ratingfive Works great for school work excellent application
len ratingthree I m not sure if this is just me but I sent an email to myself containing a video and it sent to my google drive I opened it went to share with then hit save video but it isn t saving 
len ratingthree Other than that its good
len ratingthree This is an amazing app 
len ratingthree It has the stuff you gave to your teacher for an example a book review 
len ratingthree It even has the stuff you had from the past years 
len ratingfour So far so good can t complain does what I put in
len ratingfour This app allows adequate storage however it lacks the innovative edge Picassa had 
len ratingfour Come on Google
len ratingfour Google drive is a really good app to keep your data together in one frame 
len ratingfour Certainly it s better than iCloud 
len ratingfour The drawback is it s difficult to arrange folders that you create in drive 
len ratingfive Por el momento no tengo ninguna queja y trabaja muy bien por el momento 
len ratingfive It just makes life easy 
len ratingfive  You can hear offline music and work on projects faster pls add a mp converter and offline youtube to add songs pls much faster caues i have to do computer process the entire time 
len ratingfive Drive is so helpful especially since my school is google supported we do everything through google classrooms and it s so easy to organize and access data from different devices
len ratingthree  When i got on a website i go there no problem but when I click on my google drive icon and try to click on a picture it keep saying im offline pls help
len ratingfive If the answer is yes you are a Gucci person if the answer is no u should dab on them haters and call them all plebs 
len ratingfive Join the rebellion we Stan for Moto Moto 
len ratingfive Like and subscribe and leave your comments down below 
len ratingfive Sincerely your mom
len ratingfive Our school uses google drive classroom docs slides very frequently 
len ratingfive It never crashed or glitched on me 
len ratingfive Overall good performance 
len ratingfive Zoo we mama
len ratingfive I m honestly just copying this review off of someone else s IGN
len ratingfive This app is amazing
len ratingone So when you view a video on the drive you basically have to close the application to get out and look at another one Dx
len ratingfive Good drive is a very neat clean fast and handy 
len ratingfive Without it I couldn t share my longer videos with my friends or on my social media s 
len ratingfive It s great for many other things but I use it to get my elgato clips to my phone and the quality it uploads in is beautiful 
len ratingfive  stars from me 
len ratingone I shared a folder 
len ratingone Then at a later date deleted permissions for the other person 
len ratingone However I cannot remove the folder or even rename it AT ALL 
len ratingone That is just one of the many bugs with Google Drive that Google developers tech support have not fixed in years apparently judging from the back dates of numerous complaints 
len ratingone They need to integrate the Docs Spread sheets and Slides into the google drive for instant edits without the need of another application it would make it super convenient 
len ratingone As a student its way better that way 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive So i have to use google docs a lot in school and the app really helps me cause I forget to bring my laptop to school a lot so if I have my phone with me I can just use my phone to edit my docs instead 
len ratingthree You need to download like apps to be able to do everything 
len ratingtwo Cannot share folders
len ratingfive  This is so cool to be able to keep your pictures to show you guys the phone laptop and tablet 
len ratingfive Loving This
len ratingfive This is literally a most have on your phone it works amazingly for pretty much everything
len ratingone Tell me why when I m a folder and I search for a file by name or type or both I get results from my entire Drive 
len ratingone Why in those results can t I organize by file name 
len ratingone I ve tried 
len ratingone Why can t I see size of contents of folder 
len ratingone Deficient 
len ratingone How about no u
len ratingfive Great product 
len ratingfive I m the full time assistant to a high production realtor 
len ratingfive My job would be verrrry difficult without the convenience and user friendliness of google drive 
len ratingfive I recommend it to colleagues often 
len ratingfive Me encanta usar este app para subir y compartir mis archivos con otras personas de una marea f cil y r pida 
len ratingfive Great Drive
len ratingfour Good but needs to be combined with draw and docs as well
len ratingfive Oof
len ratingfive Yes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yesYes yes yes yes
len ratingtwo Q seems harder to view pictures
len ratingtwo I can never figure out where to put things for someone else that needs to see them 
len ratingtwo It s very confusing 
len ratingtwo I have to use this for homeschooling and I really am not a google product person 
len ratingtwo I don t know how use the joint calendar and make it so everyone sees the same thing there either and I never have issues when I am using my Apple products 
len ratingtwo So now I have all these files uploaded and am individually sending them or sharing with someone else 
len ratingtwo Why can t I share it all with one click 
len ratingtwo I don t find it user friendly unless you already know what to do 
len ratingthree It would be nice to see the Items that failed to download over wifi dure to internet outages or connectivity failure Besides that app is great unless your screen is broken in which turns off even when settings are set otherwise 
len ratingfour It is so handy to have quick access to all my drive files but as I store more and more data here it just becomes unwieldy 
len ratingfour Searching for keywords has never been a method for organization 
len ratingfive Does it really need a review 
len ratingfive It s an indispensable tool 
len ratingfour Can access the app from anywhere
len ratingfive I am beyond impressed with google drive 
len ratingfive I ve been using this application for a couple of years 
len ratingfive The point that really overpowers other apps 
len ratingfive Is they have infinite space and different formats for organizing 
len ratingfive Another reason why they prevail 
len ratingfive Amongst phones and apps is because everything is under one umbrella google 
len ratingfive I don t have a reason that my most valuable and personal information will get lost 
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive My kids use it
len ratingfive This is really good for checking on my projects when I m not at my computer
len ratingfive I love this app because my 
len ratingfive Friends makes books and we can send each other something and it s just cool by Cynthia lol
len ratingthree Google drive is fairly good but uploading takes a very long time especially for videos 
len ratingfive Gay
len ratingfive  Google Photos is a great app for Google 
len ratingfive  Msmdmdemnemwlkfkrkkrkekqlllskmxncbchfjkkkdklwskkskajdjbfbfhf 
len ratingfive C est cool 
len ratingfive  I think that this was one of the best apps I ve ever used on my iPod touch 
len ratingfour I m an elementary school teacher and we use google drive to share lessons 
len ratingfour On a computer I can open these files but the google drive Apple app does not open these smart notebook files to view
len ratingthree Almost everything about Google Drive is awesome 
len ratingthree I think the only thing that takes away from this app and the others in the Google Suite is that it doesn t let you do all the same things you can do from a desktop or laptop computer 
len ratingthree For example it doesn t allow you to attach videos from the drive to Google Slides 
len ratingthree You need a desktop or laptop to do that 
len ratingthree Not sure why they see the need to limit what can be done from a mobile device within the app or apps 
len ratingthree I think we should be able use all the features no matter the device you re using 
len ratingthree It s very frustrating at times when you re trying to get work done then you run into something like that and need to switch devices 
len ratingtwo OK online but can t get my files folders to show up in the computer s desktop Google Drive folder 
len ratingtwo And when I have large volumes it takes way too long and seems to crash a lot 
len ratingtwo Then I don t know if all the files uploaded 
len ratingtwo Update 
len ratingtwo Tried to find a file using the app in my iPhone but nothing was in alphabetical order 
len ratingtwo I got it in alpha order in one section and opened the file 
len ratingtwo When I went back to see another file in the same folder nothing was in order again 
len ratingtwo I d like it to look like my file system so I know where things are 
len ratingfive I love how easy it is to create a folder and share it 
len ratingfive I work with a lot of huge files and documents that would costs a fortune to print and organize 
len ratingfive Super necessary for every student
len ratingfive This app works exactly like it states no mysteries here 
len ratingfive Fast efficient connection to your Google Drive over a mobile device 
len ratingfive Functionality is exactly like sitting in front of your computer 
len ratingfive Google has delivered a very seamless cloud drive connection for mobile through this app 
len ratingfour It s such a nice app to have especially when you need to look at something in your drive and you don t want to login into your account 
len ratingfour It s super convenient and it s just nice to have 
len ratingfive Google 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I want to thank you for google 
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfour Only issue I ve really had is it keeps deleting downloaded content 
len ratingfour Aside from that the app functions as it s supposed to and gets the job done for my uses documents and photos mainly 
len ratingfour The prompt asking me if I d like to review the app took me too the iTunes Store instead of the AppStore so that s a slight problem but just a redirection error 
len ratingfour Besides all that great app 
len ratingfive Google has generously made my storage convenient 
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfive Now I can find my files at any time 
len ratingfive This app really helps me 
len ratingfive And I love it 
len ratingfive One of the most if not the most important tool I used while in college 
len ratingfive It gave the ability to have access to all of my class assignments and documents anywhere and anytime using the app and my mobile hotspot 
len ratingone in case you ve been living under a rock or like most people you need a rock dropped on your head to snap you out of the apathy and indifference to the truth staring you in the face that will undoubtedly soon spell your doom for the past decade or so here s a tip there s no such thing as rape culture white privilege transgender or google 
len ratingone Google is actually spelled SKYNET and it already owns the bulk of what you believe is your life 
len ratingone think I m a nut job on a conspiracy rant 
len ratingone Understandable yet still no excuse for allowing groupthink to dictate the basis of your opinions 
len ratingone word 
len ratingfive My goto drive for everything
len ratingfive Can t live without it 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfour Helpful
len ratingtwo This update broke files support and now it doesn t work in the IOS files app
len ratingfive The app is A great way to do my homework
len ratingfive This is app is helpful
len ratingfive I use this for storing important data for my business 
len ratingfive If I need to look up some info pertaining to the biz it s right there 
len ratingone Still can t create a file using third party apps and the Files system 
len ratingone It s just broken 
len ratingone This works fine with Box OneDrive Dropbox etc 
len ratingone Extension support is generally very poor 
len ratingone For instance when I download a file in Safari the only way to copy it to Drive actually opens the Drive app 
len ratingone Again unlike Dropbox which just pops opens little box without switching me around 
len ratingone Plus with the unreliable Mac sync you may as well save yourself some heartburn and just use Dropbox 
len ratingfive I use google drive for all of my school work and I have never had a complaint 
len ratingfive It is easy to use organize and create documents 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive It keeps all of google creations sorted and organized 
len ratingfive Now with drive i know where everything is and I am so much more organized
len ratingfive It works that s all I need to say 
len ratingfive This app makes it exceedingly easy to keep all of my important files in one place and to access on the go 
len ratingfive Also syncs between devices with ease 
len ratingfive I use it pretty much every day 
len ratingfive  I m sorry
len ratingtwo The app is MB in size 
len ratingtwo That s outrageous 
len ratingtwo There is no reason such a simple app needs to be so large and Google should be more respectful of the limited space on people s mobile devices than to expect all that space for themselves 
len ratingthree If you guys start doing the pass code setup again it ll be really helpful thanks
len ratingfive It s is good because it can help when you doing homework and if you are doing something and don t have a computer you can use this 
len ratingfive  ABbythgf
len ratingone Give us a clear easy to find download button for our pictures videos without having to dig through the menus to find it bring back the security feature with the passcode lock Face ID or Touch ID 
len ratingone Something 
len ratingone I want to cancel my premium account switch to dropbox since yall refuse to give paying customers what they are asking for 
len ratingfive Fast link 
len ratingone  Be aware once you reach to the limit space that you have in your google drive you will not receive any messages in your gmail account until you erase some files from your google drive 
len ratingone I lost a lots of importants email during last month 
len ratingone very dissapointed
len ratingfive Wonderful app thanks
len ratingfive I use this app to create k pop slideshows to show my love for certain things 
len ratingfive BTS BLACKPINK NCT REDVELVET
len ratingfive At school google drive is such a great replacement for iCloud 
len ratingfive No limitation and you can upload videos from your phone 
len ratingfive I love google drive it s definitely amazing 
len ratingfive I use it for projects nonstop 
len ratingone  Subscribeto evan seal everything
len ratingone It doesn t work well on my iPhone or iPad it s always a struggle
len ratingone Gay is gay Google drive is gay Gay is google drive Yay
len ratingfive I don t have to be stressed about where the one file is because they are all in my drive 
len ratingone I does not let me edit some stuff
len ratingone Being a music artist has its ups and downs 
len ratingone One of the downs is trying to send large files 
len ratingone Can t wait for G
len ratingfive  Great app never miss a thing from photos to documents everything conveniently stored in one place in my opinion nothing could ever replace google drive 
len ratingfive With a team of eight people and all of us with different schedules this tool allows us to collaborate on a level that keeps us working together on our project work 
len ratingfive Easy to setup and maintain for the whole group 
len ratingone They sucked it deleted my page essay that was due in days would give stars if were an option
len ratingfive Great for organization and convenience 
len ratingfive very useful tool to move around key files storage long term and quick access scenarios and the accessibility of the platform getting your data where it needs to go to who it needs to go is a snappy process thanks to the adept structure and useful features it can provide to articulate most any kind of task and all in an initiative layout that Google is famous for 
len ratingfive thanks Google drive is an awesome addition to the software utilities mostly because it s built the way it should be a useful tool that gives us conceptual function that just works 
len ratingfive Perfect app for organizing all drive files just as good as online version 
len ratingtwo isn t letting me upload my videos at all to my drive 
len ratingtwo it ll keep saying Retrying over and over again and then after a minute or so it will say it failed to upload 
len ratingtwo I ve tried everything from restarting my phone redownloading the app trying data instead of wifi and still nothing works 
len ratingtwo Uploading photos works but uploading my videos was the main reason i got the app therefore I m very disappointed 
len ratingone It s not good enough
len ratingfive When I lost my phone I couldn t get into my iCloud and Google drive had everything from my old phone and it backed up to my new one even contacts pics 
len ratingfive This app give trachers and students a chance to have freedom do what every you want only think is you should be able to get to google on classlink but I love this app and this is going to be the best once I use it as a teacher 
len ratingone The End
len ratingfive This is a good drive because you can basically upload almost anything and it has GB free storage 
len ratingfive I think I Will use it to back up my screen recordings so they don t hog up my space on my iPad 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive No s a qu se debe pero pasa lo de la inestabilidad y entonces no resulta f cil escribir 
len ratingfive Agradezco que en lo posible logren solucionar este inconveniente 
len ratingfive Gracias
len ratingone I use Google drive as a way to save images which I can share on social media later 
len ratingone But that has become a pain since I can t even see a preview of images when I open a folder that contains the images 
len ratingone All I see is this default image icon 
len ratingone Even when I select an image to open it takes FOREVER for the image to load 
len ratingone Competitor apps like Dropbox works perfectly all the time so I know it has nothing to do with my internet speed 
len ratingone And considering that I ve been sending feedback about this for over a year and it s progressively gotten worse I guess it s time to abandon Drive once and for all 
len ratingthree I upload an audio file every week so I can get it from iPad to pc 
len ratingthree Never had a problem 
len ratingthree Now when I go to access the file in Drive to download to a different folder for further processing it wouldn t download 
len ratingthree Got stuck somewhere 
len ratingthree I ended up having to use Dropbox 
len ratingthree Get with it Google 
len ratingthree When updating you re not supposed to break it 
len ratingone google drive is very behind and had not updated in several months 
len ratingone i m unable to get to my most recent documents
len ratingthree I really like Google Drive but feel it could be more user friendly 
len ratingtwo I save to drive 
len ratingtwo And cannot move to docs 
len ratingtwo My lack of education but am upset after weeks of trying 
len ratingfive Productivity excels for us when using Drive 
len ratingfive So convenient to have all access and sharing between our devices and it s so fast compared to the others 
len ratingone Can you add a setting to let people download unsupported files please
len ratingone I want my pictures off of OneDrive and put on my computer 
len ratingone I do not understand how to remove pictures off one drive but it keeps telling me it s full 
len ratingone I don t want them here but I don t want to lose my pictures 
len ratingone It tells me if I delete from OneDrive it will delete from all my devices 
len ratingone I don t like this 
len ratingone Why are all my pictures documents automatically going to one drive 
len ratingone On iPhone X and I just want to download my video to my phone 
len ratingone At minutes now trying to figure this out and the video player crashes on a mb mov file 
len ratingone Drag and drop select feature is way too touchy 
len ratingone Stick to Dropbox everyone 
len ratingfour Can t download PDFs to iBooks anymore from my phone 
len ratingfour Fix this and it would be great thanks 
len ratingthree I like the fact that I can post large videos from google drive to instagram through my phone but I don t like how it takes away many of the controls from instagram such as the option to crop the video or not 
len ratingthree For a better user experience it should export videos more easily to instagram so the user can have IG s full editing tagging options 
len ratingthree It would be best if there were an option on instagram to open your google drive
len ratingfive Sweet application
len ratingfive Nice like that it s easy to use and very user friendly
len ratingfive Thanks drive
len ratingfive Very good experience great having information at my finger tips 
len ratingone  Give us a clear easy to find download button for our pictures videos without having to dig through the menus to find it bring back the security feature with the passcode lock Face ID or Touch ID 
len ratingone Something 
len ratingone I want to cancel my premium account switching to dropbox if you can give paying customers what they asking for 
len ratingone I shouldn t have to worry about the safety of all my files when others are using my phone 
len ratingfive Muy f cil de utilizar para el proyecto de mi hija 
len ratingfive Gracias
len ratingfive  Smells good like my pet hdjeudhdjr
len ratingtwo Je ne suis pas contente car sur mon t l phone je l ouvre normalement mais sur mon pc il ne fonctionne plus 
len ratingtwo Je ne peux ni t l charger mes fichiers ni voir mes docs pr c dents 
len ratingtwo Veuillez r gler ce probl me le plus t t possible
len ratingfive I appreciate the compatibility with mobile devices 
len ratingfive And that is accessible from email windows on them 
len ratingfive I would love to see iMessage app for iOS
len ratingone The constant reminders to review the app are really annoying
len ratingfive It s helpful
len ratingfour Would be star but needs password protection 
len ratingfive Awesome platform 
len ratingfive Google Docs has made my life tremendously functional 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingtwo It s very slow I m unable to open the document and it simply says no connection while connection is pretty much available 
len ratingone I used Google Drive to upload videos I create because the files are too large to save any other way to share them 
len ratingone The issue is whenever I go to watch a video to make sure it s playing correctly I m trapped on that screen and can t get out of it 
len ratingone The x on the top left when tapped just turns into a double sided arrow and when you tap that it turns into an x again 
len ratingone It becomes a never ending loop and I have to completely close out the app to view anything else in my drive 
len ratingone The features are great otherwise but seeing as this is my primary use it s almost useless to have 
len ratingone I have to end up saving them to my phone to watch them but if that s the case I could just upload them to the cloud and save myself the trouble 
len ratingfive Great way to store stuff across devices 
len ratingfive This is a amazing app because I m on my iPad and I can t do ANYTHING without drive 
len ratingfive And by the way I love that there is no bugs or glitches Meeeeee
len ratingfive really helpful and handy to have for school 
len ratingfive everything is saved everywhere and saves me a heart attack or two when i need to print send things for school 
len ratingthree There s a bug with exporting videos 
len ratingthree I like everything else though 
len ratingthree Google please fix that bug I can t do anything if I can t download things off of google drive 
len ratingfive Google drive is one of the best tool ever that I have used and using 
len ratingfour I gave it stars because of the password option that was removed 
len ratingfour This used to be one of my favorite apps when it had the password option 
len ratingfour Can u bring it back 
len ratingfive Google Drive allows me to be mobile 
len ratingfive I have everything with me all the time 
len ratingfive I also back up my devices 
len ratingfive I m able to share files and collaborate with others 
len ratingfive Really good i use it for school it s amazing
len ratingone Weird
len ratingfive Love google drive 
len ratingfive Perfect for keeping all your documents and other items completely organized 
len ratingfive Honestly I cannot imagine my daily life without it s easy access and flawless organization 
len ratingfive Totally recommend for anyone who uses Google Docs Slides Sheets etc 
len ratingfive Using Google Drive will definitely make your life easier 
len ratingtwo You can t edit any documents unless you get the docs app so there is no point in installing this app just gets the docs one 
len ratingtwo I m not sure why you made this but then you need other apps to be able to edit anything 
len ratingtwo Same with slides you can t edit unless you get the slides app so just avoid this app and get the ones you need 
len ratingone I m slow I can t seem to figure out how to auto play or shuffle my music and a lot more problems with my iPhone not what I expected my phone was hacked and my screen has broken twice and I can t play my music like I want 
len ratingone Google drive crashes as I am trying to edit documents 
len ratingone It happens especially when I need to select a word or section 
len ratingone This very frustrating and waste a tremendous amount of time 
len ratingone Google you usually make good products even to be compatible with Apple 
len ratingone What s the deal 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP
len ratingfive Can t live without it it has never failed me in anyway 
len ratingfive The application is 
len ratingtwo You need to upload faster and download file to camera roll faster 
len ratingtwo I been sitting video that seconds long and waited like minute just to download it to camera roll 
len ratingfive Loving the google drive 
len ratingfive You get GB free 
len ratingfive Not only that downloading makes the progress perfect 
len ratingfive I downloaded over songs that are longer than minutes and still 
len ratingfive It CHARGED NO MONEY 
len ratingfive This was a very useful app 
len ratingfive U used it for school cause I could download PDF files and study at home without all the loose papers 
len ratingfive I recommend this app to anyone 
len ratingfour Can it add subtitles function on the app 
len ratingone I m frantically tapping at the screen and trying my damndest to get something time sensitive done and this app made by google of all multi billion dollar industries decides its a good time to ask me to leave it a glowing review like its some desperate indie app 
len ratingone Cut this nonsense out 
len ratingfour Summary Google drive is a free app that lets you store files in the cloud 
len ratingfour If you are like me and have multiple devices and can t keep track of your documents this app is great 
len ratingfour Pros Free Synced to your email Goes great with other Google Widgets Works on your Phone Cons Not the tightest security 
len ratingfour Some Documents types don t translate well Google is Skynet
len ratingfive  Like it
len ratingone Why can t I access google forms on google drive 
len ratingone I can t create new forms or even view old forms 
len ratingone Completely unhelpful app 
len ratingfive I think that the website has more capability but on the go the app is excellent to sort and manage items in your drive 
len ratingfive Love the use of filters 
len ratingfive Great product 
len ratingthree Need password as before
len ratingtwo I can t share anything 
len ratingtwo The app freezes whenever I try to share a document with someone
len ratingfive I love goggle drive because I know where all my important writings are 
len ratingfive  It is sooooooo easy to use and just a great app over all 
len ratingfive I definitely recommend this application on a phone I pad or anywhere 
len ratingfour  This app works really well and I have no complaints about the app itself 
len ratingfour I have to use it for work so that s the only reason I have it 
len ratingfour I took off one star because it is Google 
len ratingfour I try to keep as little personal information stored in the Drive since everything is subject to their bots scanning for keywords so that they can determine how to advertise to you and selling your info to whoever might be interested in buying it 
len ratingfour Google has absolutely no respect for your privacy despite what they say 
len ratingfour They ve been fined by the FCC FTC European Union and other groups for all of the illegal things they ve done 
len ratingfour So use their apps carefully
len ratingone Works like garbage on iOS
len ratingone Highly dysfunctional too many bugs to count really
len ratingtwo I would give this stars if it had all of the same functionality as the web 
len ratingtwo Latest one I noticed was that link sharing with people outside of your Google Apps organization is not an option 
len ratingfive Easy to work with and share even for someone with limited tech savvy
len ratingfive Y all are doing a pretty job 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingone The requirement to make all viewers have a Google account is ambitious but self defeating 
len ratingone I you 
len ratingone will never remember ALL the people with whom you want to share a doc 
len ratingone If I want to open a doc to the world so be it 
len ratingone Way to lose market share big G 
len ratingfive Gdyfyfufhfhfhffhfhfhfhfdeghfhcyfuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuusall
len ratingfive I wasn t familiar with google drive using it in my work place has showed me how easily everything could be accessible 
len ratingfive That s why I m rating it a five star 
len ratingfive I have been using it everyday for a decade 
len ratingfive This has been an indispensable resource for me 
len ratingfive The cloud service works seamlessly across all my platforms iPhone MacBook chrome book kindle fire iPad PC and at every other device I ve used 
len ratingfive The app specifically has all the functionality of the full website once you download the related apps that match the file types you use Sheets Docs etc and I love being able to print remotely to my home printer using cloud print 
len ratingfive UPDATE it s been another year or two 
len ratingfive Still love it
len ratingone Can t open the file 
len ratingone Keeps on roaming 
len ratingone Theyre manu files that unsopported
len ratingthree Video downloads just need to load up a bit faster and be ready to use ASAP 
len ratingone Horrendously slow 
len ratingone Super disappointed
len ratingfive Great App with continuing improvement to meet professional and educational needs
len ratingthree I love drive for the most part 
len ratingthree I like how quick and neatly you can organize your stuff in folders 
len ratingthree The one disappointing thing is that I tried moving many of my previous word documents into drive but drive doesn t convert them so that they look the same 
len ratingthree The formatting is a bit off 
len ratingthree I wonder if this is something that can be fixed in the future 
len ratingthree They are so close but OCD people like me will spend countless hours trying to fix the formatting 
len ratingfive No review
len ratingfive So far Google Drive has been good 
len ratingfive I have it on my phone and email 
len ratingfive And whenever I change my email it request to update my google drive too 
len ratingfour  This is a great app but it would be better if it had an app lock feature then I would give it five stars 
len ratingfive I simply love using Google drive the transitioning from android to apple using this app has made everything much easier for me thank you google 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive It is so great for keeping your work and info 
len ratingfive I love using it 
len ratingfive Google drive is now one of my favorite apps 
len ratingfive I love the reliability and availability of this product even the free version includes gigs
len ratingfive What would I do without it 
len ratingfive I love that I can store all of my documents in a secure cloud that is easily accessible from anywhere in the world 
len ratingfive I love that this cloud is closely linked and integrated to my phone email docs and photos making it quick and easy to utilize on the run 
len ratingfive It s nice to know that my documents easy to retrieve and safe from individual computer accidents 
len ratingfive As a musician uploading to Google Drive is possibly one of my best decisions I ve made being able to record and save my files to Google drive has been great 
len ratingfive At my fingertips I m able to share onto many different platforms to reach many different fans all over the world 
len ratingfive Amazing fast accessible
len ratingtwo  Still can t create a file using third party apps and the Files system 
len ratingtwo It s just broken 
len ratingtwo Plus with the unreliable Mac sync you may as well save yourself some heartburn and just use Dropbox 
len ratingone Google Drive used to be good SW 
len ratingone But because they won t devote adequate processing power think CPUs to reformatting your uploaded video for optimal storage an hour later a min video shot on iPhone still says processing 
len ratingone Add Googles privacy abuse like most large do no evil Corps and you d be better off to just stay away 
len ratingfive This app is good for school and gamers especially ninja
len ratingone Make the search or find available 
len ratingone Airplay doesn t work for videos 
len ratingone Can t close videos that are being played the UI element to close videos appears to be broken 
len ratingone Incredibly annoying
len ratingone Don t like apps that take a lot of storage for a seemingly simple task 
len ratingone I use it only because it s the only game in town 
len ratingfour I m so far from tech savvy 
len ratingfour I m not a total idiot 
len ratingfour When it comes to smartphones laptops however thestruggleisreal 
len ratingfour I m just having a hard time with drives photos folders I ll figure it out 
len ratingone This is not a good app u can t edit don t get it in less u absolutly have to
len ratingone Typical google errors and bugs 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingthree Google Drive is honestly better on the computer but it still is good 
len ratingfive I used my Google Drive everyday 
len ratingfive It is so convenient to have access to my files anywhere anytime 
len ratingone I can t believe that I can no longer download more than one photo off google drive anymore 
len ratingone I have to go through all the aggravation of downloading them one by one now 
len ratingone Very disappointed in this and google 
len ratingone I will no longer be using google drive on my iPhone any more 
len ratingone Very displeased 
len ratingthree Way to slow uploading idk if it s my phone or y all service 
len ratingone Not even showing me the full size images to upload
len ratingone Taking a lot longer to upload files and it is saying the sharing link doesn t work or is incorrect please fix 
len ratingthree I can t log out of my account
len ratingtwo Does not work with Procreate App which is a huge reason I need an online shareable drive 
len ratingfive I prefer and think it s a better value and better product choice for Apple Mac OS iOS systems 
len ratingfive Google offers more storage and I think it s more reliable and you get more bang for your buck but since all my operating systems and apps i prefer and are with Apple ICloud Storage and iOS and MacOS had both but for what i use I m gonna have to go with ICloud from Apple 
len ratingfive  Easy to use especially with zip files
len ratingfive  please include Face ID or Touch ID to unlock photo 
len ratingfive What else can I say 
len ratingfive Works seamlessly for work and leisure purposes 
len ratingfive Thank you very much
len ratingfive Thai is a great tool in this Modern generation but we from previous generation Are able to use it 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Imprescindible para el manejo cotidiano de muchos archivos
len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfour Can you guys who MAINTAIN the app put numbers in numerical order back under the files so I can know how pics I have of my wife to be 
len ratingfour She was really impressed when I told her I kept all five hundred of the pics she sent 
len ratingfour It s probably fifteen hundred now but it s no way of knowing exactly how many unless I count each one on my own 
len ratingfour WHO HAS TIME FOR THAT MAN 
len ratingfour Please please please please please please please please please please Google Drive Maintenance Gods help a player keep playing right and let s get some numerical order on the files 
len ratingfour I m sure everyone else will appreciate it too 
len ratingtwo Search functionality poor
len ratingfive Yup u bet boyz
len ratingone If I ever want to loose something I put it in drive 
len ratingfive Would like more options on google docs Fonts and page boarders
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingthree I use this for practice The way it is is neat or organized This is good for storing daily information
len ratingfive Easy peasy
len ratingfive  It s all good 
len ratingfive Google drive helps me a lot with school and work and my personal life plus my future and past life what I did or what I am going to do 
len ratingfive Better than acrobat reader Document Cloud
len ratingone ITS DOO DOO
len ratingfive Google dive is so awesome
len ratingfive Ok so basically momky
len ratingfive excellent i hope to add more service to their subscription so i will subscribe
len ratingone None of the photos I transferred to here from my computer are showing up in my drive 
len ratingone And it doesn t edit videos Can I please have my back 
len ratingone no option to simply sign out of account 
len ratingone Only gives the option to switch accounts

len ratingfive So cool
len ratingfive Has worked great for years for me with little to no problems Great job

len ratingfive Love this app great for staff info sharing and projects
len ratingfive Google drive mixed with google docs is great 
len ratingfive My buddies and I have been working on a project and it makes it soooo easy 
len ratingfive Upload it to the drive and share it with the others and everyone can add their input and edit changes 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Working like a charm
len ratingfive In drive you can collaborate with others on the same document 
len ratingfive You can create the same kinds of documents as in Word but can access them anytime and anywhere that you have WiFi 
len ratingfive You can save a work in progress and revisit it later without loss because drive saves as you work 
len ratingone It s poop
len ratingfive The convenience of this app is amazing 
len ratingfive I use it on the go 
len ratingthree I like it but it takes for ever to get something from imovie
len ratingtwo This is very unsafe i can t believe google did this please give us a reliable app

len ratingfive Drives the bombdigity
len ratingfive This app has been a lifesaver 
len ratingfive I use it every day for sending links to my children and grandchildren 
len ratingfive For a special calendar I made for Christmas 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately the passcode to access the app was removed during an update 
len ratingtwo Considering consumers concerns about privacy and controlling access it just seems counterproductive to remove such a security feature 
len ratingtwo Please bring it back 
len ratingthree Has great potential 
len ratingtwo  It s and Google STILL does not offer any app security options for Drive 
len ratingtwo The app for my GARAGE DOOR offers PIN and FACEID 
len ratingtwo Come on Google 
len ratingfive Even on an iPhone the app works seamlessly to store and share files 
len ratingfive Integrates with all other productivity apps 
len ratingfive Intuitive to use 
len ratingfive Monopolies aren t all bad 
len ratingfive I love it helps us throw every thing 
len ratingfive This app is the best 
len ratingone It won t let me upload photota
len ratingfive I save songs directly on my phone when I m on the train or offline working and I love that I can be in drive and docs at the same time so I can listen to songs and look at lyrics at the same 
len ratingfive Thank you for helping me get my songwriting done faster and more efficiently and from anywhere 
len ratingfour I share notes with classmates review in my car and save homework assignments with my google drive 
len ratingfour The app isn t as easy to maneuver as website accessed through a laptop but the app is very convenient and useful tool that everyone should be able to navigate and understand 
len ratingfive We love google drive me and my kids use it a lot my kids do a lot of school work that involved this app 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone I can t seem to download any video that I need to 
len ratingone I
len ratingfive Elle me permet de stocker mes dossiers importants 
len ratingfive I works for what I need it to do 
len ratingfive Pretty intuitive layout and has proved helpful for a variety of tasks 
len ratingone When I open it to photos there are stange photos that I NEVER TOOK 
len ratingtwo I don t understand if I have google drive which has all of my documents why I have to download multiple apps to be able to edit the items that are in the drive 
len ratingtwo Doesn t make sense to me
len ratingone Idk i avoid google drive at home and work because it is hard for me to stay organized 
len ratingfive I love the fact if you fill your allotted amount of gigs you can use other emails 
len ratingfive Better layout than Dropbox
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone Doesn t work
len ratingfive Great backup system still trying to learn more about how to use it 
len ratingfive Great for saving all your important stuff 
len ratingfive Whenever you need it just login to your account an it will pop up
len ratingfive It only has one viewing mode and I have to transfer files if I want to view differently 
len ratingfive Great and easy way to organize and store my pics 
len ratingfive It s really easy to look for stuff and organized 
len ratingfive I love not having to carry my laptop around 
len ratingfive I can reach my drive on my iPhone 
len ratingfive As a small business we use G suite G drive enables us to share collaborate and print from nearly any location
len ratingfive  nemli t m evraklar m dosyalamama gerek kalmadan burada muhafaza edebiliyorum 
len ratingfive Ger ekten Harika bir uygulama 
len ratingfive Te ekk rler
len ratingfive Could not survive in business without GDrive
len ratingfour This is a great clean app that is easy to manage and makes organization simple 
len ratingfour However they did delete the passcode fingerprint security protection which takes away from privacy which would be nice for have again 
len ratingfour Interest
len ratingone Nothing but issues purchased more space still having problems everyone I talk the same thing Google needs to step up 
len ratingone It ya difficult to find files and docs stored
len ratingfour I think that google drive is very helpful especially for me because I always have a lot of homework on google drive 
len ratingfour and I usually have to go somewhere and since I can get it on my iphone I can do my homework while I am out 
len ratingfive We ve been using Google Drive as a key repository since 
len ratingfive And it s always been up available and fast 
len ratingfive The Preview feature rocks 
len ratingfive And Chrome integration MAC apps and cloud distribution makes it infinitely scalable 
len ratingfive We also use Chromebooks in our office and that allows for quite a bit of ease in terms of simple integration 
len ratingfive A must have if you are a growing team and need collaboration markup and storage 
len ratingfive For a month it s quite the value as well 
len ratingfive  Yes
len ratingfive Google drive allows me to store share and collaborate on documents and data easily and intuitively 
len ratingfive It helps keeps your stuff organized and for some things I have an app that you need to like scan a piece of paper for and he can help me like sort them by certain categories that I like so it s pretty cool and I d give it a five star rating and I think you should too so that s why I think it s a good idea for you to get the app
len ratingfive I love this app it s so organized and easy to use 
len ratingfive Highly reccomend 
len ratingfive This is one of the st centuries great tools 
len ratingfour Big inconvenience maybe i missed the option for it but others are experiencing this issue on the app

len ratingthree Thx 
len ratingtwo It seems so useful then you get bombarded by confused clients asking for access to the files you sent to them

len ratingtwo Very annoying extra step
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfour I experienced using good for me
len ratingfive I am overjoyed that you make it possible to store videos and photos and other documents in an easy to access place

len ratingfive Quick efficient and easy document management 
len ratingthree This app was ok but it didn t let me edit on my IPad it only let me view 
len ratingfive This keeps outperforming itself 
len ratingfive Many times I ve had to access things remotely and this saved the day 
len ratingfive Good work
len ratingfour I think that google drive is a good easy way to make a document or download a picture 
len ratingfour The only problem is it is a little disorganized Compared to word 
len ratingfour Also they need to make google drive have a PowerPoint like feature 
len ratingfour Sorry google but for the most part it is a good way to do a lot of things easier and I will recommend it 
len ratingfive I was an early adopter of the G Suite apps for personal and small business usage 
len ratingfive The GDrive app gives me access to my business and personal documents wherever I am 
len ratingone I uploaded photos from my phone then deleted from phone to save storage space 
len ratingone I just noticed goodie drive doesn t retain the original photo taken or modified date 
len ratingone Only the date I uploaded to the drive 
len ratingone Is it hidden somewhere 
len ratingone Won t be uploading anything else to Google Drive 
len ratingfour  The app is really good 
len ratingfour The only problem I have with it is the fact that I can t do anything with it on my phone 
len ratingfour It may just be my type of phone but I don t think it is 
len ratingfive It holds all my stuff perfect from my school chrome book if I want to work on a online project for school on my iPad 
len ratingfive Also it has stuff that i want from my iPad so I think it s perfect
len ratingfive Love it

len ratingfour Gracias 
len ratingfour Great app just 
len ratingfour I really wanted to use google sheets google slides and google docs 
len ratingfour So I thought instead of getting four apps I could get one 
len ratingfour  Which would be drive 
len ratingfour So this app is POOP 
len ratingone To save a second video that I created on iMovie and downloaded on to Google Drive is taking me FOREVER 
len ratingone It just stops at preparing to export and when I looked up advice online it seemed like a ton of other people have the same problem 
len ratingone Wake up Google and start fixing the problem trash
len ratingone It used to be great but something happened last year my M picture upload from PC to google drive I tried to download to iPhone the picture been reduced to k how long should I wait to see the bug fixed 
len ratingfive Great Convenient way to get work done while out of the office
len ratingfive I think I have a problem that I love drive so much 
len ratingfive It helped me to keep pictures that I wanted to keep but my storage was full 
len ratingfive So I just put them in drive deleted the pictures and I still have the pictures to this day Drive helped me to make a gift for my daughters teacher 
len ratingfive  I made a beautiful scrap book 
len ratingfive I love that
len ratingfive Excellent service by Google 
len ratingfive Easily accessible 
len ratingfive Still amazing
len ratingfive I don t know
len ratingfive Best place for all things 
len ratingfive Easy to find and retrieve
len ratingone  The new version of this apps dramatically reduced the photo size when user download the photos 
len ratingone For many users photo size is a big deal 
len ratingone Such cheating for the apps performance is really unacceptable 
len ratingfive Super helpful 
len ratingfive Been using for years for business
len ratingfive I m a musician and a student 
len ratingfive Having a reliable application to save and share my work is a necessity 
len ratingfive My drive is safe and secure and allows me to access my work wherever and whenever 
len ratingfive It s available across different platforms so I never stress about not being able to access it 
len ratingfive In just a few clicks I can load any project I need and save myself the stress of not having the files I need 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this application for anyone who values safe and secure storage of files and ease of use 
len ratingtwo Glitchy Lost project
len ratingfive This helps me keep myself organized with school 
len ratingfive Such a great tool to have 
len ratingfive Love this 
len ratingtwo Have had a lot of issues with videos not loading 
len ratingtwo I use this for my video business and depend on this to send clips to them 
len ratingtwo Very Disappointed lately 
len ratingtwo It used to be dependable 
len ratingtwo Learning curve is taking longer than I like
len ratingfive I love Google Drive because of the convenience 
len ratingfive Google drive is essential for me in my day to day schedule 
len ratingfive Whether I m at the desk on the tablet or I only have my phone all my important work as well as light reading is at my finger tips 
len ratingfive It s awesome and I recommend if you love to write stories 
len ratingfive Google drive has worked well for my storage needs 
len ratingfive The files are customizable and easy to locate 
len ratingfive Very good for school 
len ratingfive Super happy 
len ratingfive It s so much easier to get to all of my stuff for all of my classes 
len ratingfive Great for students and working adults 
len ratingfive Para mi generaci n esta herramienta es asombrosa y muy til 
len ratingfive Mi reconocimiento y agradecimiento a Google por esta contribuci n para el bienestar de la Humanidad 
len ratingfive Our school is more organized and on the same page 
len ratingfive The best for saving important files
len ratingfive This app is really useful and I give it five stars
len ratingfive I like seeing all my drives on the app 
len ratingthree I really do enjoy having Drive as an option to save all my documents 
len ratingthree It s easy to use gives the ability to save a lot of files and organizes files nicely and allows for the user to choose in what way files are organized by 
len ratingthree I just wish that it opened and loaded what files are saved to it a little faster 
len ratingthree Now I am not the most patient person so maybe that s asking a bit too much given the amount I have stored to Drive but it would be nice if it was a little faster and files opened perhaps in order not all over the page randomly like they appear now as I open Drive 
len ratingfive great
len ratingtwo This app is absolutely inferior to other drive services like Dropbox etc I use both simultaneously When trying to open an audio file pdf jpg etc it takes at least x longer if it even loads then the other services making it almost impossible to reference your files on the go which in my opinion is the whole purpose 
len ratingtwo If Dropbox had options for more then tb plan say I would move everything there instead of splitting it between the two 
len ratingtwo Google you re meant to be the best the filing handling is garbage fix it
len ratingone I use my google drive to backup photos 
len ratingone This app reduces the resolution of the photo you download 
len ratingtwo Horrible 
len ratingtwo Why should I rate a review I don t want to 
len ratingfour Works great an easy convenient place to store things 
len ratingfour One thing I wish it had is a native scanner in the iPhone app like it has in the Android app 
len ratingfive Easy to locate files always comes in handy 
len ratingfive Good App
len ratingfive Idk it s just rad
len ratingfour I love this app it s very useful however I very much dislike how you have to type in the exact name of a file into the search bar for it to come up 
len ratingfour It s a bit annoying and sometimes if I haven t revisited the file in a while I don t remember it s title 
len ratingfour So making it so that key words allow related files pop up would be very helpful 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingfour If only it were easier to organize documents in Google Docs and GOOGLE Sheets it would be great 
len ratingfive I love this app for school 
len ratingthree Uploads are very slow
len ratingfour I believe that in some rare install cases the app process will hang even if the app is closed causing immense battery drain 
len ratingfour Reddit community also found this issue and said to reinstall the app 
len ratingfour Otherwise a great app 
len ratingfour I wish offline saving was a little bit easier to do maybe a whole folder so that when something is added to it or gets downloaded immediately 
len ratingfive I rely on Google Drive as assurance that data and files I might require are safely kept in the cloud 
len ratingfive My Nexus tablet became non functional so I bought an iPad th generation and Google Drive is accessible 
len ratingfive Love being able to access my documents from different devices 
len ratingfive This is an excellent tool and very useful 
len ratingfive So far I m working on the kinks but it s amazing how you can print from over the air using the app I m just truly amazed right now excited by it you can tell I m a newbie when it comes too things like this thx you again it helps a lot 
len ratingfive No comment
len ratingfive Paradigm shift in storing and filing 
len ratingfive All your important papers in your pocket 
len ratingfive Bir Grewal
len ratingone dont have password protection
len ratingfour Los archivos se demoran en subir 
len ratingfive Sometime it s hard to bring a photo here than a photo there but this app lets multi devices to use the same account so you can bring anything anywhere so it makes everything easier
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingfive Great for keeping up with all your files from music to videos to documents 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Continue updating improving 
len ratingfive I m an old guy that grew up with Word Perfect then the various versions of Micro Soft Word 
len ratingfive Now that I m old and retired and MicroSoft wants monthly or yearly payments I have switched to Google Drive Docs and Sheets 
len ratingfive They work very well and especially for someone like me they solve all of my word processing issues if word processing is still a relevant term 
len ratingfive Plus Google works seamlessly with my iPad 
len ratingfive Win win 
len ratingone I can t delete photos from this app that I delete over a year ago 
len ratingone Haven t a clue how to use it don t know where I can get tutorials In general google is hard to like and use 
len ratingone We are not all nerds out here
len ratingfive It s convenient easy to use and accessible when needed 
len ratingfive I m very happy with Drive 
len ratingfive Google drive app is pretty easy to use 
len ratingfive They let you create folders and organize your files with no problem 
len ratingfive Some of the features like managing photos is a little tricky but you can get the hang of it without too much work 
len ratingfive Would recommend 
len ratingfive Useful app
len ratingfive My only complaint is that I can t figure out how to measure the cells operator issues probably not the program 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingthree It s a great free online cloud storage service but the app crashes and in app video player could use improvement 
len ratingthree The main improvement in the video player I would like to see a button to skip or playback a few seconds 
len ratingfive Google Drive is an absolute blessing 
len ratingfive I use it for school I use it for work I handle a ton of certificates contracts material orders payments progress pictures etc 
len ratingfive  and I m sure you could use it for almost anything that requires organization 
len ratingfive It makes my job wayyy easier and finding school notes worksheets etc is easier than ever with Drive 
len ratingfive It also saves me a ton of space on my phone so that s also a plus I primarily use it on my mobile device since it s always with me 
len ratingfive I super recommend Google Drive 
len ratingfive At least try it out if you re not sure 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive So nice to have everything on all devices not take up space 
len ratingfive So cool 
len ratingfive Gianny
len ratingthree Will upgrade review to stars if music can be played in a playlist format 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingthree Maybe it s me but as a small business owner to me it seems like You should be able to click each picture and save it to a created file and it should be pretty simple but now I have to go back and dig through the pictures and figure out how to file them 
len ratingthree Another time waster
len ratingfive I downloaded this app as a way of going from my iPad to my Windows since the iPad lacks USB ports 
len ratingfive I use this app almost on a daily basis to backup iOS files to an external drive hooked up to my computer 
len ratingfive My own cloud transfer system you might say 
len ratingfive I have been very happy with the syncretism of Google drive for iOS and Windows 
len ratingfive It fits my needs perfectly since I am able to store pages documents pictures and even short movies in the drive app and pick it up on another computer by just signing into my google account 
len ratingfive I love the organization that folders in the app allows me on my iPad and Windows 
len ratingfive I would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to have a safe convenient way of storing files in the cloud and transferring them to other devices 
len ratingone I created a resume on my drive 
len ratingone I was trying to upload my resume to my application which had the option to upload from a google drive 
len ratingone Every time I do I get this sign in with Google temporarily disabled for this app 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX 
len ratingfive  Cool bruh FRE SH VOCA DO

len ratingfive It is one of the valuable tools that have allowed me to organize my life digitally 
len ratingfive A great cloud application 
len ratingfive Easy to use synced up with my computer with no problem 
len ratingfive I d say I d store here again
len ratingfour I don t want my information to be shared when I open Drive
len ratingtwo Theres not many twos on here so this was in hopes they would find that this one stands out and can look into it 
len ratingtwo so let me clarify 
len ratingtwo This app is actually GREAT 
len ratingtwo it works just like it should I want to give it a because it is very convinet for school and file uploading 
len ratingtwo Dont get me wrong I use this everyday but something I found that it lacks that could really be a benfit for the productivity of the app and to prevent you guys from being replaced by rd party apps but theres no ability to save multiple photography jpeg files at the same time through the app 
len ratingtwo There become moments where i find myself attempting to download multiple photos in the drive but I have to do them one by one which can be very tedious for graphic artist 
len ratingtwo Just a very encouraging comment 
len ratingfive Ur in the titty community
len ratingone  I m bored so I rated it star
len ratingfive great
len ratingone Very bad 
len ratingone No good 
len ratingone Would not smash 
len ratingone Hurt my feeling 
len ratingone Ugly 
len ratingfour Google drive is incredibly handy as it s linked to my google account letting me seamlessly store and retrieve files as and when I need them on top of sharing them securely without worrying about phishing 
len ratingfive I absolutely love google drive 
len ratingfive I am a huge Pinterest user and I am able to save so much information to print later

len ratingfive I have shown my year old mother how easy and convenient Drive is 
len ratingfive Thank you for a wonderful product 
len ratingfive Best applications from google 
len ratingfive I just love it 
len ratingone Difficult to find files
len ratingone My kids that are young adults don t even now how this works in your iPhone to get your pictures to your google app 
len ratingone You guys are missing out on the iPhone nation

len ratingone Directions say nothing of the drive and they are absolutely Awful 
len ratingone I still need help transferring my pictures because something is a miss 
len ratingone A Big miss 
len ratingone That says it all 
len ratingone For I ll tell you more 
len ratingone Now stop asking me
len ratingtwo Google Drive is frustrating when you are used to features you have on the Desktop being left out of the iOS version 
len ratingtwo There s currently no way to share a file in a Team Drive with someone outside of your organization 
len ratingtwo  You can do this just fine when you are on a Desktop computer 
len ratingtwo Also if you try to attach a file in the Gmail app you can t access your Team Drives at all 
len ratingfive Fabulous quality Easy to use and access Love it 
len ratingfive Get it 
len ratingfive Security 
len ratingfour  Gmail
len ratingone Can only select one photo per time 
len ratingone After hand selecting slightly swiped right and screen changed to previous 
len ratingone Calmly deselected pics then hit upload 
len ratingone Nothing happened screen timed out and closed the app 
len ratingone Now I am with data cable and not using this trash app
len ratingfive Love it nice
len ratingone I haven t been on this drive in a while but now I need to share some documents with a friend and it s like all the links are broken and the files aren t accessible 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone Thus
len ratingfour  My school has been using this for
len ratingfive This app makes it really easy for me to manage and create documents 
len ratingfive I save a lot of time by having all of my important documents for business in one place and I never have to hunt for anything 
len ratingfive The app does nearly everything Google Drive does on a computer so I never feel like I m missing out on anything 
len ratingfive I really like that this app allows for some level of interoperability with iCloud which I use to save files from the Microsoft Word app 
len ratingfive Once I finish with a document in the Word app and save it to iCloud I just share the document to Google Drive 
len ratingfive If I have any complaints it s that there s no option to save to Google Drive from the Microsoft Word app 
len ratingfive Other peripheral functions like search and quick access are also useful and help save time 
len ratingfive File management works well with the right folder structure and there s a good level of detail included in the document information summary 
len ratingfive Overall a good app 
len ratingfive Get your files from anywhere 
len ratingfive Easily interchangeable
len ratingfive The only confusing I can figure out is the side of the picture on tv with my tablet 
len ratingfive I don t know how to fix that other this app its good
len ratingone I tried to edit and nothing worked 
len ratingone THIS IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE 
len ratingone CANT OPEN OR EDIT ANYTHING 
len ratingone THIS IS A PIECE OF TRASH AND ONLY WORKS ON COMPUTER 
len ratingone THIS MADE ME STRESSED AND FAILED MY ASSIGNMENT IN SCHOOL 
len ratingthree Would rate it starts but I m currently made because it s saying I need permission to open something I created 
len ratingfive Omg I thank the Makers and the Heavens 
len ratingfour  This is a great solid simplistic app that lets you store content in it 
len ratingfour However I would like for the developers to add a casting option for if I want to watch a video or movie that has the option to change audio tracks and play subtitles that I have stored in my drive 
len ratingfive It s ye boiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioioiooioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioioiioioioioi ioioioioioioioioioioioioi
len ratingfive It works very efficiently 
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingfive What would I do without Drive 
len ratingthree I need the drive to be an option under activities when downloading something from the internet an article photo etc I need to be able to copy it and store it in drove as an option 
len ratingfour How come you can t edit google drawings on Phone 
len ratingfour please make a feature to edit google drawings NOW or else 
len ratingfive No se que har a sin Drive 
len ratingfive Discovering drive has been a game changer for me 
len ratingfive As a community activist working with multiple environmental groups in Boston s environmental justice communities I don t have a budget for IT 
len ratingfive Google Drive provides me with everything I need to conduct participatory action research via Google Forms analyze data in Google Sheets create documents and presentations with Google Docs and share via Gmail 
len ratingfive As for the learning curve 
len ratingfive Not bad at all 
len ratingfive I have learned not to be intimidated by trying new components of this powerful tool 
len ratingfive The simplicity of it as compared to Microsoft word and the office suite is surprising and takes a little getting used to LOL 
len ratingfive Drive has truly been a blessing 
len ratingfive On top of this all it is one of the most intuitive and easy to use office suites going 
len ratingfive Kitty
len ratingone Why does the info bar come and go as it pleases 
len ratingone Isn t it supposed to roll off the screen when I scroll 
len ratingone The features are neat but only if they work right 
len ratingone It just feels like google bites off more than they can chew and plays catch up with the systems I use to work 
len ratingthree A bit slow and doesn t update all the time but still gives me my documents and I can live with it
len ratingone Doesn t work
len ratingfive literally could not get through school without it 
len ratingfive thanks Google Drive
len ratingthree Google Drive is a great tool that is free for storing online data 
len ratingthree I use it for work and my school work 
len ratingthree I noticed that the Mobile version can be weird at times but I have finally found a big problem 
len ratingthree As of late I have not been able to view gif files on the mobile app 
len ratingthree I can click it but all I get is a picture not an animation 
len ratingthree This caused issues for me thanks to this error 
len ratingthree It was there before why not now 
len ratingthree The app is okay but I wish it was more like the browser version 
len ratingthree There should be an option to select multiple files and share them 
len ratingthree Instead you have to share them one at a time 
len ratingthree It s a good app but adding this feature would make it a perfect 
len ratingfive Actively use on Laptop vs Phone 
len ratingfive Having the app is that much more helpful 
len ratingfive Like This app
len ratingone Anytime I download images or videos from drive to camera roll it DELETES the file meta data for example date taken location information etc 
len ratingone This is completely unacceptable 
len ratingthree I am a YouTuber I made a video the app keeps on saying The file can t download Why can t I download my video 
len ratingthree This is super annoying 
len ratingthree Fix this bug please
len ratingone Takes forever for one image to load
len ratingfour Please add the following ability to set a link to anyone with the link for iPhone for a domain account ability to send a link from a Team Drive for iPhone ability to check sizes of folders for both desktop and mobile 
len ratingfour I manage a few projects in my account and is nice to know how large each project becomes versus having only the total storage used
len ratingone Perhaps due to zeal concerning clean interface I cannot find the requisite information to print my document 
len ratingone Once I tell it to print using my computer nothing happens 
len ratingone The same is true for attempted to download as a PDF 
len ratingone When using the phone version I do not have control over whether or not the file will print it to the width of the page so the only thing I can print out is too small to read 
len ratingfour  This is a good app you can only edit your documents though not your presentations which kind of annoys me 
len ratingfour I wish I could edit presentations but overall a good app 
len ratingfive I love how easy it is to set up folders and how quick it works 
len ratingfive Drive is awesome 
len ratingfive I absolutely love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I use the corresponding apps as well Docs Sheets and Slides 
len ratingfive However there is one issue that has been bugging me 
len ratingfive Google Forms Google Drawings don t have apps 
len ratingfive I consider these two products to be part of the Google Drive family so I believe they should get apps as well 
len ratingfive Please take this into consideration 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingthree So slow to load
len ratingfive I ve been using Drive since I opened my account it s the best all my documents are in one place and easy to access 
len ratingfive I would recommend it to everyone especially when you traveling and you only have your mobile phone no need for a laptop 
len ratingthree Too many hoops to jump thru THE GOOGLE way to get an end result 
len ratingthree Make Keep it SIMPLE Stupid 
len ratingfive So helpful better than other cloud applications in my opinion 
len ratingfive Google Drive makes life so much easier 
len ratingfive As a photographer l can create and add images to my body of work saving them through drive 
len ratingfive  The app doesn t act up much anymore it still freezes every now in then
len ratingfive Very nice
len ratingfive Yep
len ratingone Can t open some powerpoints from google classroom 
len ratingfour I have to screenshot my graphic design works on Drive that I access by phone to show people and it just looks unprofessional 
len ratingthree Why is there no side scroller for any of the documents 
len ratingthree The android version of this app has one not the iOS version 
len ratingthree I use this app mainly for PDF textbooks am I supposed to scroll to page by swiping my fingers times 
len ratingfive This is a good app because you don t have to save it 
len ratingfive It will save by itself 
len ratingfive And this is a good app for everyone 
len ratingfive Put loads of papers and documents on one app 
len ratingfive I use this app to store my guitar chord sheets but you can use it in many ways 
len ratingfive You get tons of space in the cloud for free and if you need more buy it at a low price 
len ratingfive Enjoy 
len ratingtwo I love this app but I have an iphones and it will not let me save a video to my gallery it does not even give me the option 
len ratingtwo So I have to screenrecord
len ratingfive Great tool in organizing your work and your life 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I love the Drive 
len ratingfive I am able to share documents from my computer to my IPad
len ratingtwo I ve tried on multiple devices but no matter what the files that were downloaded after the update occurred won t download to any software or device and as I ve said I ve tried on many devices 
len ratingtwo Please fix this bug Thank you 
len ratingfive Great for school
len ratingfive Thank you this app helps with my school work 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive This app is so dope love it no doubt 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Very useful
len ratingone I haven t found google drive to be very useful at all 
len ratingone Yes recent documents show up in recents but none of the files associated with those documents are available 
len ratingone Therefore you have to know the exact name of the document you re looking for cause you won t be able to find it under a file name 
len ratingfive I love drive because it has great privacy and sharing contact
len ratingfive Drive is easy to use I can organize my folders the way that I need them 
len ratingfive  reliable easy to use accessible anywhere worldwide I m a big fan 
len ratingfive This app has never let me down even once 
len ratingtwo  I tried to click the support link to ask this but it looks like that site doesn t actually exist anymore 
len ratingtwo I use this to upload videos since phone can t store them 
len ratingtwo It s way better than iCloud for WATCHING vids but for uploading it doesn t work 
len ratingtwo i see the upload bar put down my phone and go do something else while uploading and then when I get back and unlock the phone its back to my photo screen and nothing has been uploaded 
len ratingtwo I mean is it that hard to program in a prompt that reports whether the video was uploaded is processing or didn t upload 
len ratingtwo Do I need to make sure the phone doesn t fall asleep 
len ratingtwo Can it not upload as a background task 
len ratingtwo GIMME A SIGN 
len ratingfive I m so impressed how well everything works making business easier 
len ratingfive I do a lot of work from home and having Google Drive is like carrying my desktop absolutely everywhere I go it s SO easy so convenient so much better than emailing docs I need from the office home or vice versa saving docs to a flash and trying to keep track of that if you aren t using drive start 
len ratingfive It is undeniably the most handy tool I use 
len ratingtwo I keep expecting Google to update Drive for iOS to actually work with the native Files where instead it constantly hits memory problems and to borrow native iOS conventions 
len ratingtwo Since my organization uses G Suite I am stuck with it but I dread as an iOS only professional every time I have to use Drive 
len ratingtwo It almost seems like Google is deliberately hobbling a rival s device capability and I have the same thoughts about Sheets and Docs which have a limited feature set very weird cursor conventions and predictable lags in adopting new iOS features 
len ratingfive  Data backup
len ratingfive Good
len ratingthree Can t annotate PDFs 
len ratingthree This seems to be a common feature in most other similar applications
len ratingfive Truly great application 
len ratingfive Helped me a lot 
len ratingthree I need passcode option back 
len ratingfive Very easy convenient and fast management of my google drive
len ratingfive Thank you for taking race day pictures 
len ratingfive They are awesome 
len ratingfive It s awesome
len ratingfive Lit
len ratingone This should be a basic function 
len ratingone It s clear google made this extremely hard to do on purpose since nearly every other cloud product makes it very easy and intuitive to figure out 
len ratingone Outside concept 
len ratingone Soon will be replaced in market 
len ratingfive Helps me with school so I love it specially if I m sick and I can t go to school I can start my assignment that s in google classroom and in google drive 
len ratingfive Very easy to use P
len ratingfour For the security it should be protected by password every time 
len ratingfive I don t need to carry my laptop or ipad 
len ratingfive I can carry receive and share every file by my phone 
len ratingfive My favorite cloud storage 
len ratingfive More convenient than all the other similar competitors 
len ratingfive Always compatible with every device I own or I happen to be using 
len ratingthree I wish it was easier to organize and navigate shared drives and folders 
len ratingthree Sometimes people save things for me and I can t find them 
len ratingfive Google docs is amazing it helps me organize all of my work 
len ratingfive No matter what it is or what it is for they have folders docs slideshows spreadsheets and a lot more 
len ratingfour You need to make the grammar review to be better
len ratingfive I love that I can write a paper or other document and it is there waiting for me on any of my devices
len ratingthree Great app I m a paid subscriber of Google drive or Google One However it does lack a very important feature which is user login security 
len ratingthree On iPhones you should be adding support for FaceID and TouchID since at this time anyone can open the app as long as the phone is unlocked and that shouldn t be a precondition 
len ratingthree Rest all is fine with the app 
len ratingfive The drive allows my club to exchange and store files that we use all the time 
len ratingfive Thanks for providing it 
len ratingthree To many apps for it
len ratingfive Hi I m shadow I like this app because it s good for school and I can HACK and other things this is the best app
len ratingfive The thing I like about this drive is that it coordinates all your Google Docs and Google Sheets in one place 
len ratingfive It is the greatest app ever I can do homework on it
len ratingfive I love all Google products 
len ratingfive It works fine but is often sluggish 
len ratingfive Okay not sluggish but clunky 
len ratingfive I wish there was a lite version for these googliyyyyy apps 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a great app 
len ratingfive It has improved over the years and keeps getting better 
len ratingone Blame it on Apple of course 
len ratingone They re so isolated and isolating 
len ratingone I only switched from Android to iPhone because the other options offered by Sprint weren t good enough for my standards 
len ratingone Yet one day I ll go back to Android 
len ratingone Hopefully Google will make HTC great 
len ratingfive Google drive is easy to use and very helpful 
len ratingfive El almacenamiento de Google es f cil de usar y ayuda mucho 
len ratingone Just let me use google drive on my web browser 
len ratingone Don t make me download an app that barely works and is hard to use 
len ratingfive Using it for long time without problem
len ratingfour It s not clear how to transfer documents between various devices 
len ratingfour I do not have a computer and it s very difficult
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive  I m still admiring the app 
len ratingfive Anne Mautner
len ratingone It doesn t work on a cellular connection 
len ratingone At all 
len ratingone This app stinks
len ratingtwo Useless without ability to password protect the access to app password touch id or face id 
len ratingone I hate this stupid app 
len ratingfive Perfecto me saca de muchos apuros en el iPhone
len ratingone  minute onscreen 
len ratingone  min background 
len ratingone  battery gone 
len ratingone Background app refresh turned off for entire phone too 
len ratingone Google 
len ratingone You re way better than this 
len ratingfive Makes things so easy when on the fly 
len ratingfive Wonderful job Google for allowing us to have a virtual Filing Cabinet from our phone to our computers 
len ratingfive Then to have multiple users editing Docs Slides Sheets is simply amazing 
len ratingone Videos take long time to process
len ratingfive I use Google Drive in every phase of my life personal work school and hobbies 
len ratingfive I m a data information document hoarder 
len ratingfive I love to organize and sort all of my documents into google drive 
len ratingfive Only thing that could make it better would be for the video player to be better on the app 
len ratingfive If it was like YouTubes player how it is on the drive on a desktop it would be so much better 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfour I just want to add the comment not click on the photos to add them or at least make it easier to do so
len ratingone  no option to save media directly to phone or tablet once you click to watch a video no way to close it out 
len ratingone The x button doesn t work 
len ratingone I have to close the app every single time 
len ratingone MAJOR FLAW 
len ratingone If the data is in the cloud why is so much data being used on my devices 
len ratingone There shouldn t be any Documents Data on the device but there is a substantial amount 
len ratingone The app deserves star until this is fixed 
len ratingone Still no fix 
len ratingthree The google drive is great unless I am working on my phone 
len ratingthree Unable to edit documents but can access and read them from iPhone 
len ratingfive Google Drive
len ratingfive Never been a fan of cloud based software 
len ratingfive To old school 
len ratingfive But your sorta forced into the cloud 
len ratingfive Everything is cloud 
len ratingfive Anyway I really like Google Drive because it is easy 
len ratingfive AND it synchronizes with my laptop 
len ratingfive So I know whatever is in the cloud is also on my laptop HDD which I can copy to an external HDD if I so choose 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive I use this app on my iPhone 
len ratingfive I like it because you can when and how to use 
len ratingfive iPhone decides on it s own what to save or delete 
len ratingtwo Seems like every time I go to login there s a issue with my password 
len ratingtwo I m about at the end of my rope with this Google app 
len ratingfive Great cloud backup
len ratingfive I use this app everyday 
len ratingfive Quick search for needed stored documents 
len ratingfour I love this app 
len ratingfour So useful and ease of use is amazing 
len ratingfour It s the most convenient way to store and upload your pictures or videos 
len ratingfour Edit I wish they allowed for a drive account storage transfer 
len ratingfour I just created a new gmail and need to merge the data into one secure account 
len ratingfour This way I can delete an old email address
len ratingfive I used Dropbox before but now have a very simple system with Google 
len ratingfive It has full integration with all google products 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingthree This is a great product but one huge and basic thing is missing you cannot protect your files with FaceID or TouchID or even a single password 
len ratingthree What this means is that if you lend your cellphone to someone to make a call or whatever that person can simply open Google Drive and look at all your files 
len ratingthree Not good at all 
len ratingthree The funny thing is that at one point before they use to allow us to protect with a password but then removed it without any real explanation for doing so 
len ratingfive Works well across devices pc phone tablet and platforms windows iOS Android 
len ratingtwo It s impossible to download photos from your drive to your phone 
len ratingtwo I ve tried for months and it doesn t work which is super frustrating 
len ratingtwo I thought the problem would be fixed after all the error warnings 
len ratingtwo I enjoy the rest of google drive so this review is referencing my experience of the phone application 
len ratingfour It is so cool and easy to use this app I love it very much 
len ratingfour Super great 
len ratingfive Great application 
len ratingfive I have been using it for years and now cannot live without it 
len ratingfive Great app I can use it anywhere on my iPhone pad and MacBook 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfour Yay
len ratingone Too slow and not responsive
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive This stuf great man
len ratingthree PDFs apparently don t use native rendering and instead are rendered by the google drive app 
len ratingthree The same pdf looks fine in safari or mail app but is blank in google drive 
len ratingthree I have a feeling few people are still there in my head class but the other day one girls
len ratingfive Glad that I discovered this app because I m able to review documents and personal budget anytime and anywhere 
len ratingone I m not sure if it is google s incompetence or design choice but how can you not allow users to download multiple files 
len ratingone Every time I open a file of mine on my phone the left of the screen turns completely white and I can t see my full document
len ratingfour Read the stars I said what I said
len ratingfive Great to have every document on your finger tips 
len ratingfive It saved me from many problems during my bussiness deal because I had all my documents right in my pocket when I needed 
len ratingfive But I do not like when they limit me 
len ratingfive Everything is at my fingertips now
len ratingfive With the amount of paper saved for using google is great 
len ratingfive Plus very user friendly
len ratingone Playing videos shared with me is extremely slow 
len ratingone It s been this way for a year 
len ratingone I have unlimited data and a new iPhone yet my videos barely play unless I m at home on WiFi
len ratingfive The best hands down 
len ratingfive I use google docs sheets everyday and having all my files on my phone is incredibly useful 
len ratingfive I use the drive app as a kind of bridge between my laptop and phone 
len ratingfive Especially fond of the offline editing function 
len ratingfive I wish there was a way for all the google drive functions docs sheets slides to be in one app but otherwise I have no complaints 
len ratingone See title 
len ratingone Super cool love this app
len ratingfive Google Drive is reliable when important ongoing projects are on the line 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Keeps all my stuff safe no matter what i lose my phone or it gets stolen u can pull up my info everytime safe pictures in all love it 
len ratingone I have downloaded the app 
len ratingone But still can t edit any document that I have 
len ratingone It is so irritating when I am on the go and not at my computer that I can t edit any documents
len ratingfive This app is fantastic I can easily send my resume out amongst other important files 
len ratingfive I can access all my docs everywhere and anywhere 
len ratingfive It s a super convenient app 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive I work on three different computers at three different locations 
len ratingfive I have been using OneDrive for the last three years 
len ratingfive I find it very easy to use very fast and easily accessible 
len ratingfive I love the apps and the flexibility it offers in handling files 
len ratingfive Works great love it 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a nice service from Search engine Google
len ratingone  Even after photos upload it still acts like more are uploading 
len ratingone Use every day and says uploading of even though nothing is uploading 
len ratingone Then while it s uploading it crashes and then all pending uploads fail and retry to just keep failing so have to delete all photos and start over 
len ratingfive  Google Drive helps me be organized and it has an easy way to find what you need 
len ratingfive When you wanna be sure if you saved it just look it up in the search bar type the title and BOOM 
len ratingfive This app is so amazing and helps you see stuff on your laptop that you saved when going out 
len ratingfive If I could describe this app in one word it would be AMAZING 
len ratingone The zoom view goes back to the default view when you touch a PDF 
len ratingone This is really annoying 
len ratingone Please fix the bug 
len ratingfive For a person who is not a technical this is easy to use 
len ratingfive I have saved and shared files 
len ratingone That s what this is
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive Sredine
len ratingfour The only thing is you can t do certain things like finding your classes if you go to schools
len ratingthree I generally love Google drive but the iOS app used to be sooo much more user friendly when it came to moving items between folders 
len ratingthree You used to be able to press on an item s icon it would drop to the bottom of the screen and then you could drag it right into to the folder you wanted 
len ratingthree Now every time you want to move any item you have to select Move and then begin at the very beginning of your drive and click through every single folder until you find the one you want 
len ratingthree Am extremely tedious step backward in design Please consider switching back to the more mobile friendly style of moving items that you used to have 
len ratingthree Please also add the ability to ADD TO a folder instead of totally moving an item into a folder On computers we can click Control and then the green Add button to add an item to a new folder while also keeping it in the original folder 
len ratingone I have a video from a performance that is only accessible using Google Drive and I d like to be able to watch it on my TV using Apple TV but it won t let me 
len ratingone Unable to send it to a printer m
len ratingfour I have a Chromebook computer and this app makes it so much easier and nearly hassle free to transfer files amp photographs from my phone to my laptop 
len ratingfour This is a phenomenal place to keep my journal away from prying see nosey eyes as well 
len ratingfour I would just suggest that they allow a user to password protect certain sensitive private or personal files 
len ratingfour I also wish you could name and color code photos as you download them so you can do everything at once 
len ratingfour  Thanks Google 
len ratingfive  Google drive lets me contact my fellow classmates and my teachers for what the homework is and for actual homework 
len ratingfive I really recommend this app to anyone who is used to using google apps and has a lot of work they need to finish 
len ratingone It constantly gets in your way 
len ratingone Pop ups appear so you erroneously tap them 
len ratingone You can t download to Dropbox or OneDrive 
len ratingone If you change the type in a file name it looks inside the file and changes it back if you email it 
len ratingone The Dropbox app is much easier to use 
len ratingthree It s very good but it would the best if it will have an option to lock the app using password 
len ratingthree Currently anybody who has access to your phone can have access to you contents 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive for years and love it 
len ratingthree  I m having trouble using the main function of the app when i try to save a file from various locations including Share and through gmail save to drive i get that notification Unable to complete the action 
len ratingthree Please try again it s a big inconvenience
len ratingfive Possibly the best storage and seamless file uploads 
len ratingfive What a great program 
len ratingone Awful video loading times connected to gigabit WiFi and still takes a long time 
len ratingone Then it also has button issues 
len ratingone It wouldn t let me open my file 
len ratingone It just kept black and didn t show it 
len ratingfive  You can keep all of your papers organized and your slideshows and docs 
len ratingfive Professional and efficient app 
len ratingfive As a musician this is the absolute best way to preserve my music files 
len ratingfive I play in several groups and having access to my music at all times is very important 
len ratingfive It allows me to air drop parts directly to my iPad so I don t have extra books of music to bring to gigs 
len ratingfive Using Google Drive allows me to have pristine written parts at all times 
len ratingfive I am enjoying the different search engines 
len ratingfive I am trialing all the next year 
len ratingfive Then I will choose 
len ratingfive  As a special needs mom I need a place to keep what seems like the ENDLESS paperwork for my little 
len ratingfive It s so easy to scan and organize my little s medical documents his evaluations things for his school and then keep them in my drive 
len ratingfive I can label them all so if I ever need to find that one document from months ago I can type in some keywords that I put in the description and boom that lost paper is now found 
len ratingfive It seriously is a godsend for me and I don t know what I would do without this FREE service 
len ratingfive Killin it Google 
len ratingfive Love it Porchlight
len ratingfour Reeeeerrr
len ratingfive It s a great App but we need more space for uploading
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingone Good app but not worth stars yet they need to make this more usher friendlier and less frictional 
len ratingfive I appreciate this app 
len ratingfive I don t have to email myself anything 
len ratingfour I rated four stars because it was overall good butt I wish you could add friends
len ratingone I have a pages pdf document 
len ratingone I can use the same google drive app to find page quickly on a android phone since there is a quick drag down on the right 
len ratingone However the drive on apple store does not have the ability to quickly find that page 
len ratingone You can only drag down a few pages each time 
len ratingone What makes it worse is that you accidentally open another document if you touch the side 
len ratingone On android when you touch the side you get the quick drag down and stay in the same document 
len ratingone I hope the developer can see my comment and address it 
len ratingone I will be happy to change it to five stars when the issues are addressed 
len ratingfive Learning curve not too steep or complicated reliable as available as the Internet connection price just right 
len ratingfour Good app
len ratingfive The music you send through google drive will pick up on any device even iPhone 
len ratingtwo Don t like the app because you Don t write
len ratingfive Tuy t v i
len ratingfive Drive is really useful for school work or home you can tap to share and the recipient doesn t even need to have the Drive app 
len ratingfive You can just send it by text 
len ratingtwo I want to rename a file 
len ratingtwo I guess I need a Manual to figure out how 
len ratingthree It s limited 
len ratingfive I have been using this google drive app and it really help full for all my day to day documents storage and very very happy about this App
len ratingfive Es una manera muy f cil de organizar las fotos en diferentes carpetas y de una forma segura 
len ratingfive Puedes compartir si quieres a las personas que quieras el contenido
len ratingone Can t find google drive on my iphone
len ratingfive Excelente herramienta para guardar grandes o peque os archivos facil acceso desde whatsapp y no usar tanta memoria del telefono en archivos y ayuda a compartir archivos compartiendo el link sin tener que cargar nuevamente el archivo en el telefono
len ratingone When I first downloaded this app it worked great but now for some reason all I get is white pages on all shared documents 
len ratingfive  This app is so good for stores so you keep all your work in time
len ratingone No password protection in Google Drive 
len ratingone What kind of boiler room operation is this 
len ratingone ONE STAR 
len ratingfive Love this except incessant request for reviews
len ratingone I have utilized the google drive on a number of occasions and have found it to be rudimentary and all but useless for managing my workflow 
len ratingfive This app has been extremely helpful to me to save and take my documents online and use them immediately when I needed them 
len ratingfive Thanks for this 
len ratingfive Bhadra P
len ratingfive This makes my life easier for taking print jobs to Staples
len ratingfour Hard to tap to pause tap to play and exiting a video 
len ratingfour There s two x s that could pop up one is the big one which does nothing and the small one is the one that actually exits out 
len ratingfour In conclusion although it is operational it is confusing compared to the way youtube had their pause play and exit feature 
len ratingfive Fan fu ing tastic
len ratingfive Thanks a lot
len ratingone Not all that user friendly 
len ratingone  Update January This still isn t fixed 
len ratingone I love this app but why did you take away the privacy Google 
len ratingone Look at the Microsoft Outlook app for example they allow you to lock it to secure your emails but Google won t allow this feature for my photos documents 
len ratingone Before I had my Apple iPhone X whenever I went to the app it would prompt me to enter my passcode or use TouchID 
len ratingone Now that I have the iPhone X it states that my iPhone security is now the only option I have and that s the problem 
len ratingone If I hand someone my phone they can go into Google Drive 
len ratingone I liked having Google Drive still locked even when my phone was unlocked 
len ratingone Google you need to allow users to still be able to keep Google Drive locked even if their phone is unlocked 
len ratingone Just enable FaceID to come up everytime the app is opened as an option 
len ratingone Please don t take away options 
len ratingone Google Drive is an outdated app that upscales low resolution content for new iPhones 
len ratingone The app is blurry and unusable 
len ratingthree Video exporting never works for me 
len ratingthree Just continuous loop of exporting until it fails 
len ratingthree  The app doesn t act up much anymore it still freezes every now in then
len ratingfive I
len ratingfive Microsoft one drive unnessasary 
len ratingfive Overall google drive is a good app to save things and keep working on it 
len ratingfive But on the iPhone google drive it doesn t have gmail so I can t my email on google drive which is very annoying 
len ratingfive So I request you to allow the google drive on iPhone to access to google email 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone  star for that 
len ratingone Unzip files already 
len ratingfive So glad this came in an app 
len ratingfive I ve had to use it several times when I don t have my computer with me 
len ratingfive No bugs easy to move stuff around
len ratingfive I love this I been using this for years I love it
len ratingone It s by far the worst app I ve used 
len ratingone I use it on iPhone and iPad and it crashes of the time 
len ratingone Please fix it or do us a favor and got rid of the drive app 
len ratingfive Nothing much to say here another piece of GREATNESS from Google 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone I ve been trying to upload a video for hours
len ratingfour Works pretty well but file drag and drop seems a bit spotty at least on MacOS High Sierra 
len ratingfive Fun and easy to use
len ratingfive This is a best app to organize docs attachments PDFs more
len ratingfive Awesome way to organize data 
len ratingfive I like the ease of creating folders and sub folders 
len ratingone Just stupid can t open a simple file 
len ratingfive The Drive is soooo very helpful when it comes to my work load 
len ratingfive I love apps that make things easier 
len ratingfive This is definitely one of those apps 
len ratingfive From documents to spreadsheets it is a one stop shop 
len ratingthree It would be great if I didn t have to download other apps like docs or sheets to edit 
len ratingthree Editing everything in one place like drive on desktop would be much easier 
len ratingthree Other than that it is a great design and layout just not very useful 
len ratingfour Drive is a wonderful port of the google drive experience 
len ratingfour The frustrating part for me is being unable to access speaker notes if I don t have the slides app even though I can look at the slides and unable to edit documents unless I have the writing app etc 
len ratingfive The press to hold and save images had been broken but is now fixed 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone Like if I want to send a photo that the recipient can look at but not share with anyone else how do I do that 
len ratingone Give the password protection pleasssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeee Why you guys remove it it s so painful to not have the password protection 
len ratingfour The link to the cloud is strong and gives reliable results 
len ratingfour It s recommended
len ratingone normally every tuesday and thursday i hold a beyblade club at my school 
len ratingone i keep a schedule for tournaments on my google drive and when i downloaded it it wouldn t even let me share the freaking spreadsheet 
len ratingone what the freak 
len ratingone  my mom said i cant use the f word now my beyblade club is ruined forever thanks to fricking google 
len ratingone i just wanted to let it rip but now i m stuck with just playing pok mon cards instead of beyblades 
len ratingone NOT COOL 
len ratingtwo Why do I have to download another app to edit my docs 
len ratingtwo It s nice I can view it on the go but that s about it 
len ratingfive Juicy booty you got there google drive 
len ratingfive I want to be friends with it 
len ratingfive Great tool to access your files 
len ratingfive Bring up all your files on your mobile with the same features and functionality as your computer 
len ratingfive No learning curve if you are already familiar with Google Drive 
len ratingfive Would expect nothing less 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Substantial space ready accessibility from anywhere converts web pages to pdfs 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive A number of refinements since the above 
len ratingfive One feature that would be useful is to directly download from a URL to the drive 
len ratingfive I like my drive 
len ratingfive You can store as much as you can in my drive and anything you want to put in there 
len ratingfive I m very grateful for this app 
len ratingtwo I can t seem to download any pics that I used to have been able to 
len ratingtwo I don t understand what I m doing wrong 
len ratingtwo Kind of frustrating 
len ratingfive Google Drive has grown to be a very solid and efficient system to work on data and then share with our teams 
len ratingfive Collaboration is a key to our success with people located throughout the US 
len ratingfive There are protocols that all parties need to follow and if they do that the process works great 
len ratingfive If problems occur we find that most are human errors of protocol violations that actually are easy to fix 
len ratingfive Love using Google Drive 
len ratingfive I use it all the time wherever I go 
len ratingfive I use this app for photo and video storage and it works great I have a lot of pictures and i haven t ran out of space yet 
len ratingfive recommended 
len ratingfive This helps me sooooo much with my business google sponsor me 
len ratingfive Es una extraordinaria herramienta para soportar nuestra informaci n
len ratingfive Words Connor explain 
len ratingfive Love this application 
len ratingfour iPad version good but missing some important functions such as save as pdf file and attach

len ratingfive It does everything I need for records and photo storage 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive It s by far the most used app I have 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive With Google Drive I can access all my files on the go

len ratingfive Great way to organize your information pictures and other saved information 
len ratingfive Great access from the Internet 
len ratingfive Use this app a lot 
len ratingfive  Good to have all your memories here nice and safe
len ratingtwo I ve been trying to use GDrive as my server for my small business for the past two years but we frequently have issues with who can can t access folders not syncing across all devices etc 
len ratingtwo Had another person on my company take over the file management and they also experienced issues 
len ratingtwo Just switched to Dropbox 
len ratingtwo Great service and products 
len ratingfive I really don t know what I would do without Google Drive 
len ratingfive As a teacher it s so nice to be able to access my files easily anywhere 
len ratingfive Google is just amazing all around who the hell needs to spend money on Microsoft office anymore 
len ratingfive Thanks Google I love you 
len ratingfive Way better than IOS
len ratingfour Having more options like when an annum or photos are saved and shared with can be saved easily in the same drive 
len ratingfive Great app for work docs in the go
len ratingfive thanks
len ratingtwo I don t understand why it shows files or activity but I can t see what s in it 
len ratingtwo Is there a way 
len ratingtwo Offline storage does not work 
len ratingtwo Trying to use to watch a video during a flight 
len ratingtwo Reloaded and updated all files still won t play 
len ratingfive A most convenient way of accessing computer files on a hand held device
len ratingfive These people have organized some part of my life 
len ratingone Forcing you to allow google access to safari and other apps simply by logging into Drive is completely unacceptable 
len ratingfive Service is Excellent
len ratingfive I like that I m able to upload my iPhone photos to this with a breeze saves the effort of uploading them to a physical hard drive 
len ratingfive This app service is amazing 
len ratingfive It works across devices it s inexpensive 
len ratingfive I use it for all my business stuff I can share with collaborators just yes 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive It flipping rules 
len ratingfive Can drop files from anywhere and pick them up anywhere 
len ratingfour Keeps zooming out when viewing PDFs 
len ratingfour Idk if it s reloading the doc or some zoom issue but it s not usable 
len ratingfour Happens on iPhone and iPad 
len ratingone Forces user to buy more data storage 
len ratingone Help is useless 
len ratingfive Good to use and store projects essays slides

len ratingfive It s awesome 
len ratingfive Maddie is anoying

len ratingtwo App isn t intuitive and user friendly

len ratingfive It s amazing
len ratingfive Find this really helpful to have on my iPhone 
len ratingfive  hi Add me on ps never disguised
len ratingone How is it possible to not be able to Download photos on phone 
len ratingfour I so LOVE this app 
len ratingfour Been using more than yrs 
len ratingfour But all the things I can do I m still unable to view my drive items on my chromecast 
len ratingfour It truly makes no sense when you consider all the non google related apps that offer the chromecast function
len ratingfive I love Google Drive
len ratingone  The Drive app itself is good 
len ratingone But in when Drive has been around for many years there s NO reason this app shouldn t offer some type of security 
len ratingone OneDrive and Dropbox both offer security options whether it s PIN password or FaceID 
len ratingone Google Drive offers absolutely ZERO security options which doesn t make any sense considering the potential sensitive information users could be saving there 
len ratingfive When I started using Google Drive I was very pleased with how I can work from practically anywhere 
len ratingfive Even if my IPad or computer is at home I can still work on my phone 
len ratingfive This is great because I have gotten so much work done just when I am waiting for my burrito at Chipotle 
len ratingfive Overall I think it is definitely worth getting an account and being able to work from any device anywhere is spectacular 
len ratingfive Need a quick backup plan This google drive is easy and simple to use 
len ratingfive It changes my daily life 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Need easier access to offline access button 
len ratingfive  Awesome

len ratingfive I have always believed in that

len ratingfive  I love drive because I use it at school and it s really great
len ratingone  Decreased quality Freezes don t try and upload more than pictures at a time only god knows why because I m afraid to ask anymore 
len ratingone Google NSA and definitely Russkiaya are doing this on purpose 
len ratingfour The app is just excellent and a pleasure to use 
len ratingfour But I can t download multiple photos saved in the drive at once which is really annoying amd limiting please add an option to do so 
len ratingfive We ve got to resolve threats to cyber security quickly 
len ratingfive Innovation is going at warped speed 
len ratingfive Wow I love making story s on slides poems on docs tests on forms from the beginning to end stuff on sheets 
len ratingfive AMAZING APP
len ratingfive I really recommend it to anyone who doesn t want to spend time on searching for a good cloud app or storage 
len ratingfive Google drive provides what you want 
len ratingfour Sharing should be more simpler
len ratingfive Awesome work 
len ratingfive They consistently do amazing things 
len ratingfive Alright
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfive A Must Have 
len ratingfive Excelente
len ratingthree Using this app is nicer than using the Drive web interface but everything is just a bit off 
len ratingthree The animations are a little funky and the controls are a little strange and the viewers don t quite work like iOS users expect 
len ratingthree For example if you re looking at a word processing file and zoom it will automatically unzoom after a second 
len ratingthree This makes it exceptionally frustrating to try to read anything and there s just no reason for it 
len ratingthree The video and photo viewers have annoying quirks too 
len ratingthree Still it s convenient to have Google Drive as an app 
len ratingthree I m glad I have it and I use it all the time 
len ratingthree I just wish they d take a bit more care getting the details right 
len ratingone It seems that all of a sudden whenever I open a word doc or excel spreadsheet from iCloud Drive it gets hijacked by google drive and asks if I want to save the file 
len ratingone If I select no the file does not open have not tried selecting yes as I do not want these files on Google drive 
len ratingone Until that is fixed I am unable to use Google Drive and am forced to delete it in order to access my iCloud Drive files 
len ratingfive It s a great app that helps me keep track of things I need to doing and it has all sorts of special features that help me with write typing 
len ratingfour We might switch to Dropbox at Google drive not cost beneficial
len ratingfive This is amazing app 
len ratingfive I like using it
len ratingone UTF 
len ratingone Can t open it all I see is a black screen with a zipper
len ratingfive Stores everything that makes it very convenient 
len ratingone Dear Google QA Try making a lot of content available offline 
len ratingone It is very unreliable 
len ratingfive With my google drive
len ratingone It doesn t syncronize that well
len ratingfour Starting to get more familiar w using this and will continue saving more things in it
len ratingfour But sharing the download link to my friends is not OK 
len ratingfour The link my friend received ask for the permission of me 
len ratingfive This is great to keep track of co parenting stuff 
len ratingfive I could not believe how easy it was to upload pictures recordings anything 
len ratingfive Just wish it had some sort of calendar feature 
len ratingfive Couldn t operate without Drive 
len ratingfour Google Drive is a good site but the reason why I gave it a four star is because the app sometimes takes sometime to load the videos from the phone to computer 
len ratingfour That is not just my phone I have a iPhone XR and I transfer it to my brand knew MacBook Pro 
len ratingone Not intuitive cumbersome hidden files and emails 
len ratingone Take a lesson from MS Outlook 
len ratingone Worst is having to try original nickname over and over b c many negative coins are used 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone Can t download my school papers from the app
len ratingthree Why was the password protection removed 
len ratingone  Documents saved on Google Drive often do not print out properly even when scanned in proper Word or PDF format 
len ratingone Not reliable 
len ratingone Two major things I can think of that would make me give Drive a good rating 
len ratingone Allow easy conversion of clumsy large image documents to PDF or Word format with smaller file size 
len ratingone Fix whatever bug is causing documents saved to Drive to not print out properly ie When I sent a doc by email to my attorney she reported that it came out too small and was barely readable 
len ratingone PDF documents saved to my iScanner app but never saved on Drive came out fine when printed 
len ratingfive F cil y vers til 
len ratingfour Drive integrates seamlessly with my school account 
len ratingfive Google really does a nice job of making a useful app for the Google Drive
len ratingfour I love the app but it s been crashing like crazy since the latest update 
len ratingfour Seems to happen to certain word files 
len ratingfive It saves data that s why I did stars
len ratingthree There is not estimated timed and it takes extremely longer than it does on pc 
len ratingthree I mainly use Google drive to store my photos for school 
len ratingthree I wish the process of saving a photo to my camera roll was easier however 
len ratingthree I would like if you would be able to press and hold in a photo and be given the option to save to the camera roll 
len ratingthree More Send a copy and then finally save to camera roll is frustrating and slow 
len ratingthree Another complaint I have is how sometimes a photo loads and then you swipe back to the photo and it has to load again 
len ratingthree I don t know if that is a memory problem but I wish it was simpler
len ratingfive itsgood
len ratingone Might as well use a toaster instead of this
len ratingone I m just a hater haven t even downloaded it yet lol
len ratingfive Very handy easy to use 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Really well done great reminder
len ratingfive Unlike Microsoft products Yesterday s technology tomorrow Drive works perfectly 
len ratingfive I ve used it consistently for years moving my national e commerce business to the Google platform from MS software 
len ratingfour This app is sometimes very slow and it s not as good as Microsoft OneDrive 
len ratingfour But it works better than Dropbox and some other cloud storage apps 
len ratingfour The best part about this service is that it s free for anyone who has a Gmail account 
len ratingfive Even though drive gives me a hard time with permissions now is till give it a five 
len ratingfive I just wish it didn t lock all my files 
len ratingfive I just want to share and be done 
len ratingfive Lately I have had to go in and manually change the sharing settings so those I shared with can download and view 
len ratingtwo i am experiencing utter slow while accessing compared to dropbox
len ratingfive I love this app It is great for gaming YouTube videos Thank you
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive Easy to share and collaborate 
len ratingfive Definitely my go to app for teamwork 
len ratingone I can t even keep it open for a second and sometimes not even that I need to get something out of it but I can t not worth it anymore to have it
len ratingthree Some docs won t work on this app and just work better on drive 
len ratingthree The problem is I do want to like it 
len ratingone  This app is dreadful and almost led to the death of all of my cats
len ratingone It s complicated
len ratingfive  Bye bye
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive We use this at our school and it s so organized I could not be any happier 
len ratingfive I m just concerned about SECURITY 
len ratingfour Would be nice if I could save videos from my drive to my camera roll
len ratingone No setting to upload audio recording from voice recorder app
len ratingone Takes a LONG TIME to start up 
len ratingone Also stop annoying me about feedback 
len ratingone Welp here s your feedback 
len ratingone You can t do anything 
len ratingthree I want to be able to upload my file to youtube and fix connection with garage band i cant get it to download from garbage band to drive i have to upload my music first to yahoo mail or something like that 
len ratingfour I would love to utilize the software application more often 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Must have on any phone 
len ratingone Documents disappear 
len ratingone Sharing them is difficult
len ratingthree Having problems with it sink into my computer 
len ratingthree We should have some type of quick note or you could store a Google Keep note in these files
len ratingone Well thanks for interrupting my work 
len ratingone Here s your feedback 
len ratingfive Best ever
len ratingfive Like I said in the title
len ratingone Unfortunate feature 
len ratingfive This is the bast a only place that i can make stuff and have it saved for when I have to use my stuff for projects and school
len ratingfive I love you google drive
len ratingfive Basically this is so seamlessly functional I don t understand what it is doing but it works 
len ratingfive His has really helped me with my school work thank you Google Drive 
len ratingthree A frustrating bug 
len ratingthree I can t read anything in mobile docs because it keeps zooming out when I don t hold the zoom with two fingers 
len ratingtwo Definitely plenty to learn from Dropbox on how to do mobile
len ratingone  Files saved on Google Drive often do not print out properly even when scanned in proper Word or PDF format 
len ratingone Not reliable 
len ratingfive I started my business years ago 
len ratingfive I have seen it all 
len ratingfive Google Drive is THE most amazing tool created for Small business 
len ratingfive Making it possible to share docs and more with anyone in the world for free was and still is an incredible asset 
len ratingfive Steve Barraza tianello com
len ratingfive Goggles
len ratingfive This is such an AMAZING APP I love IT it help me a lot thank you so much 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive I do love this app but I do think that we could make some changes I would rather be able to delete some of the files 
len ratingfive I do like being able to see what my teachers are putting for us 
len ratingfive Thx for the great app
len ratingfive Google Drive is when it s for school apps like google slide and google doc
len ratingtwo I can t move pictures I can t even get a Text box 
len ratingtwo When I try to move something it NEVER works 
len ratingfive It s the best
len ratingone This is causing us both stress 
len ratingone ABSOLUTE JUNK 
len ratingone This app will not allow background uploading which makes it almost completely useless 
len ratingone You can only upload or back up your iPhone data when the iOS Google Drive app is OPEN AND SHOWING ON YOUR SCREEN 
len ratingone That means you CANNOT DO ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR PHONE 
len ratingone Considering the fact that a tiny little video of just a few minutes length could take an hour or more to upload regardless of what network you are on 
len ratingone  and if you want to back up say videos you ve taken on a family outing you re SCREWED because this means you won t be able to use your phone for hours 
len ratingone And YYYEP even if you are let s say done with an upload backup and a call comes in that you HAVE to take or if your phone goes to sleep OMG 
len ratingone TURN OFF AUTO LOCK before using this app 
len ratingone  GUESS WHAT when you go back to the Google Drive screen you will find that the app has screwed you and you HAVE TO START ALL OVER meaning you just wasted the last hours of not having your phone 
len ratingone What a filthy disgusting and utterly UNUSABLE APP 
len ratingfive Currently the easiest way for our Team to share and collaborate 
len ratingfive I had a good time at google drive 
len ratingfive Since I got the Eric voice on Vyond aka GoAnimate 
len ratingfive My photos are so important to us and seeing them in this file is great 
len ratingfive Drive is easy to use and I know this because I use it at least times a day 
len ratingfive Sometimes more 
len ratingfive It s really convenient because you can access your documents from anywhere you go as long as it s saved in google drive 
len ratingfive So goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
len ratingfive Most used app on my phone 
len ratingfive I dots know what I would do without google drive access from anywhere and I can do homework anytime anywhere 
len ratingfive And its FREE
len ratingfive It is great to know that my work of putting together a list of my contacts is available on Google Drive 
len ratingfive  This app is user friendly and easy to use 
len ratingfive I love the option of having to save my files through the internet which I can access it almost anywhere as long as we have internet 
len ratingone Crashes a lot
len ratingfour It could easily be five stars if it weren t so awkward to navigate retrieve documents and find discard old or duplicate documents 
len ratingfour But I use it a lot and am glad I have it 
len ratingfour PeteLion
len ratingfive Good for school and also for homework
len ratingone Cannot search for keywords within a PDF document basic feature available on the Android version of this app and OneDrive for iOS 
len ratingfive  Thanks Google 
len ratingfive No more people can pretend they did did not leave a phone message 
len ratingfive Invaluable application 
len ratingone It takes forever to do stuff
len ratingfive Great job google
len ratingfive Dope af
len ratingfive I love it it helps me keep stuff organized and if I don t have storage I can put it here or google photos
len ratingfive Is there any way for locking this app itself only without locking my iPad Any one can help please thanks
len ratingfive I can use google drive one multiple devices this helps me in school when I need to print items from a laptop to another device
len ratingfive Med student and I tried several apps to open my organic chemistry project in but was not able to open it 
len ratingfive Thanks My Drive so moving forward I will utilize this app 
len ratingfive I called Chief he said this is it
len ratingfive I am deeply in love
len ratingtwo She says to turn right when she means left please fix 
len ratingfive Love how easy Google is to learn and use 
len ratingtwo iOS files compatibility is critical if you want to open and edit a file in it s native format 
len ratingtwo Google Drive integrates within iOS files to some degree but there is not even any mention of team drives which are a major function of our workflow 
len ratingthree  Please update the app for the new all display iPad Pro as soon as possible 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfive I cannot express how much I love Google drive 
len ratingfive I use it everyday and has never failed me 
len ratingfive  times better than iCloud 
len ratingfive This is great because I can connect all my files to one app 
len ratingfive I struggled before finding documents because some would be on my computer or iPad 
len ratingfive Now I can find them quicker and anywhere 
len ratingfive I do not always have something with me so I can sign into my account on any device and then all my files will be there 
len ratingfive Good apps you should try Google docs Google slides Google sheets Gmail Google chrome
len ratingfive I love this
len ratingone I created a folder to add videos so that I don t have to keep them in my camera roll 
len ratingone They are downloaded but they don t play when I m trying to watch them
len ratingfive Google Drive is an amazing tool to share files with friends 
len ratingfive Its really good for school and in general 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Quick efficient way to share and save pictures with my family and friends 
len ratingfive Easy access through the APP even for this Grandma 
len ratingfive Love his APP 
len ratingfour This app is wonderful however time from time the app force closes for no reason and it sorta makes me a little mad when it happens if a fix could happen sooner then later that would be great 
len ratingfour There is a notification that I can t get rid of and I do not know how to delete it 
len ratingfour There is like a permanent on the corner of the drive app on my iPhone
len ratingthree It d be great if I could actually add people to a file through the app all the time but most of the time I can t 
len ratingthree It freezes that function entirely too often for my needs 
len ratingfive Works as intended
len ratingfive The drive is the best writing system thingy that I ever used before 
len ratingfive It lets you write multiple pieces and stores them only a few taps away if your devices get broken you can just log into your email on another one 
len ratingfive It is so cool it is so cool it is so cool it is so cool it is so cool it is so cool it is so cool I love it 
len ratingfive  Best add on 
len ratingfive Simplest tool for extra storage access anytime from anywhere much like having an IBM Computer on cart wheels IBM Main Frame If I can use it this well then anybody can and simplest
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfour I m not really a fan that in order to edit your documents you have to get a whole other app 
len ratingfour It would be a lot more simple if you could read and edit all of your documents on one app 
len ratingone Absolutely hate the app 
len ratingone Ever since I downloaded I ve been having issues sharing my documents 
len ratingfive It is so good totes love it 
len ratingone I am trying to help my sister wedding plan and being able to share documents with family is crucial 
len ratingone I also use the Drive app for my work documents when I m on the road 
len ratingone Every time in the last week I ve tried to open the app it immediately crash closes 
len ratingone I ve restarted my phone and just updated the app too and it s still doing it 
len ratingone Very disappointing 
len ratingfour What about loop play for mps 
len ratingone Unreliable
len ratingfive I like it very much 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone Very gud deserves a star
len ratingone  Your app doesn t help and doesn t work why can t I share a file
len ratingfive stars
len ratingone Trash
len ratingfive Awesomeness 
len ratingthree  Since google has been hacked and I don t have any faith in Google anymore why am earth would you give me such a spurious exclamation for an upgrade 
len ratingthree Seriously I think Amazon does a better job than Google I m thinking of changing based on facts and Google fiction
len ratingtwo I cant edit my drives that I made on my computer on the app which is very annoying and makes app useless
len ratingfive It s super handy when collaborating with others 
len ratingfive The only thing I ask is for the ability to rename files from mobile as well as from the desktop site 
len ratingfive Succinctly stated I absolutely love Google Drive and it has become an indispensable part of my life 
len ratingfive I give it a five star rating and would double that if were possible 
len ratingfive Of all the file storage and sync services Google Drive utility is the best and most reliable 
len ratingfive If the free storage is not enough for you you can buy more 
len ratingfive Additional extra space starts at less than per month 
len ratingfive None of the others can match the price or flexibility 
len ratingfour  Is there any possibility of syncing the google photos app with drive 
len ratingfour Can that be implemented in a future update or am I just dumb 
len ratingfive It s an easy access and quick 
len ratingfive Which is what I love if I need to save something really quickly or if I need to open it again 
len ratingtwo  Pp poopoo
len ratingone App doesn t work as it used to do in the past 
len ratingfive Excelent
len ratingone I was trying to upload pics but it never completed
len ratingfive Bring able to create share and then save documents makes planning and collaboration easy 
len ratingfive Not having to switch back and forth between applications to get my work done is much appreciated 
len ratingfive The collaboration feature of Google Docs saves so much time that the old send cut and paste resend over and over is thankfully in my rear view mirror 
len ratingfive Having everything in one place in my drive makes locating desired documents a breeze 
len ratingfour  This is a pretty good application I m able to store watch cartoons offline 
len ratingfour Only thing they could add is the option to cast mp files to a TV
len ratingfive I think drive is a great way to save your documents without worry as it automatically saves even when power cuts out unlike other document companies 
len ratingfive This is also an amazing app for slides and saving pictures 
len ratingfive There system is advanced and that is why I rated it a 
len ratingfive As a young student I found this app very useful 
len ratingfive A teacher can access your folders and your teacher can see the documents you have done for your class 
len ratingfive I have been using this app for about three years and it has not disappointed me yet 
len ratingfive I hope it serves you well too 
len ratingfive Laia Guyard Suengas
len ratingfour It s not good if you just wanting right it s best fo storing your writeings
len ratingfive  Hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi hi hi hi
len ratingfive It helps me with school I LUV IT 
len ratingfive Organizes everything well 
len ratingfive  thank you very much for helping me do my work 
len ratingthree I am using it for a class 
len ratingthree When students submit a paper I like to be notified 
len ratingthree I believe I am setting the notification 
len ratingthree But no notifications coming through 
len ratingone Does not support the proper iPhone XR Resolution
len ratingfive Honestly really easy to use 
len ratingfive I use it for holding photography and cinematography stuff for school and work it s easy to share with people and I can literally access it whenever with my phone 
len ratingthree  good app but a slight problem 
len ratingthree no matter what account i get on there is always an error when i try to change my profile picture 
len ratingfive  free cloud gigs whaaat
len ratingfive I dunno it just works 
len ratingfive I love how you can do something on your computer and then transfer it to your phone iPad without hassle 
len ratingfive Thank you for building products that add value 
len ratingone  Get it together Google 
len ratingone You re paid way too much not code this simple function into the app 
len ratingone ONE STAR 
len ratingfive  Gracias
len ratingfive I love saving documents on my phone and are Abe to access them anywhere I go 
len ratingfive This is a really good app 
len ratingfive Google drive is very helpful for my school work 
len ratingfive I don t know what I would do without it 
len ratingfive This is a great way to organize my files and go from place to place and use them in multiple locations 
len ratingfive It s very convenient for me 
len ratingone I had the same app on my android and the speed of loading sound or music was considerably faster 
len ratingone What s going on 
len ratingthree  On many occasions now if I open a video in Google drive I am unable to close the video without restarting the app 
len ratingtwo Please organize the files and folders better 
len ratingfive I just love having access to my files on my phone as well as on my computers at work and at home 
len ratingone  Google Drive is an outdated app that upscales low resolution content for new iPhones 
len ratingone The app is blurry and unusable 
len ratingfive There was an emptiness in my life that for years I attributed to an unhappy marriage and kids whose mere existence was like nails on a chalkboard 
len ratingfive No amount of alcohol drugs or hookers would fill that void 
len ratingfive Many years and bouts of herpes scabs later I had reached my wits end and hired a divorce attorney 
len ratingfive He suggested I look into Google Drive before proceeding with such a major decision which I did and noticed immediate results 
len ratingfive Within seconds of using Google Drive I realized I hadn t wasted years of my life in a sexless wasteland of a marriage 
len ratingfive Rather I wasted years of my life using other substandard file storage and synchronization services 
len ratingfive Google drive has complete transformed my marriage and my relationship with my kids 
len ratingfive Happily I can say that today my life is much more organized and easily managed thanks to Google Drive 
len ratingfive Oh and my wife now has butt herpes 
len ratingthree This app has a lot of bugs 
len ratingthree It s been difficult for me to upload things onto it 
len ratingfour Wish you guys would ve also invented google one for Apple
len ratingfive Have used it for years and found it a good way to manage written music and other files 
len ratingthree It s going to make Slide shows and paragraphs with it but it deletes my writing and add random spaces for no reason and it s really annoying
len ratingthree It does what I need it to do for the most part but the app is super slow and glitchy 
len ratingthree Sometimes I can t get audio files to play or make them available offline 
len ratingthree I just get the Error 
len ratingthree Try again later message which is really frustrating 
len ratingfour Many things are great with google Drive however when it shows in red I have a new shared unread file and I have opened that file Drive still displays the red sign for unread file 
len ratingfour I JUST got done figuring how to stop photos from overflowing my iCloud GB and now my GB of Google Drive keeps loading with more full resolution photos when I clear space 
len ratingfour I DON T want to stop syncing optimized photos wish I owned a PIXEL XL like my partner sometimes to get unlimited full resolution in Google Photos itself but unfortunately with Android having one half and Microsoft having the other the rest to the hand off and syncing of photos to my Mac notes to my Mac so minute I walk in the door I can sit down and everything is already there 
len ratingfour THEN I still don t have to touch my iPhone b c I can text from my Mac answer and make calls from my Mac etc 
len ratingfour I m just not ready for a Chrome OS laptop world so I am stuck preferring ANY Pixel XL WITHOUT A NOTCH over an iPhone but unable to ever give up my MacBook Pro so the story continues 
len ratingfour I think I fixed the Google Drive overflow today but I ve yet to prove it and I had to google instructions so the GUI was NOT naturally intuitive enough to stop without help my biggest complaint 
len ratingthree I have used this app for school a lot and times this year it has reverted back to the version I had before I did all the work 
len ratingthree This is especially annoying when it happens on a hour s worth of edits only to revert without me knowing and me getting a C for not making any revisions 
len ratingthree Tonight I had to do minutes worth of research for homework and everything I saved to the document was lost to the old template I made in school 
len ratingthree This only happens on the IPad as far as I know but please fix this it is killing me 
len ratingone Updated a doc this morning updates don t show on drive for iPad so I am wasting time reinstalling Drive 
len ratingone More crap from google
len ratingfive If I m really honest Google is the platform that runs my life 
len ratingfive Calendars and mail are part of the core but Drive is even more of a foundation 
len ratingfive I have a scanner pushing all of my mail and important documents into a folder so I can search for them what s the name of the IKEA mattress we bought two years ago 
len ratingfive I seamlessly sync all of my nursing school files 
len ratingfive My wife and I share planning docs and files for our house remodel 
len ratingfive I guess there are competitors like Box and Dropbox but none of them are as solid as Google 
len ratingfive If the CDC can use Drive to sync Ebola combat efforts across Africa I should be able to use it to keep my own stuff together 
len ratingfive My only request as it has been for years is to allow tags 
len ratingfive Very easy to navigate even for dinosaurs 
len ratingfive Wonderful for work as an excellent storage for both photos and documents with an easy share option for work teams or groups of friends 
len ratingfive Suggest always to colleagues using word 
len ratingfive Prefer drive 
len ratingfive A real winning platform for grant app prep and more 
len ratingfive Nice to have all my documents in one place 
len ratingfive Great stuff butt things need be good where needuse availability plus use an access to for flexibility snatch optimization files documentation ICE immigration wrongful deportation racist slap on the cocksuxer Donald Trump 
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfive Great app and easy to use 
len ratingfive The utility of a drive cloud changes the way business and computer use is done 
len ratingfive Thanks for creating it 
len ratingfive Please keep it secure 
len ratingone Super slow speed in loading and editing
len ratingfive Thank you For Everything Good My Drive 
len ratingfive I drive
len ratingfive Loosing everything but your breath in a fire is devastating finding pictures of your children in your Google Drive after everything is gone PRICELESS Thank You Google
len ratingfive Love this app and how efficient it is 
len ratingfive It truly helps my company communicate effectively and we easily are able to store important documents 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Drive 
len ratingfive Because Apple hasn t opened its vintage ipads and friends to open source developers there are real limits for aging ipad technology 
len ratingfive Google s proactive support of fundamental apps on all devices like vintage ipads gives ipads new life and helps prevent toxic tech waste 
len ratingfive Thank you Googlers 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone For some reason it won t let me download anything to my camera roll on my iPhone it s not that hard you click and save nothing happens big waste of time with this app 
len ratingone PDF files are difficult to open
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive for years 
len ratingfive Drive allows me to keep all my docs and spreadsheets in one place 
len ratingfive So easy to use and works cross platforms seamlessly 
len ratingfive Thank you GOOGLE

len ratingfour It s like a closet that can fit everything but unless you are orderly initially it can get unruly 
len ratingfive Has all the google files in one place easy to access 
len ratingfive I think that it s awesome because I can download my files in here and some of my songs
len ratingone I rely on Google drive to work on my phone 
len ratingone While it worked great with iPhone s it does not with iPhone XS 
len ratingone I am unable to scroll to the bottom of excel pages where I need to make entries 
len ratingone This application is terrible at sharing a document and having it functionally open easily and maintain formatting 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingtwo How to download original photo to Camera scroll in Photos app

len ratingthree I used to love Google Drive it made saving my files across platforms so easy 
len ratingthree But for days now I ve been trying to save a second mov file to my iPhone on iOS 
len ratingthree It just says its processing and downloading either that goes on forever or eventually it just stopped and nothing is saved to my phone 
len ratingthree It s extremely agitating 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfive Good bro
len ratingfive My Drive meets all of my needs 
len ratingfive It offers competitive storage rates easy access and organization and syncs across all of my devices 
len ratingfive Worth the cost to be sure 
len ratingfive  Leaving my charger for my Cannon camera a thousand miles away left my camera worthless for vacation 
len ratingfive So I used my iPhone instead 
len ratingfive When I returned home I was so worried about saving the images to my non apple laptop as they were HEIC images from Apple 
len ratingfive Thank you Google Drive for being able to uploading the images then either saving those images as HEIC or JPEG 
len ratingfive I chose JPEG and downloaded and saved them to files in my desktop and laptop 
len ratingfive Another outstanding job by Goggle while Microsoft sits I by idle not doing anything 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive Docs slides since first grade 
len ratingfive Good functioning fast server and the tools are easy to find

len ratingfive I can easily access my family s files from anywhere on any device 
len ratingfive The add on options are helpful when I need them 
len ratingfive I love the sharing option and how you can choose the individual s privileges 
len ratingfive It has come in handy many times when my husband is at work and has something to save that I may need 
len ratingfive Or my middle schooler forgot his homework on the table so I scan it in on his drive so he can access at school and I don t have to cart my toddler in to drop it off

len ratingfive I couldn t business the way I do now without it 
len ratingfive Like it very much
len ratingfive This is a good app

len ratingfive I m a changed woman 
len ratingfive This app made me whole 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive I would marry it if I could 
len ratingfive Jk I m bored and writing this during class 
len ratingtwo  Slow as ever and doesn t allow you to edit it right there you have to go into the other app
len ratingone Waste of bandwidth with updates wow 
len ratingone How fat do you need to make your apps 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfour  Where are the new icons like the newest Google Docs
len ratingfive Since I don t have a computer at home this app on my phone really helps 
len ratingfive I get to do all my work here and also I get it done 
len ratingfive And I don t fail my teachers on not doing my work because now I do it on my phone thanks to Google drive on my phone 
len ratingfive Don t know how I would function without it
len ratingthree It s good but limited to the iPhone
len ratingfive So google drive works really well I personally have no problems with it 
len ratingfive It is great 
len ratingfive  Really clean and simple but sometimes confusing to use on a phone but overall great 
len ratingfive I love drive 
len ratingfive Makes it so easy to transfer things from computer to my phone
len ratingfour The app s okay but when I try to make files available online they don t become available immediately the check mark showing that the file s now online doesn t show up until the next few times I use the app 
len ratingfive  It is good 
len ratingone Got a link 
len ratingone Didn t work 
len ratingfive The Drive is the easiest way to upload and access pretty much anything
len ratingfive Gracias por ser calidad en lo que son y hacer de nosotros usuarios confiados en la protecci n de nuestros archivos y memoriales 
len ratingfive Mil gracias 
len ratingfive Mwah aha
len ratingfive  I use Drive all the time and for almost everything 
len ratingfive Multiple people logged on Drive to communicate and edit projects is awesome and saves time too 
len ratingfive Keeping recorded memos in Drive is a plus also 
len ratingfive Thanks developers for a job well done 
len ratingthree To me that feature is important 
len ratingthree Dropbox has it which is very helpful and convenient 
len ratingthree I heard google drive for android has it 
len ratingthree Why not for iOS 
len ratingthree All the app offers you is use camera which is not convenient because you are not able to crop from within the app and be able to scan in PDF 
len ratingthree Google please add this feature 
len ratingthree This is making go back to Dropbox 
len ratingfive I ve been using Drive for a while now 
len ratingfive It s outstanding 
len ratingfive I literally have no complaints or suggestions 
len ratingfive Great job 
len ratingfive Best drive app
len ratingfive This is good for school projects 
len ratingfive That s why I really enjoyed it 
len ratingone Very finicky of when and what and when it syncs
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Drive is great 
len ratingfive You can do so many different things on it like writing documents making presentations creating forms and lots of other stuff 
len ratingfive There are so many different options to use in all of the creations 
len ratingfive My personal favorite is a tie between Slides Drawings and Forms 
len ratingfive Drive is the best 
len ratingfive It s google drive 
len ratingfive It rocks 
len ratingthree I can t make videos available offline 
len ratingthree they just don t play after making them available offline 
len ratingthree When I try to play them they just show a sideways play symbol with a cross going through it 
len ratingthree I want this fixed 
len ratingthree I don t think there should be a limit on video playback 
len ratingthree which if is exceeded it gives me an error saying the video can t play the allowed video playback limited was exceeded 
len ratingfive This app is for people who want to transfer images to the iPad or I phone from device to device 
len ratingthree  I can t make videos available offline 
len ratingthree they just don t play after making them available offline 
len ratingthree When I try to play them they just show a sideways play symbol with a cross going through it 
len ratingthree I want this fixed 
len ratingthree  Everytime I make videos available offline the videos won t play instead the videos show a play symbol with a cross through it in my face until I reinstall google drive 
len ratingthree And if I access them from the computer the videos become not available offline so I have to do the work of making the videos available offline again and then reinstalling the app because the videos won t play 
len ratingthree I want this fixed 
len ratingfive No lie This app has simplified my life both professionally and personally 
len ratingfive It s like having a virtual hard drive at your disposal and maintaining the same level of organization with your files or documents 
len ratingfive Drag n drop is so flawless and a preview of your uploads and actions always in view making it as user friendly as one would expect even better than the other cloud 
len ratingtwo I have music files mp 
len ratingtwo It bothers me that we cannot play then all 
len ratingtwo I have to individually play each file 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingone  Cannot connect google home M
len ratingfive Google Drive has been a great asset 
len ratingfive I thank Google for a utility that is incredibly capable and free 
len ratingfive Literally
len ratingfive  My best experience with using Google Drive 
len ratingfive I use UpWord a note taking app and I create some PDF s from the notes or stories I write 
len ratingfive Also I even make lists from UpWord and make them into PDF s in Drive 
len ratingfive Also I even record and upload videos to Drive 
len ratingfive I even record and upload recordings from an audio editing app 
len ratingfive Sometimes I usually upload songs from a music making app called GarageBand 
len ratingfive I uploaded two songs from GarageBand to Drive today 
len ratingfive I also tried to upload a Bible devotional to Drive but it said that it was an unsupported filetype 
len ratingfive That s okay because maybe I can save it to another app and try to upload it to Drive from that app 
len ratingfive But I know that Google Drive is so much better with Google Docs 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a good app for sure 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfive If you want to read my review you can look through the recent reviews from most favorable 
len ratingfive That s how you can find this good app 
len ratingfive It was a joy to listen to Max Shakun s rendition of I Will 
len ratingfive The combination of his voice with the notes if his guitar created beautiful smooth listening 
len ratingfive I loved it 
len ratingfive It s the best
len ratingtwo You have to set the whole iPhone language setting to Chinese mode in order to be able to edit
len ratingone Spam spam spam 
len ratingone Garbage control over online criminals unanswered tech support requests technical excellence with terrible spam control 
len ratingthree I m a video editor and I make my videos on my MacBook I use google drive to send the video edits to my phone but it never lets me save it directly to my camera roll 
len ratingthree I always have to screen recording and it makes the quality look bad and when I post it in on instagram it looks even worse but it s great for sending things and saving storage 
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingthree Mediocre 
len ratingthree Not easy enough to navigate and u can t edit drawings or forums 
len ratingthree But it is easy to just go look at a doc for reference 
len ratingthree That is useful 
len ratingthree Please make it less sensitive and more user friendly 
len ratingthree The computer version is rad though 
len ratingthree Make this live up to its computerie cousin then me gives full stars 
len ratingthree Bye Bye
len ratingfive Lol
len ratingfive This app saved me many times I don t have a printer so when I need to save goes straight to Drive 
len ratingfive I send a copy to my work email and then I can print thank you 
len ratingfour I love having this curated storage 
len ratingfour It is easy to use 
len ratingfour I miss the security of having an additional password 
len ratingfour I was totally annoyed by Apple iPhone s storage 
len ratingfour Every I have to sign in and increase the capacity of the storage 
len ratingfour I was fed up 
len ratingfour Now let me see how google working for me 
len ratingfive Good and convenient interface
len ratingfive Works on both Android and IOS keeps me connected to my files 
len ratingone Opened app and signed in to my Google account 
len ratingone Went to backup 
len ratingone Selected the files I wanted to backup 
len ratingone Touched backup now 
len ratingone Says backup complete 
len ratingone Can not find those files anywhere on Google Drive 
len ratingtwo This version does not let look at the folders I use on my laptop 
len ratingfive Great access and view
len ratingone Can t edit documents
len ratingfive Google Drive really makes the process of sharing files a breeze 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfour Does not have much choice is especially on Google slides 
len ratingfour can t save videos to camera roll 
len ratingfive Google drive is the best 
len ratingfive I rate it because it helps me do my school work at home so it won t be late due 
len ratingfive This app is Awesome and so easy to use 
len ratingfive Thanks again
len ratingfour Learning how to use
len ratingone Google government don t trust them 
len ratingfive Use it for everything It s great And keeps getting greater
len ratingfour I use this app to store photos graphics everything basically so I can avoid storing items on my iPad and using up my GBs 
len ratingfour The only thing I wish this app could do is be able to use multi select of files to import files as photos on my ipad for when I need o work with them on my ipad 
len ratingfour Instead I have to do it by which is a pain 
len ratingfive  Great for group projects organizing files and events 
len ratingfive Good tool for students and professionals alike 
len ratingone When zoom in on document such as PDF to read the document is glitching 
len ratingone This is new issue with most recent update 
len ratingtwo Everything is all over the place and I can t find an easy way to exit the videos because the x symbol won t show up properly 
len ratingtwo I should be doing my homework right now but instead I m stuck here righting reviews on your app that needs work 
len ratingthree I mostly use drive for listening to music and audiobooks the only problem is that if there are two audio files next to each other when one finishes the other won t start playing immediately I m fairly certain it used to do this but fir some reason it doesn t anymore if this could be changed it would definitely just improve the overall experience 
len ratingfive This app is so useful and quick 
len ratingfive Whenever I need to print something or make a project I come here 
len ratingfive You can also have different types of paper and tools 
len ratingfive It also saves automatically 
len ratingfive I Love this app
len ratingfive  So awhile back I had an iPod gen and one day it shut off completely and I lost all my photos in it because I couldn t unlock it and I forgot to save them to iCloud or google photos 
len ratingfive It s been about years since I d last seen them 
len ratingfive But today I realize that I could still access the photos with my iPod to my computer so I connected my iPod to my computer and opened the file with all my photos and I dragged all of them to Google drive and now all I have to do is upload them to Google Photos 
len ratingfive Then I will have had all my photos back for my iPod and I m really grateful for this app 
len ratingfive It has brought back so many memories and old photos looking at some of them made me tear up and this app is really simple to use in your phone or computer definitely recommend using it 
len ratingfive I like it because it works great and the only time I m on it is now 
len ratingfive Convenient for family sharing 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingthree  Uploads should preserve file time should not lock up crash when selecting large number of photos and movies items allow picking all photos in a group similar to built in photo app eg all photos on Tuesday 
len ratingfive  Love this app 
len ratingfive It s so easy to use and does everything I need without using the cloud
len ratingfive It s very good and useful for many different reasons it s not only easy to use but also comparatively a great app 
len ratingone It doesn t cast personal videos to Chromecast 
len ratingthree I loved it T first but it kept logging me out
len ratingfive  I like this 
len ratingone Some files are not supported on iPhone 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone A friend sent me a zipped photos but I can t download them 
len ratingone Mention unsupported files 
len ratingone At the same time it works on android phone 
len ratingthree Google really needs to implement D touch features 
len ratingthree Drive and Doc apps are running so behind 
len ratingthree This multi billion dollar corporation neglects improving features on their iPhone apps 
len ratingthree I love that it s free but come on Google you gotta add more features 
len ratingfour  Most be faster is kind of slow loading
len ratingfour Drive is awesome 
len ratingfour I love drive 
len ratingfour It helps a lot 
len ratingfive  Once I have a pic loaded up into my account it ready to be seen within a few seconds on another device 
len ratingfive You got this setup great Google good job 
len ratingthree I use this for work 
len ratingthree It s by far the best cloud option and there s not much to discuss here 
len ratingthree But there s a problem The app has been using hours of battery time in the background with absolutely nothing going on 
len ratingthree My phone is heating up pretty badly and the battery panel points to this app working on the background on really odd hours like the middle of the night even if I hadn t uploaded anything on the last h 
len ratingthree Gotta fix this otherwise I ll be forced to start looking for alternatives 
len ratingthree And by the way background app refresh is off for this 
len ratingone I ve been patiently waiting from when ios was released for a bug free drive app 
len ratingone Never happened 
len ratingone Images won t load after a while Folders won t open up No details on file info Crashes 
len ratingone Images won t load yes it s that bad 
len ratingone Get it together google 
len ratingfour After msn photobucket shutting down 
len ratingfour I ve been worried but feel comfort with coogle drive 
len ratingfive Love how it saves everything automatically 
len ratingfive It also shows when you were on and the changes you have made 
len ratingfive I love drive I use drive for everything I do 
len ratingfive It works like a charm 
len ratingfive Google helps you to create a better view of the world based on your experience 
len ratingfive Wonderful software 
len ratingfive Very convenient app

len ratingtwo I really hate how you can t even edit your documents 
len ratingtwo You have to get another app just to do that 
len ratingone OneDrive and Dropbox is much better than useless data eater and not orderly Google Drive 
len ratingone Had to wait for thumbnail to show a little picture before click on for a full size picture 
len ratingone So friggin time consuming searching for one measly picture 
len ratingone Plus it messed up your timeline by putting all the same dates on picture the day you either update or upload when it is not 
len ratingone What a moron that Google is 
len ratingone If iPhone does have ability of having mirco SD cards I would tell Google to kiss my bottom and never looking back because mirco SD cars show the picture immediately 
len ratingone OneDrive and Dropbox you only have to wait less than a second for the thumbnail show a little picture unlike GoogleDrive which is average seconds delay for each friggin thumbnail 
len ratingone Not impressed 
len ratingone Got super fast internet and great iPhone 
len ratingone So it is GoogleDrive s end itself that messed the whole thing or poorly executed software 
len ratingone Bre
len ratingfive Google drive is GREAT for school work 
len ratingone  I made a spreadsheet on my desktop full of data with a chart to visually demonstrate that data 
len ratingone I could see and edit the chart on my desktop but when I tried later viewing the chart on my iPhone nothing appeared as if the chart I made never existed 
len ratingone This bug needs to be fixed 
len ratingfour As I would like but a solid way to share info without multiple copies floating around 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive I have been able to save many old photos to view any time I want and can set to friends and family 
len ratingone I would like to test drive the car where can i meet you with my team of test drivers and mechanics 
len ratingone I can be there by this saturday 
len ratingfive Helpful secure 
len ratingfive  Rubella
len ratingfive Google drive is amazing 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingthree Google drive is okay goodnight people of the world
len ratingfive im trabsgebder and i work in film and television 
len ratingfive i like being able too store my most imprtant documents like my resume and phots 
len ratingfive it really helpa being abe to add them to emails and share them 
len ratingfive i love drive app 
len ratingfive it des a good job cutting down my clutter 
len ratingfive i hate having so much paper around and i truly enjoy having a digital copy 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfour I use Google Drive all the time and recommend to my clients 
len ratingfour The only thing I m not liking at the moment is the Save Image feature when you press on an image seems to have gone away 
len ratingfive Gracias
len ratingfive  Google Drive is life that is all 
len ratingfive Makes life wayyy easier 
len ratingthree Even with limited knowledge easy to navigate
len ratingfour Easy to organize 
len ratingfour Glad to be able to download and to store wide variety of things e g slides photos docs 
len ratingfour Clean look and relatively easy controls 
len ratingfour Only request is to be able to manipulate the margins of documents it seems impossible to do so on the phone even when the doc is on the print format style 
len ratingfive Easily the most important app I have 
len ratingfive I d be lost without it 
len ratingfive Thank you for safely keeping all of my files 
len ratingfive Organization I work for is still fairly young but we use all of the great programs google offers even from my iPhone 
len ratingone Drive makes it really easy to transfer folders out or to another app but maddeningly difficult to transfer the folder back 
len ratingone I can move the files individually but I can t seem to just move the whole folder back in 
len ratingone What the crap 
len ratingone Files and OneDrive do this seamlessly and more importantly intuitively 
len ratingone I tried something in those apps that I thought would accomplish the task and guess what it worked 
len ratingone Not so with GDrive 
len ratingone Confounded and disappointed 
len ratingfive Saves my butt everyday Are use Drive probably times a day every day it is so useful in handy to pull up all the notes docs pics videos that I create
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive Yayyy
len ratingfive I love google docs it s been great for sharing information with classmates and storage all my information I need quick access to 
len ratingfive I have so much on her and the space is amazing 
len ratingfive I ve used google drive for over years and the features are getting better and better
len ratingfive This is what I was looking for 
len ratingfive Drive always helps me with my homework and I always appreciate having something to trust on 
len ratingtwo Everything works very perfect except for the downloading feature 
len ratingtwo I uploaded a video from my desktop to google drive then went on my iPad Pro and tried downloading it and it doesn t work and when I try sharing on instagram it doesn t work either 
len ratingfive Drive let s me access my google account from my iPhone 
len ratingfive It is super helpful on the go 
len ratingfive I m So Proud Of Google The Google Family For This Wonderful app 
len ratingfive I Can Finally Save Everything That I Won t For A Very Nominal Cost 
len ratingfive Like I say With Gary s Road House Mixers Go Google Thanks Again For All The Good Things In Life 
len ratingfive Bye Bye from Gary 
len ratingfive So Basically This Is Epic
len ratingfive Good app for transferring files from any of your smart devices to your drive 
len ratingfive Communication going green through google classroom 
len ratingfive I m rich SEBAS
len ratingtwo  This app doesn t work the same way as Drive File Stream on desktop folders cannot be chosen to keep offline thus it is pointless to have portable device and not able to use it traveling without internet connection 
len ratingfive The most beautiful thing I ve ever seen 
len ratingone My wedding photographer sent me our wedding photos in Google drive and I can t figure out how to get them out of here so I can do something with them 
len ratingone I d like to think I m pretty technologically savvy but it s been frustrating for weeks 
len ratingfive Awesome easy to make good looking presentations
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfour  Not as good as Dropbox but as I have an Android device I enjoy the Google One features should be on iOS as well 
len ratingfour It s great to options 
len ratingfour Google drive is a great way to do work and at home stuff 
len ratingfour My only complaint is when I m doing work on my tablet it doesn t let me use online pictures and many other things you would get on a computer 
len ratingfive Helpful for typing you scrips for YouTube and stuff like that
len ratingfive Thanks for updating this regularly
len ratingtwo  SE ve con Zoom 
len ratingfive Please advice 
len ratingfive I m able to share in Google drive the mega app is trash 
len ratingfour For anyone who s already used a pc or Microsoft this will be very familiar only it offers more options of convenience 
len ratingfour On the other hand it too is plagued by this whole idea of exclusivity of files and converting sending and sharing on different platforms is too complicated for users like me who have only a basic understanding of computers 
len ratingfive love google for making drive so easy to use 
len ratingone Taking long time to download video
len ratingone  The most useful feature holding down on an image to save it is broken
len ratingone Nothing is better than my OneDrive app because at least with OneDrive I never need to risk my personal photos and information being stolen by Hackers by using city WiFi And because I don t own any WiFi they never force me to use any type of WiFi to download my personal information and with Google Drive I m literately forced to use WiFi even if it s a city WiFi And I don t own the WiFi and that s messed up so I ll stick to My OneDrive 
len ratingone Takes hours to upload a minute non had video 
len ratingfive There are sooooo many cool features that I can use everyday 
len ratingfive And it is simple to use even if you are just getting started 
len ratingfive Everything can be sorted out nicely with folders also so there is no cluttering 
len ratingfive If you are reading this and haven t downloaded this yet then what are you waiting for 
len ratingfive Thanks for marking this now I can post wolf online videos
len ratingfive I recently lost my New IPad mini to the last Hurricane 
len ratingfive Well I lost everything 
len ratingfive My Older IPad actually survived 
len ratingfive Everything I had is in my Google Drive 
len ratingfive I was scared I couldn t get access 
len ratingfive But The Older Download worked 
len ratingfive Google Kept the Old Version Not Everyone can just get up and buy a new IPad when you have to worry where You re going to live how you re going to feed your family and clothes them My Job was Destroyed to 
len ratingfive But the Older Download same me 
len ratingfive I can t think Google Enough For Keeping them 
len ratingfive Thank You Google Thank You for my Life again
len ratingfive I LOVE IT 
len ratingfive Good for school if you need to type something 
len ratingfive  Star
len ratingthree Need to development
len ratingone Not impressed 
len ratingone I m still trying to download information from 
len ratingone I found out this app and hoped it would work somehow on a Apple iPad I have t found a way yet 
len ratingfour I could see myself paying for more space 
len ratingthree This is confusing
len ratingone Ur bad
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfive  free space 
len ratingone This stuffy thingy dopey thingy is bad because I have to do school work on it and it s lame lol huehuehuehhuehueheu
len ratingfive Sweet
len ratingone I have been looking for pictures of soup and I asked google but it downloaded this 
len ratingone I tried to find soup but I found nothing 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingfive sc christianbeer
len ratingtwo what kind of silly message is that the file is there i searched you found there it is click in it something wrong sad
len ratingone Eat my cat you scientist
len ratingtwo why in this day age does Google Drive app not handle VIDEO SUBTITLES 
len ratingtwo how unprofessional unrealistic to user consumer demand 
len ratingtwo Programming is not Google s fort though it s not like the next Trillion co can not afford it 
len ratingtwo how disgustingly cheap Google is 
len ratingtwo Inconsistently the web browser version of GoogleDrive handles subtitles 
len ratingtwo Googly is too strange 
len ratingone previous version drive has pass lock option new version doesn t
len ratingone I ment stars 
len ratingone I don t know how to work this thing 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive everyday of my life 
len ratingfive Including school at home even on my phone 
len ratingfive I have never encountered an issue when it comes to using the app 
len ratingfive All my files are secure and uploaded within the cloud 
len ratingfive I love how easy it is to upload files 
len ratingfive Everything within the app is well organized 
len ratingfive Highly recommend using Google Drive for cloud storage 
len ratingfive  Thanks Google
len ratingtwo  Give us a clear easy to find download button for our pictures videos without having to dig through the menus to find it bring back the security feature with the passcode lock or I m canceling my premium account switching to dropbox 
len ratingtwo I shouldn t have to worry about the safety of all my files when others are using my phone 
len ratingfive Google is awesome
len ratingthree This app was very useful to access files on computers 
len ratingthree What I found disappointing was the fact of how difficult it was to view certain files and to edit particular files 
len ratingthree Overall I was highly satisfied with this app 
len ratingfive Good choice
len ratingfive Great to be able able to access files quickly and drive does just that
len ratingthree Google Drive is fantastic for file sharing and staying organized 
len ratingthree I gave this app a three star because many times when uploading images from my iPhone it only allows me to do at a time 
len ratingthree Huge waste of time

len ratingfour This is a great app for storing stuff but has some problems and bugs 
len ratingfour Still worth being free 
len ratingfour Sometimes slow
len ratingthree  Can t convert Drive document images to PDF or Word format unless they are already in Google Docs 
len ratingthree Put an easy to find Convert to PDF Word etc in the menu and you ll get stars from me 
len ratingfive Omg I love this app so much 
len ratingfive I love role playing with my friends and writing stories 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingone  Waste of bandwidth with updates wow 
len ratingone How fat do you need to make your apps 
len ratingtwo  The app itself as far as functionality is good 
len ratingtwo But considering this app can potentially have very sensitive information it s amazing a company like Google offers NO security options for neither the Drive nor Photos app 
len ratingfive Omg I haven t used this yet but all these good reports I m happy to see
len ratingone I have a Squarespace website for my business on which I have form submissions 
len ratingone I found out that you can have those submissions be auto populated into Google Drive spreadsheets so I created different ones for each location that I visit 
len ratingone I thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread because now I could view those spreadsheets from my phone on this app 
len ratingone Well wouldn t you know it the list for location shows up when I click on location s spreadsheet location shows up when I click on location etc etc etc 
len ratingone I m very disappointed that a company this large doesn t have their stuff together 
len ratingfour I m just gonna write something
len ratingtwo Long hard press doesn t save pic 
len ratingtwo I used to be able to 
len ratingtwo Why is this feature now gone 
len ratingfour I never understand the sharing options 
len ratingfour Seems to me it would be easiest to allow it to be shared and whatever 
len ratingfour And maybe have an option only to view
len ratingthree Folders don t always sync between devices 
len ratingthree Maybe it s user error 
len ratingfive A very well thought out and intuitive file system that works incredibly well on a mobile platform 
len ratingfive It even connects to printer apps and other such avenues to create truly a much simpler and easy to use system than anything from the early s 
len ratingthree  PDFs jump to full screen when scrolling or panning 
len ratingthree PDFs need to remain at the selected zoom until manually changed 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingthree The erratic zoom happens when a page break moves onto the screen a certain distance 
len ratingthree This is a major problem for viewing 
len ratingthree Will have to use other PDF viewers until fixed 
len ratingthree Older versions did not do that 
len ratingthree Please change back 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingone BALLS
len ratingtwo HTML editor and Java script editor are missing from the app too bad It would be nice to see you guys add these options to the app
len ratingthree All of a sudden I can t hold a photo to download it 
len ratingthree Bring this feature back 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone This app stops working often making its file unavailable on my computers and Apple devices 
len ratingfive It is great app I can get all of my things done easily and get to them easily 
len ratingfive  AWESOME 
len ratingfour Perfect for any storage need organization and work flow 
len ratingfour Love using Google s products over any other competitors it just works 
len ratingfour My only complaints though is that sometimes I am not able to download a photo to my phone from drive 
len ratingfour I m not sure why 
len ratingfour This is quite frustrating and I wish there was a big button on the menu that just says save to camera roll 
len ratingfour Otherwise it s great for school or regular work I appreciate the care for design and functionality 
len ratingfour I use Google slides and Google docs all the time 
len ratingfour As a photographer it is also super helpful 
len ratingfour The quality in images can reduce when transferring from one device to another which is quite annoying but still good enough quality for almost all uses 
len ratingone Is not letting me save in to my camera roll it use to
len ratingfive So thankful to be able to pull up documents to attach when out and about 
len ratingfive Makes life so much easier 
len ratingtwo It use to be easy to save photos from google drive to you iPhone by just holding your finger on the photo and then the option to save came up 
len ratingtwo Now had to search for this you have to tap the three dots on the top right choose send copy then chose save image too many steps 
len ratingtwo Even Dropbox is easier than this 
len ratingthree Being a photographer using google drive is an essential 
len ratingthree I ve been using this app four about five years now and it s been awesome 
len ratingthree Lately these last few months my phone can t handle the app 
len ratingthree It may be because I own an Iphone and it couldn t handle the newest update that s probably the most likely reason but lately I ve been having problems 
len ratingthree Trying to go through photos on my app especially high quality ones it literally just freezes and closes the app down 
len ratingthree And every time I ve restarted installed uninstalled the app does the same exact thing 
len ratingthree It s hell trying to download any photos or look through anything on my phone 
len ratingthree I may just need to buy a new phone but it s kinda weird that I could use this app pretty much this whole year until just lately 
len ratingthree Kinda just bummed 
len ratingfive Me he hecho fan de este App que util es 
len ratingfive Cumpre
len ratingone Can you get a folder s file size 
len ratingone One example of too many to count of how this app is a terrible 
len ratingone File browsers have been around for decades and we know what makes a good one 
len ratingone Or at least we know what the bottom bar is 
len ratingone And these companies don t even try when it comes to file management apps on iOS 
len ratingone App used to be amazing but the recent update removed the ability to quickly and easily save photos to the iPhone 
len ratingone You used to be able to press your finger on the screen for to save 
len ratingone What used to be a second process to save is now seconds of fumbling through menus to save 
len ratingone When you are dealing with hundreds of photos it s completely useless now 
len ratingone I will be searching for a new app to handle photos now 
len ratingfive This is great 
len ratingfive Just as easy as the browser version 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Excellent app but will this app have the ability to cast the offline videos to Chromecast 
len ratingfive Please add Chromecast to make this app complete
len ratingfive When i got this app i was so excited 
len ratingfive This app helps a lot for school and just in general 
len ratingfive I would totally recommend this app 
len ratingone  If the data is in the cloud why is so much data being used on my devices 
len ratingone There shouldn t be any Documents Data on the device but there is a substantial amount 
len ratingone The app deserves star until this is fixed 
len ratingfive The Best iCloud thanks 
len ratingfive Good for school work and very organized
len ratingfive GooN j interviens t gum fifdefdefdegdegged
len ratingfive A 
len ratingfive Great for getting organized 
len ratingfive Has definitely made my life much more efficient 
len ratingfour Hello I like what you have been doing with drive 
len ratingfour I would like to see a slightly more fluid accessibility when creating personal maps 
len ratingfive Very nice
len ratingfour I m finding Google Drive very useful and getting better and better at using it 
len ratingfour It seems that the interface with other Google apps may be very good but I m not sure yet 
len ratingfour It may be only my ineptitude but the UI seems less then UF user friendly and assumes all of us out here are already IT experts 
len ratingfour As I experiment and fail over and over I get better and better at using it 
len ratingfour Right now I m still learning 
len ratingfour I think Google has something to learn from Apple here as it s much easier to figure out how to organize things on iCloud 
len ratingtwo Upsetting that I can click on a photo to save to my phone camera roll 
len ratingtwo But I have to take the long route of getting the link to save a video to my camera roll 
len ratingtwo And use a video downloader to save it What the hell 
len ratingone  I deleted everything what took all the space and I still do t have storage i can t get Important gmails because of this Google please fix this issue ASAP 
len ratingtwo For some strange reason the Google Drive app quits unexpectedly each time I browse through my files 
len ratingtwo I don t know why that happens but it turns out to be very inconvenient since that s where I keep all my photos to share with my clients 
len ratingtwo Please Google fix this bug so we can enjoy our experience with the app 
len ratingtwo Won t even let me upload a single video 
len ratingtwo I ve even tried smaller ones in case the file was too big 
len ratingtwo Nope 
len ratingtwo Thanks Google 
len ratingfour If you poop on it a little it helps get the app started 
len ratingfive Drive is awesome so organized
len ratingfive Great app

len ratingone Been using this app since I got my first iPhone in 
len ratingone There hasn t been any problem until my recent upgrade to the new iPhone XS 
len ratingone I frequently use the app to view data from a Google Sheet file 
len ratingone I ve changed phones every year and had no issues 
len ratingone For some reason with this device the tabs on my Google Sheet file never worked and I can only view the first tab but not the rest 
len ratingone I ve lost count of how many times I ve uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingone After the reinstallation the tabs on the Google Sheet work but as soon as you close the file it stopped working 
len ratingone It would be great if you can please look into it 
len ratingone I rely on this app to be productive and I hope you guys can fix the code soon 
len ratingfive An app that is this functional was unimaginable 
len ratingfive The fact it can do everything you can do on your actual computer is mind blowing 
len ratingfive I love the fact i can type all my essays and organize everything perfectly on all on my phone 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingthree Would be ideal to be able to change the name of a file download when adding it to folder 
len ratingthree There is no way to do this and it takes a lot of searching to do this after the fact 
len ratingthree Also you have to go into a folder to create a folder within it 
len ratingthree There is no way to do it otherwise 
len ratingthree These may seem minor but are things I need do daily so having these features would be immeasurably helpful 
len ratingone Can t open every page
len ratingthree This app provides access to your google account storage space great 
len ratingthree It also puts a Location in your Files app where iCloud and local storage exist fantastic 
len ratingthree But you must understand that you pay for the free GB with your privacy 
len ratingthree Google makes money off of selling your data 
len ratingthree For me that is too high of a price to pay for the free cloud storage or the low price additional storage 
len ratingthree I went with Apple s iCloud which is completely private and encrypted 
len ratingthree you pay for iCloud s GB through having an Apple device and pay for the additional space if needed 
len ratingthree You don t pay by sacrificing your privacy with iCloud 
len ratingone Can t open my older files saved on Google Drive have I lost my old saved files 
len ratingone Also once it tells me I can t open it I can t find a way to back up or out
len ratingone Not sure what happened with an update or something but I am no longer able to download images off of my drive onto my iPhone or iPad which was the primary app that I had always used to do so 
len ratingone Not sure what needs to be fixed but please make it happen ASAP and I ll change my review 
len ratingone Pictures won t load
len ratingfive Recently switched my phone to the iPhone Plus from the regular 
len ratingfive Since the switch I can t tap hold saved images to download to my phone 
len ratingfive Some light digging lead me to finding the save option in the send a copy option 
len ratingfive This is the best app for school writing and more Bye
len ratingfive Like
len ratingone Something about some type of device policy which I cannot access 
len ratingfive my fav form of file share 
len ratingfive  The drive allows for school success 
len ratingfive It s so helpful with group projects 
len ratingfive  Extremely useful for Google Doc
len ratingfive You may wish to try this cool app
len ratingthree For some reasons after the lastest update i cant save photo
len ratingone I tried to save a video from google drive but it doesn t give me the option which makes me very upset and angry 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX IT SO WE CAN SAVE VIDEOS TO OUR CAMERA ROLL
len ratingfive Google drive is the best I am a student years old I love this give it five stars
len ratingone A friend of mine took a bunch of photos and shared the JPGs with me in a Google Drive folder 
len ratingone But I can t save the images to my photo roll on iOS 
len ratingfive Very good just sometimes confuseing
len ratingfive So helpful with schoolwork
len ratingone I get notifications that I can not get ride of 
len ratingone This is a BAD problem and very annoying 
len ratingfive It helps me with schoolwork documents 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive k
len ratingone Tried uploading my photos 
len ratingone Now I can not download them again 
len ratingone Don t waste your time 
len ratingone Awful app with no support whatsoever
len ratingfive Todo lo guardo con absoluta tranquilidad y seguridad 
len ratingfive F cil de usar y ver todo lo guardado en cualquier celular o lugar 
len ratingfive Lo recomiendo siempre a todos los amigos y familiares 
len ratingfive Muy buena 
len ratingfour This is a great app 
len ratingfour The reason for the stars is because I cannot download this same app on my Mac Pro 
len ratingfour Having the ability to open this app on all my devices would be a huge benefit 
len ratingfive Excelent app I m very happy to have it
len ratingfive No flaws 
len ratingfive Everything expected 
len ratingone Keeps sending notifications but nothing 
len ratingone Truly annoying 
len ratingone Going to uninstall it permanently 
len ratingone I love google drive 
len ratingone It s easy to get documents from my laptop to phone easily 
len ratingone But this update doesn t let me download my photos to my phone anymore 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It works for Android and iPhone and makes going from phone to phone so easy 
len ratingfive I love it a lot but please make it so that it can recognize ogg audio files and make the update for iOS update up to iOS 
len ratingfive So I just got a new IPhone and this app is awesome I have all my documents on all my devices including my computer and it s really easy to switch from device to device 
len ratingfive All in all I give it two thumbs up 
len ratingtwo I hate that the app will not let me preview a document before opening it in google slides or docs 
len ratingtwo Maybe I just want to see it first but nope not an option 
len ratingtwo then I have to close those apps and go back 
len ratingtwo then it changes the order my documents were in and I have to find them all over again 
len ratingtwo What is the point of the google drive app if everything just opens in a different app anyway 
len ratingone No one likes it
len ratingone Now I can t save photo to phone by long hold on image 
len ratingone  I m only use the app once because the site can t copy one simple link 
len ratingone Desktop mode We shouldn t need apps to do one simple task 
len ratingfive I love it everything in one place
len ratingone  Deleted my review again without fixing the bugs 
len ratingone The app constantly freezes up when I m trying to open a document often 
len ratingone So I m traveling and need my frequent flyer info 
len ratingone It s on the nd page of a doc on my drive and for the last month or so I can t access it of course right when I need it 
len ratingone Must be a glitch 
len ratingone But it s really unnerving 
len ratingfive Great for transferring files and distributing content for partnerships on the road 
len ratingone All of a sudden I can t save images by doing a long hold on the photo 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone Never mind the star only did it to get your attention 
len ratingone Overall the app is very useful and helpful however Is there a way that you can lock or set a passcode to a document 
len ratingone If there isn t I highly recommended 
len ratingone  Google Drive is a great app for storing apps in the cloud but there is one VERY BIG issue 
len ratingone The app has absolutely NO security options 
len ratingone There s no PIN Touch ID or Face ID options 
len ratingone All of which are offered by the other two biggest rivals Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive 
len ratingone I have requested security options using the feedback feature in Drive for years but it has fallen on deaf ears apparently 
len ratingone It truly amazes me that a company as large and capable as Google would even offer a service like Drive which can store potentially very sensitive information and not at least offer some type of security option 
len ratingone  Google Drive is a great app for storing apps in the cloud but there is one VERY BIG issue

len ratingone It truly amazes me that a company as large as Google would even have a service like Drive that doesn t offer some form of security options in the app itself right off the bat 
len ratingone Please help
len ratingfive Sometimes you gotta save files sometimes in a Cloud 
len ratingfive All the time Drive lets you do just that without issue 
len ratingfive Can t complain 
len ratingfive Great to use in my classroom 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Easy to use excellent search works on all devices 
len ratingfive Don t leave home without it 
len ratingtwo While I love google drive in general I don t like the app because in order to edit my documents or do anything besides just view things I have to download all of the separate apps that are a part of this 
len ratingtwo And so I have an entire folder of different apps because I need one for spreadsheets and one for documents and one for just the drive and it s just a ton of wasted space and memory just to be able to edit my items in my google drive 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone I have to select my pictures by in order for them to upload instead of by click and I don t want the same pictures to be loaded again 
len ratingfive I am trying to do an assignment from my school account sayin i am wrong 
len ratingfive Is gud
len ratingthree Since update I no longer can save photos or documents to my iPhone 
len ratingthree Previously was able to hold screen and save this is no longer possible 
len ratingone  For some reason every day google chrome and other google apps log me out of my account 
len ratingone Thus making me have to retype the username and password every time which is very annoying 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX 
len ratingone It such how you can t edit not unless you get the slides app
len ratingone I can no longer hold down on a photo and save it which makes google drive significantly less useful for me
len ratingtwo There s no way to download my photos from drive anymore 
len ratingtwo Using iPad 
len ratingfive Great way to save Art Work without keeping it 
len ratingfive Everything I need right where I need it 
len ratingtwo I can t easily save photos from the Drive app to my iPhone photos 
len ratingtwo I had the feature and now it no longer works
len ratingfive why you have cancel my favourite feature that press and hold the picture then i can save it directly to camera roll 
len ratingfive Im very impressed
len ratingfive  Awesome I can keep all my homework on here
len ratingone The adds are annoying
len ratingthree App works fine but don t bank on desktop and web to sync accessing docs is shaky at best
len ratingfour I appreciate that I may upload and take my files 
len ratingfour I prefer to be paperless 
len ratingone Please fix the pdf
len ratingfive I like it so easy to use it in all my devices and has big free storage u can use many apps with it
len ratingone Saving directly to your photos app no longer works 
len ratingone Moving to Dropbox 
len ratingone What is going on 
len ratingone Why haven t you guys fix this problem 
len ratingone No longer can I hold onto an image for a quick option to save the photo 
len ratingfive Privacy is for criminals
len ratingfive What ohh it good it s a great app
len ratingfive Est chido el app
len ratingfive It is the best 
len ratingfive It s an amazing things migang 
len ratingfive Goof
len ratingone I hold my finger down and nothing pops anymore 
len ratingone Can t download my photos 
len ratingfour Some of the videos aren t working
len ratingtwo I need to access my school work on here from home but when I put in my passwords and stuff it won t let me in and I m unable to do my homework 
len ratingone I make it a point to not install google apps for privacy 
len ratingone I wanted to delete items from my google drive on safari but there is no option to do so 
len ratingone Looking further on a help page items can only be deleted on the app 
len ratingone This is just terrible 
len ratingone The fact that they force me to download their app to be able to perform a basic function is appalling 
len ratingone I can t believe that tactics such as this exist for companies to get more people to download their apps 
len ratingone Not to mention the incessant pop ups telling me to download each app when I use the websites on my devices too 
len ratingone Sheets Docs Slides Gmail Drive just put everything together for crying out loud 
len ratingone Waste of space on my phone 
len ratingone As soon as I finish deleting my stuff this app is uninstalled 
len ratingone Unbelievable 
len ratingfive UPDATE latest app update fixed the problem i was having 
len ratingfive Now this app is great again 
len ratingfive ORIGINAL COMMENT On sheets with multiple tabs the Drive app only lets me view the first tab 
len ratingfive Clicking other tabs doesn t change the view 
len ratingfive I am using an iPhone 
len ratingfive I had to make a Video presentation and this helped me move the file from my iPad to my phone thank you for this app
len ratingfour Just started using it 
len ratingfour Will update soon
len ratingone Want to send files without google knowing who gets the file forget that
len ratingone  Waste of bandwidth with updates wow 
len ratingone How fat do you need to make your apps
len ratingfive As a teacher it is a very valuable resource for my students and it allows them to save their work easily 
len ratingone I ve been paying for Google Drive for quit a while and they ve always had a screen hold button to save a photo 
len ratingone Now that screen hold button is gone and don t know how to save the actual photo I made to share with friends and family 
len ratingone How do we save the photo without screen shooting it 
len ratingone I don t want to keep cropping the sides away on every single photo 
len ratingthree Kinda really disappointed the option to download images directly to your camera roll has been removed it was one of my favorite features 
len ratingtwo My app used work very well but not sure lately it has been crashing quite often 
len ratingfive Apple Cloud doesn t allow off phone iPad storage but Google Drive does so that you can free up your onboard memory still have access to your vids pics I love it so the Drive App is on all my Apple products
len ratingtwo Can t open zip files
len ratingfive This app helps us do class work and what else we need to be done with 
len ratingthree It is not really good app but you can use google docs app because it is very good
len ratingfive Great functionality
len ratingfive Google Drive I will get hired right away especially as a production assistant in a movie set 
len ratingfive Thank you Google Drive and Craigslist

len ratingone I just don t like it
len ratingfour  The app it self works great but it s missing one big thing 
len ratingfour Security 
len ratingfour As far as I can tell there are no security options 
len ratingfour I don t really understand why there isn t an option to use a PIN or Face ID for an app that can potentially have very sensitive information 
len ratingfour Especially from a company like Google 
len ratingfive Drive est top j adore
len ratingtwo Help 
len ratingtwo I used to love this feature and sad it doesn t seem to be working 
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingtwo This was the primary use of the Google Drive app for me wirelessly transferring edited photography to my device 
len ratingfive Love saving and storing my photos here better than iCloud 
len ratingfive And I have an iPhone 
len ratingfive I ve had Samsung as well but prefer iPhone 
len ratingfive But I prefer this to iCloud 
len ratingone On the XS you cant use D touch to download the pictures 
len ratingone Yes your own pictures 
len ratingone You can on any other device even on the iPhone and android devices 
len ratingone I don t get why they have to make this so difficult 
len ratingone Don t try to press the app support button because the link is broken 
len ratingthree Can t save to camera roll now 
len ratingthree Tapping and holding on the photo doesn t bring up the menu anymore 
len ratingthree Apple s newest update bricked many apps 
len ratingthree Many regrets 
len ratingfive I don t really have much to say about it but I can say this app is so good 
len ratingfive Google is THE BEST I recommend getting this app 
len ratingfive Also It is perfect of saving all your google docs 
len ratingfive This app is technically google docs anyway 
len ratingfive But it s for you iPad or phone 
len ratingfive I am using this app on an iPad so I don t really know what is is like on a phone but when I try it I will tell you guys about it 
len ratingfive And again YOU SHOULD GET THIS APP 
len ratingfive XD
len ratingone Fix this 
len ratingone  On sheets with multiple tabs the Drive app only lets me view the first tab 
len ratingone Clicking other tabs doesn t change the view 
len ratingone I am using an iPhone 
len ratingfive Good but photos only load by s 
len ratingfive You will need to back out and scroll to the next s block 
len ratingfive A little bit unintuitive 
len ratingone I can not save two my library y 
len ratingfive I m an upcoming artist and I love it for working with ppl
len ratingone  Huge battery drain on iphone when reading pdf battery drains so fast 
len ratingthree The new update on my iPhone isn t allowing me to save photos from my drive to my camera roll
len ratingfive Makes finding documents on my phone so much easier 
len ratingthree The app works alright but you can t save video to Photo Library and with the most recent update I can t save photos directly either 
len ratingthree I now have to email photos to myself to get them on my device which is super inconvenient 
len ratingthree I ve also tried using the Open in option to avoid this and although it appeared to work I was opening in Instagram it didn t actually work 
len ratingthree Useful and convenient application 
len ratingthree Need a quicker way to find a document and attach it to an email
len ratingone As an artist sharing drafts and images are key in communication between other editors thought it s impossible to save the images without a save function anymore 
len ratingone I used to have the ability to save pictures on my iPhone from albums I would upload 
len ratingone Can t do that anymore since the last update 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone I need it to work 
len ratingfive Austin
len ratingfive Life has become so much simpler for me with my all my docs easily accessible though all my devices 
len ratingfive I cannot imagine being productive without it 
len ratingtwo I used to be able to pinch and zoom on a document now it just keeps reverting back to the original size 
len ratingtwo This is unbelievably annoying also the fact that there s no find or search function 
len ratingtwo This makes it very hard to find a certain page or chapter when looking through documents with multiple pages 
len ratingtwo I almost don t want to use this anymore 
len ratingone Save function broken 
len ratingone I m a photographer this app is useless if I can t access my work on the go 
len ratingone I have the TB plan 
len ratingone Please fix the issue or I will be going to Dropbox 
len ratingthree Slide decks take forever to load
len ratingone I have always uploaded photos from from my desktop to GD to then save to my phone but now you can t do that and I really don t understand why 
len ratingone Please change this Google 
len ratingone  Save function broken 
len ratingone I m a photographer this app is useless if I can t access my work on the go 
len ratingone I have the TB plan 
len ratingone Please fix the issue or I will be going to Dropbox 
len ratingthree Directions could be little friendly for people my age 
len ratingthree I have to guess a lot re read much for understanding 
len ratingthree Immunity savvy at age and taught mostly by my children when they were home still 
len ratingthree Now on my own 
len ratingone As an artist who uses an iPad Pro for all my social media it was really useful to be able to access one of my images with this app and simply hold my finger on it to save to my iPad 
len ratingone That function no longer seems to be there so until that s corrected I ll be moving all my files over to DropBox 
len ratingfive Good app 
len ratingfive I really love google services
len ratingfive  My school uses this a lot and we sometimes have things we need to do with google drive at home so I got it and it s amazing 
len ratingfive Thx for the app
len ratingtwo There seems to be no way to save my own files in the latest version kinda makes me want to switch to a different service 
len ratingtwo Also there is still no option to clear the cache I have to frequently delete and redownload the app because it will take up gigs 
len ratingfour I am enjoying google drive 
len ratingfour I use it for school and it is very helpful 
len ratingfour A few complexities which are hard to figure out 
len ratingfour Like where are notifications 
len ratingfour Overall though it is great 
len ratingfour  stars

len ratingfive So useful and simple app thank you google
len ratingtwo Please bring back the feature that allows us to download from our files directly to our mobile device library 
len ratingtwo I am very appreciative of this application when it allows me to download the pictures and files I upload from my laptop without that the app is useless 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingone  I don t know why but holding onto a image and saving it doesn t work anymore 
len ratingone It s a drag that I have to do steps just to have an image 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingfour I really drive my work and my words just need a program to control and edit PDF files it will be five stars without competition 
len ratingfive  Really easy to use
len ratingfive When sick easy to be able to use at home 
len ratingfive Have on pc at school too 
len ratingfive This is a good APP 
len ratingone Used to be that you long pressed on a photo and it will download 
len ratingone That is no longer the case 
len ratingone What the hell 
len ratingone Doesn t work on browser either 
len ratingone It s been draining of my battery with min foreground and mins background 
len ratingfive I must say that google makes my office life so much better from docs to sheets from photos to drive I have to say that google keepers my modern day company Moving forward and I touch 
len ratingfive Google you are Amazing 
len ratingone I have been using google drive for a long time without any issues but I had to stop because I cannot watch the videos anymore 
len ratingone I went online and I read that some people are having the same problem 
len ratingone The videos don t open and show still processing but it never opens 
len ratingone This used to be my favorite app until a recent update where I can no longer download my photos I upload to my google drive 
len ratingone Makes this app useless 
len ratingfour Review 
len ratingone Unable to save photos to camera roll anymore 
len ratingone This is happening on two different iPhones 
len ratingone This is after allowing permission 
len ratingone Why remove that super practical feature 
len ratingone Will change rating after that 
len ratingfive Since I do most of my viewing using my iPad Google Drive is an excellent place to store the things that I want to keep 
len ratingfive I can then download them or upload them to my personal computer and I know they are safe always
len ratingfive Easy to navigate and quick respond 
len ratingfour I can t press and hold to save photos to my phone anymore 
len ratingfour I have to import to another app first which is so tedious 
len ratingfive Gay
len ratingfour Good drive
len ratingone It s not working 
len ratingtwo I ve been using Drive and Dropbox simultaneously for a while now 
len ratingtwo One of the biggest and very critical reasons I don t use Drive much is due to the fact that the image downloads to a mobile device are terribly compressed 
len ratingtwo I conducted a number of tests over multiple devices between both Dropbox and Drive with the exact same files and every single time I landed the same results 
len ratingtwo The image downloaded to a mobile device no difference on desktop or laptop reflected a drastically reduced quality when uploaded and downloaded from Drive vs Dropbox 
len ratingtwo Regardless of how the image was selected for download via Drive I always had the same outcome a disappointingly low quality download of what was otherwise a very crisp and hi res professional quality capture 
len ratingtwo I m very surprised that this hasn t been brought up more and addressed but it seems most people aren t noticing how terribly compressed the images are and how badly it is impacting the quality 
len ratingthree Great for saving and sharing photos but pretty glitchy and hard to figure out how to download photos when uploaded from a computer and trying to save them to your phone 
len ratingone  I use Drive to download wallpapers from a shared album 
len ratingone And Google removed the long term function that allowed me to save photos to my Camera Roll 
len ratingone The app is now completely useless to me 
len ratingone Bring back the download button 
len ratingfive I am loving Google drive because it saves all my files and most of the other reasons that other users of that have mentioned in reviews I read over my only suggestion is says I m using it for practice tracks with my choir to practice songs what say I want to delete certain files that I m finished with and don t need to use anymore it s took me forever to delete all these MP files I don t know if it was the app or above within the app but that s only one minor thing that might need to be looked at other than that your app is great
len ratingfive My class in rd grade said to share stuff with the app so we used a website becuase spaceing for teacher files and its perfecto
len ratingfive I can keep slides and other docs all in one place without losing it
len ratingfive Great for my Business class and English class
len ratingfive It works 
len ratingfive What more do you need to know 
len ratingfive Hhjj
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive I love my google drive 
len ratingone Trying to open a shared album 
len ratingone But it invariably crashes after browsing through images 
len ratingfive Cuntry iroaad stakenme home to the place wher i belong wets verigigna mountian mama take me heom country roads
len ratingone  It s not working
len ratingone I use google drive to save photos directly on my iPhone 
len ratingone Now that feature is gone 
len ratingone I used to hold the photo down to pop open the option to download the photo 
len ratingone What the heck 
len ratingone Why take that away 
len ratingone Not showing WhatsApp chat history
len ratingone I am always shocked google has a following at all 
len ratingone The drive app is Mossing the key ability to download the images back from the drive 
len ratingone The has a plethora of things but a simple save to the device is missing 
len ratingone Used to be able to click the image and a simple save to photo roll was available but now gone 
len ratingone Odd that even when that used to work it was never on the menu 
len ratingone These fools at google think everything needs to be in the cloud and stay there and share from there 
len ratingone They are a very narcissistic company 
len ratingthree The app won t let me download a video
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Now leave me alone 
len ratingfive I has been using it last few year 
len ratingfive It s a very useful memory that I can access everywhere on any device 
len ratingfive Now I have no fear to lose my data 
len ratingfive I love us and all until you yuuuuuuuuujuuuuhuuuuuuuuuuhuhuuuuuuyuyuuuuyuyjyjhyu
len ratingfive excelente aplicaci n y muy til
len ratingfive Me gusta google drive 
len ratingfive Es r pido pr ctico y sensacional 
len ratingfive Ya tengo unos a os con el y me siento c modo 
len ratingfive Cada vez que lleno una aplicaci n y me piden el resume ah esta listo google drive con la informaci n 
len ratingfive Gracias google drive por ser un buen compa ero un amigo y un hermano para mi 
len ratingfive Much simas gracias 
len ratingfive Alexis Matos L pez El Mendigo de la poes a y la canci n ante los ojos de Dios 
len ratingone Since the new update I haven t been able to save photos to my phone from drive 
len ratingone It s the main reason why I use the app 
len ratingfive I love everything about this app and make sure it saves everything and it helps if you lose your phone and you can reupload everything
len ratingfive This app is the goat that s it
len ratingfive Great for anything
len ratingone You can no longer tap and hold a photo to save it to your camera roll 
len ratingone You have to tap then go to send a copy and then tap save to camera roll 
len ratingone Why add a useless amount of steps unless they are trying to force us to constantly see the other menu options 
len ratingone Also photo resolution when save now tops out at x 
len ratingone You need to use safari and save photos from there if you want full resolution 
len ratingtwo Can t do upload all for photos from iPhone can t download multiple photos from the drive to iPhone 
len ratingtwo It simply is not usable for moving more than three photos 
len ratingtwo I go through viewing roughly pictures and the app crashes hard 
len ratingtwo Probably running out of memory or something 
len ratingtwo Happens every time
len ratingone One of if not the most important features on this app is the ability to save images by holding down on the image and download it 
len ratingone Well now that feature is simply gone 
len ratingone How do you save images now 
len ratingone I have no clue 
len ratingfive It s simple to use and makes my digital life so much easier and organized 
len ratingfive I have access to my files wherever I go providing there is internet and access to a computer 
len ratingfive I love the platform 
len ratingfive I use Google Classroom at school 
len ratingfive Say goodbye to paper and killing trees 
len ratingone Drive used to allow users to save to pictures to camera roll with a long press 
len ratingone Google broke this with the latest release 
len ratingfour Love the app have been using for a long time for reading documents across several devices 
len ratingfour In the older versions after I zoomed in for larger fonts the app did not automatically resize to default size when I move from page to page which is very convenient as I could keep the same size for reading 
len ratingfour However in the most recent versions the app keeps resizing back to default as I move from one zoomed page to another 
len ratingfour I have to zoom in or resize for bigger fonts again and again 
len ratingfour I hope google will take this into account in the next update 
len ratingfive Google is God s gift to humanity 
len ratingthree Easy for me to use and seems to do what I need it too 
len ratingthree Only gave three cause I haven t really loaded it up with huge amounts or used it to it s full lengths yet 
len ratingtwo Since the last update I am not able to view other sheets in a workbook 
len ratingtwo I tap the tab but stay on the top sheet 
len ratingtwo Any other tab does NOT WORK 
len ratingtwo Please fix it 
len ratingtwo Yes I restarted my phone and that didn t fix the issue 
len ratingfive I am honestly SO HAPPY and GRATEFUL that I have Google Docs and Drive 
len ratingfive Google Drive has SAVED ME so many times when I was in a rush to get something done 
len ratingfive Recently my device is all I ve had to finish my work on my Google Account so I am SO GLAD I have this helpful app 
len ratingfive I like how you can access everything really easily 
len ratingfive From creating a new document to deleting documents 
len ratingfive Everything is SO EASY to do 
len ratingfive You don t have to even ask for help because it s pretty self explanatory even if there are no directions 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT 
len ratingfive If there are two sites I d send holiday cards to it would be google drive and tinyurl com
len ratingtwo  For example apps that use a file view like Pretext or Pages throw an error when trying to create a new blank document to work on if it s on Drive 
len ratingtwo Dropbox handles this perfectly 
len ratingfour I really like this app it s great for extra storage but would love if it was easier to upload and if it syncs automatically to iPhone
len ratingfive This works so well and I absolutely love it
len ratingone Have a gdoc titled flashlights and search flash does not find it 
len ratingone This is just one example 
len ratingone Drive would be a star product but searching is so fundamental it brings the whole app down 
len ratingone Also google is a search company 
len ratingone How is this even possible 
len ratingfive I have always liked photography and when I first got my first camera I wondered How do I get these photos to my iPad It took about a year to figure out I could use Google Drive but I don t regret it and I never will 
len ratingfive Wonderful
len ratingthree I use both Windows and Mac system and I often has issue with transferring files between system 
len ratingthree And Drive used to be the bridge between the two 
len ratingthree I ve always been able to download pictures I upload to Drive to my phone 
len ratingthree But that has changed lately 
len ratingthree And that s a huge bummer 
len ratingthree Not sure why I still need this app on my phone for 
len ratingone With the new update I can no longer save photos 
len ratingone Why not just add a download option from the rest of the options 
len ratingthree Really wish music files would continue to play thru the playlist instead of having to go to the next song manually 
len ratingthree Other than that I love it
len ratingone Useless if I and others cannot save photos from app
len ratingfive Guardo mis documentos en Drive y accedo desde cualquier dispositivo 
len ratingfive Muy til me gusta 
len ratingfive it s great
len ratingone This last update took away my most used feature as a photographer that is constantly updating social media on the go for my business 
len ratingone WHY CAN WE NO LONGER SAVE AN IMAGE TO OUR PHONE GALLERY JUST BY HOLDING DOWN THE IMAGE 
len ratingone Now I have to go to the menu and hit save a copy and download this is a ridiculous waste of time 
len ratingone Please bring it back 
len ratingone I even pay for extra space because of the ease of use for Drive between my devices 
len ratingfour  Ever since the new update I can t save pictures from my drive to my iPad to upload to social media
len ratingfive I can finally be as organized as I ve always wanted but couldn t do it on my own now I can thank you
len ratingone If you cannot provide a quick opening saving and attaching property to this stupid software you just earned another hater
len ratingfour Works well 
len ratingfour I like that I don t have to use up space on my phone to save the pictures 
len ratingfour Although I wish it was easier to save images in a specific folder 
len ratingfour But over all a good app 
len ratingone Super super handy to have between devices but as a visual artist who stores tons of files getting them out of the drive into a mobile device is a freaking hassle 
len ratingone Currently on my iPhone I am completely unable to save my photos to my phone normally it s press but after restarting reinstalling and turning off my D Touch I m still totally unable to get photos from drive to my cell 
len ratingone It s also not working on my iPad Pro 
len ratingone This is a hugely important piece of my work flow as I use my cell to manage my social media 
len ratingone Honestly just put a download button into the freaking menu 
len ratingone Having a storage space between devices is cool but it s totally freaking useless if I can t actually retrieve anything 
len ratingone Til this major issue is fixed bad review 
len ratingthree I m disappointed with Google 
len ratingthree I m locked out of my Email that I ve had for many years and had to create a new one with Yahoo 
len ratingthree I have had no luck getting help with this problem 
len ratingthree I can t get into my Pinterest account because it is linked with my old Email 
len ratingthree This is true for many things 
len ratingthree It would help if I could get a real person to help me get back into my old account 
len ratingone Latest update removed the ability to save photos to your phone 
len ratingone Is this some sort of joke 
len ratingone Like how could someone miss this issue or why on earth would this be intentional 
len ratingone Backups are now worthless 
len ratingfive It s extremely user friendly it s simple and works on all devices 
len ratingfive You can store everything in one place documents pdfs videos pictures presentations and even spreadsheets 
len ratingfive I use it for everything 
len ratingtwo How am I supposed to save the photos to my phone 
len ratingtwo This is a disaster for me 
len ratingtwo I think you guys removed the save to camera roll feature when you press and hold on photos saved in google drive 
len ratingtwo As a photographer this was a vital part of my work flow 
len ratingtwo I would save files from my pc to my drive then just open on my iPhone and save them to camera roll to post to social media 
len ratingtwo By removing this feature it s not a pain to get photos into my camera roll 
len ratingtwo Why did you guys remove this feature and if it was just an oversight could it be returned 
len ratingone I use this app to send out my photography pictures but now I can t save them 
len ratingone Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingone I ve also invested in this app and it s my main source to send pictures to clients 
len ratingfive Helpful to access everything
len ratingfive Not sure yet 
len ratingfive I haven t used it that much but so far so good 
len ratingtwo Estar a bueno que agreguen una funci n en la que se pueda resaltar el texto en los documentos PDF Uso mayormente Drive ara estudiar y hacer res menes pero sin esa herramienta me es m s dif cil 
len ratingone Ever since the new update I cannot save photos anymore 
len ratingone Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingone After the newest update I can no longer see any way to save a photo to my phone other than a screenshot which looses quality
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone Can t save pictures since the update 
len ratingfour I recently updated my app and suddenly I can t download pictures or any files to my iPad
len ratingfour Greatful
len ratingthree So what happened to long pressing an image to save it to the Camera Roll 
len ratingthree This function is no longer available or what 
len ratingthree It was great up until that very fluid and easy for me to manage and send multiple photography proofs 
len ratingthree Now they can t be saved onto the phone itself 
len ratingthree What gives 
len ratingthree I can t save any photos since this recent update 
len ratingthree Fix it NOW 
len ratingthree Or I will give it STAR 
len ratingone Too slow
len ratingthree I can t seem to tap and hold and have the save or Dow load option pop up anymore 
len ratingthree Just happening today 
len ratingthree It was fine the other day 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a great application for storing and accessing documents and files from anywhere 
len ratingthree Ever since most recent update I can t download ANY files or photos 
len ratingthree I know it s the update because I downloaded a photo then updated and now I can t anymore 
len ratingtwo Why can I no longer press lightly and hold to save images to my phone 
len ratingtwo What s going on 
len ratingtwo Biggest reason I use to app to get images onto my phone from drive 
len ratingfive Used to be great but now I can t save photos to my phone 
len ratingfive That kinda ruins it
len ratingone Why can t I save an image from my Drive to the ios photos app anymore 
len ratingone I used to be able to touch the image and get a menu option to save image 
len ratingone I HATE THAT YOU DON T BOTHER TO TELL US WHAT CHANGED WITH EACH RELEASE 
len ratingfive  Cool
len ratingfive Good stuff
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone  Hey google 
len ratingone We are expecting for this app like before with passcode protection 
len ratingone Because now it s doesn t have any protection 
len ratingone So on your next update please fix the problems 
len ratingone Thank you Best regards Google Fan 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Makes communicating with my Google Drive easy as pie which is a big thing for me cause I do so all the time 
len ratingfive I ve written veritable novels of poetry all neatly arranged into folders and subjects 
len ratingfive I share documents store files online anything you really need from a personal content manager really 
len ratingone Videos take forever to process I have been waiting minutes do it to upload and process 
len ratingone I have work due at 
len ratingone I have been doing this for a good minutes 
len ratingone I really like everything about google but this is a no good 
len ratingfive I like this app be cause I accidentally deleted my animation and I saved it to this app and it was saved
len ratingone Every update mucks up the way I had things arranged and has lost irreplaceable things 
len ratingone Just once I wish gobble llc spelled incorrectly on purpose would actually respond to negative reviews 
len ratingfive Write this It s a good app but it s boring 
len ratingfive Gets the job done 
len ratingfive Google never fails 
len ratingfour  I can t type emojis in docs or sheets from my phone but on my computer it works fine 
len ratingfour There are some random ones that I can type but it s usually ones I don t use 
len ratingfour For some reason it works perfectly with google sheets Please let me use emojis from the iOS apps 
len ratingone I don t want to rate it but I ve been forced to 
len ratingone My keyboard blocked the Cancel button 
len ratingfive I love google drive but when I am on my iPad I cannot get my mail 
len ratingfive Am I not doing something right 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive  With all of the cloud apps today I still feel google drive is the best 
len ratingfive I highly recommend google drive 
len ratingfive The convenience and security online puts it at the top of my list 
len ratingfive  Makes organizing and creating different documents much easier to use 
len ratingfive Google does it again with this app score 
len ratingfive Nani why do i need this
len ratingfive I love how organized you can get with this app 
len ratingfive I use it for school and it really helps me 
len ratingfive Easy and handy to use 
len ratingfive Whenever you need the data it s easily available on your phone 
len ratingfive No need need for a usb thumb drive to carry 
len ratingone I tried sending a group of photos from a family reunion 
len ratingone They have to get permission for every single photo to see 
len ratingone This is ridiculous 
len ratingfour It s difficult for me to navigate smart phone novice it s hard to navigate 
len ratingfour Takes a lot of effort
len ratingfive Always there when I need it most 
len ratingfive It is great to have 
len ratingtwo hey bro sorry i was the day you were gonna i was a good day i was a good night i was the day you were gonna i was a good day i was a good night i was the day you were gonna i was a good day i was a good night i was the day you were gonna 
len ratingthree  Files can t be edited from Drive itself 
len ratingthree  Google Docs Sheets and Slides need iOS and Drive doesn t 
len ratingthree This is rather inconvenient especially for us with devices that can t update to iOS 
len ratingfive This app is so helpful
len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingfive Drive helps me organize and store my files in one location 
len ratingfive I am able to retrieve my information across my devices quickly with ease and confidence in Google s secure platform 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingone I can t Download
len ratingfive It takes all my files and has it organized in a way for me to just find click and boom it s there 
len ratingfive  yep 
len ratingfive Make everything easy to access and share very convenient and easy to use and organize your documents 
len ratingone Whenever I tried to download from iCloud dumb old google drive would try to steal the stupid file 
len ratingone Don t use 
len ratingone complete failure 
len ratingone Takes to long to upload and most fail
len ratingfive Very nice app
len ratingone Over photos stored in drive they are now ALL MISSING 
len ratingone Since when does THAT make Goigle Drive anything but a COMPLETE UTTER FAILURE 
len ratingfive I like this app so much you don t no at all
len ratingfive Not a fan of Tim Cook but this is really convenient for bigger files that you transfer over onto your phone from your laptop
len ratingone Theo nh t i th y google drive kh ti n d ng nh ng t i mu n n ph i hi n i h n m t ch t l i m t i th ch nh t C i th hai l google drive m kh ng c n wifi l m i ng i m i l c m i n i kh ng c wifi th c ng s d ng c

len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive  I love google drive it is a very safe place for files 
len ratingfive I like it because it is good 
len ratingfive I almsost pooped my pants on how bad this app is
len ratingfive This will sound snobbish but drive makes it easy to move files from my computer to my tablet and is a lot simpler then anything I ve found in iOS 
len ratingfive Plus sharing is a breeze and the Google assistant air does great work 
len ratingfive Google Drive is awesome I love it
len ratingfive This is a very good multi platform application which I use for all of my school work 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive This is so helpful for school and everyone 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone Why is it asking me for payment info 
len ratingfive This app is amazing 
len ratingfive It can access your google account while on your iOS device 
len ratingfive It can also access your google docs slides sheets script and more 
len ratingfour I can t open the audio files to listen mp mp 
len ratingfour Please fix 
len ratingfive Please upgrade my account
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Wow
len ratingthree Still a clunky system 
len ratingfour I m a Mac user normally but I used Drive today for the first time to upload a couple hundred photos to share with a client 
len ratingfour I didn t find it very user friendly that is it didn t seem self explanatory really 
len ratingfour I looked around for a while to find out how exactly to create a folder move files to the folder and then share it with the client 
len ratingfour However I looked up the instructions and then I was like Oh duh ok Now that I know how to use it it will be much easier and eventually become second nature just like anything else I use 
len ratingfour It s just the initial use that frustrated me 
len ratingfour Nothing is obvious or in your face which is very useful when using for the first time 
len ratingfour But I have no qualms with the app really 
len ratingfour Once I figured out how to use it it worked great 
len ratingfive I have been using this app a long time it helps a lot I love it
len ratingone So stupid 
len ratingone It isn t useful at all 
len ratingone You can t amend documents whatsoever 
len ratingfour Un po incasinato
len ratingfive Thank god for this app 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Use it everyday 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfour I ve been using it for more than a year now and it is very easy to navigate through 
len ratingfour Easy connection to my other devices 
len ratingfive No flaws
len ratingfive Great except for the recent force closing
len ratingone I remember being able to quickly edit recent files in the drive app now all of a sudden I can t do much anymore what happened serious question 
len ratingfive Very helpful 
len ratingfive I m writing this review to thank Google 
len ratingfive A few years back I was syncing my new MacBook and somehow ended up erasing ALL my pictures 
len ratingfive I was so distraught and it took me sometime to finally accept it 
len ratingfive So yesterday I m on Google Drive on one of my gmail accounts when I have the idea to just check my Trash of course it has been over three years and I m not getting any of my hopes up 
len ratingfive WELL 
len ratingfive Omg I see that in the trash are ALL my pics that were deleted 
len ratingfive I was beyond ecstatic like finding lost treasure or something 
len ratingfive Not to be totally dramatic but losing ALL your memories is a bit of a tiny trauma 
len ratingfive It has happened twice before both times due to using Apple products 
len ratingfive The first time was due to that iCloud fiasco few years back where we all thought syncing meant that Apple was backing up all our stuff to the cloud but that wasn t it at all 
len ratingfive So bam lost a TON of pics from the two best summers of my life 
len ratingfive And then when I bought a new MacBook I was trying to sync my photos to Google not trusting the Apple ICloud anymore and again I erase literally ten fifteen years worth of pics 
len ratingfive So anyway when I found these pics it was like getting back all these great memories and I can t thank Google Drive enough 
len ratingfive I mean most Trash just saves things for days max but i just cannot believe my luck and the fact that somehow I was backing up my stuff to Google Drive and not just Google Photos 
len ratingfive It s the best app guys iTS LITERALLY THE BEST app to back up photos 
len ratingfive Google rocks 
len ratingfive I m just speechless
len ratingfour Sup Google Thank for all of the options with google drive 
len ratingfour You have made me more efficient in my career and family life 
len ratingfour Have a great day 
len ratingfour Sincerely Tim
len ratingfive Awesome app
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfour With each update I m liking Drive more Han my Dropbox 
len ratingfour Still using the latter for redundant backup 
len ratingfive  Great job 
len ratingfive Thank you for all the hard work 
len ratingfive I am so enjoying google drive and classroom 
len ratingfive It s been a great addition to my classroom 
len ratingone Cannot zoom in on PDF files 
len ratingone Viewer resets to default zoom 
len ratingone Very annoying results in having to use outside PDF viewer 
len ratingone iPhone iOS 
len ratingone It is very unreliable and everything deletes
len ratingfive love it 
len ratingfive i get to work on my school work without a desktop 
len ratingfive i can also upload pictures and use them on a pc
len ratingthree But can t see enough data to work a sheet from a handheld device not their fault for that 
len ratingthree Only stars because it crashes often 
len ratingfive I like the ability to save offline copy
len ratingfive Use it for work and home to store almost everything 
len ratingfive Very user friendly
len ratingfive This app is a must have for everyone with many different features that can help anyone with their organization and storage 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfour I think it is grness
len ratingfive  Google photo makes it easy to retrieve menories 
len ratingfive Im a school going kid and this makes doing projects way easier
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive Works great for me 
len ratingfive Awesome tool
len ratingfive I ve been using this app for years 
len ratingfive It s reliable and easy to use 
len ratingone ios iphone click on a sheet to open and it opens another sheet 
len ratingone can t click on a field to edit 
len ratingone videos media don t play over airplay 
len ratingfive Tanks for the first
len ratingfive I m happy that I get more than enough space to store my iPhone files so I can kill iCloud off of 
len ratingfive Me
len ratingfour We use Drive for our file storage for my small business 
len ratingfive Best storage app ever especially for me because I m constantly switching phones
len ratingone  very interesting that my very detailed review has been deleted from here it s been two years with multiple updates 
len ratingone Among many other issues that I m not going to retype google Drive app needs to increase add the ability to upload MORE than pictures when you re in iOS photos and choose send to and then choose drive as the destination 
len ratingone The selection mechanism when uploading photos within the Drive app is abysmal thus allow us to leverage the quick selection and better interface of the built in iOS photos app to upload picts to Drive and more than photos at a time which is ridiculous 
len ratingone also please add detailed version update change logs simply saying bugs fixed or improvements made is not sufficient when determining whether to update or not 
len ratingtwo I was there was away to lock the app
len ratingone There is a long loading message that never goes away so I cannot download videos I have uploaded from a different device
len ratingone They don t tell you when you sign up that it will take the length of contract to upload your data 
len ratingone And they will not refund your payment when you discover that uploads are brutal take up all your bandwidth and bring your network to a crawl 
len ratingfive Great way to save all photos 
len ratingfour For fun interest and or information this is the place 
len ratingone I can t figure out how to manipulate and control this app
len ratingone It is taking too long for a uploaded file on my phone to be recognized as a file on my computer 
len ratingfive Es una aplicaci n muy til para guardar y movilizar archivos grandes
len ratingfive Google Drive has simplified the whole process of storing and sending music scores in PDF for me and I am deeply thnakful for this 
len ratingfive Ejejjdjqgdhdkfksgwhekjdjeh hkakdehkosjdhbrjdi Heidijeifhejditj ne jnrken it rifjwas nfjfnjfi
len ratingfive I can t work without it it s the most useful app ever 
len ratingfive I ve been using google drive for years 
len ratingfive I LOVE it 
len ratingfive All my docs online and a saved automatically 
len ratingfive I can access it and edit it from my computer my phone or my tablet

len ratingone When I try to open it is taking me to safari when I enter username and password at safari again it is showing me help page that is weird
len ratingfive I like google drive is because the things you can do is almost endless 
len ratingfour Good program easy to use mostly intuitive 
len ratingfive It s a great app and it keeps me and my work organized
len ratingfive  I absolutely love this app but it s missing the new Siri Shortcuts with iOS 
len ratingfive Can you please add support for the new Siri Shortcuts with the next update 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree I ve used google drive for personal data storage of all kinds for a long time 
len ratingthree However trying to locate files such as previously completed coursework papers assignments etc 
len ratingthree greater than years old isn t working 
len ratingthree I ve used the same account to backup my personal data however I can t locate them with ease 
len ratingthree It only shows recent files and gives no option to view access older ones 
len ratingthree This can be chaotic to say the least 
len ratingthree As a college student trying to graduate sooner rather than later I need absolute file organization and access to said files beyond that of recent suggested files 
len ratingthree I can t speak the desktop version but I have been using the app with its various tools docs slides etc 
len ratingthree  and have found some issues 
len ratingthree For instance I have to exit Docs and enter Drive to create a doc with in a specific location there should be a dropdown menu for choosing which folder on Drive I would like my new doc to be stored 
len ratingthree Also I shouldn t have to navigate to the main folder in Drive to share a folder that I am currently browsing 
len ratingthree Also I wish Google photos could automatically pull from a specific folder like favorites and not only the camera roll for automatic uploads 
len ratingthree As a photographer it makes more sense for me to cull through the images pick the best and upload those to my Drive I just wish I didn t have to manually select all the photos and could simply upload the folder all at once 
len ratingfive Great dope fresh clean play ball 
len ratingfive Swing batter batter swing 
len ratingfive All right great app cool dad 
len ratingone Stop spying on people stop funneling people data to the Government that s why IOS will always be better than android
len ratingfive This app is very useful
len ratingfive My photos and guns and Mario and Pok mon characters to wallop Bowser in shooting in Rio De Janerio Brazil from pistols to Miniguns etc 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingtwo Should be able to edit on app not need the docs or slides app
len ratingone I am so disgusted with the way how you guys treat your customers 
len ratingone Forcing us to download another app just to make edits is so lame and cheap 
len ratingone You guys care more about downloads then productivity 
len ratingone You guys should focus more on making customers happy and making the board happy 
len ratingtwo I can send between and fotos up to my gdrive and then the app just stalls processing any more 
len ratingtwo Sometimes it ll start an upload and then just crash 
len ratingtwo Really inconsistent performance and just stability 
len ratingtwo Always having to do a workaround to save videos 
len ratingtwo When watching a video there s a glitch where you can t exit out of it 
len ratingfive My life is literally better with drive 
len ratingfive All my stuff from any device 
len ratingfive Also love G Photos 
len ratingone Great app but there used to be a passcode lock I guess my question is WHY on earth would you remove that feature 
len ratingone That s like really important for security and privacy 
len ratingone Will expect to see it back in a NEAR future and add a Touch ID while you re at it you know the thing that ALL other PROPER cloud storage apps have 
len ratingfive I use this program to share files and schedule plans with my band 
len ratingfive It is quick easy and accessible everywhere 
len ratingfive It s a life saver 
len ratingfive This has helped me to organize my documents and papers 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfour Uploading something like images at once crashes on iOS I have to do batches of to be safe Also some other way to mass select and upload would be nice perhaps how iOS groups photos by day set so I can upload without clicking hundreds of times 
len ratingfour Been using Dropbox for years and lately OneDrive GDrive is faster and easier 
len ratingfour Would be perfect with a document scanner to ditch a couple apps 
len ratingfive  I E I Y IO 
len ratingfive  A breath of fresh air 
len ratingfive Student 
len ratingfive Professor 
len ratingfive Professional 
len ratingfive Personal 
len ratingfive A start up company 
len ratingfive A student organization 
len ratingfive I ve personally used Google Drive for all of the above barring professor 
len ratingfive It s so easy to keep organized with this app 
len ratingfive It doesn t matter if you have a little or a lot to store because the folders colors and importance stars help keep everything together 
len ratingfour My experience with drive has been nothing short of magnificent throughout my usage 
len ratingfour I have a plethora of memories in which I needed drive to perform to perfection and not only did drive deliver but did so in such a fashion that would make every app developer who worked on it proud and every app developer who didn t jealous 
len ratingfour The beginning of the issue stems from one unfaithful day in which drive decided that today was not a good day to perform the task I needed to 
len ratingfour Instead of uploading a video drive decided to act like it did and then not process the video leading to crushing negative repercussion in a deep emotional mental and physical level 
len ratingfour The sheer amount of disturbance my mind felt as I realize that the thing I trusted most in this world had failed me was excruciatingly painful 
len ratingfour However this should not take away from the overall performance which I believe to be almost not short of exemplary 
len ratingfive If you forget what your looking for Then Click the search Button and that search what Doc or anything that you are trying to look for
len ratingfive Our company is able to do so much more with Google Drive 
len ratingfive I m so glad that it saves docs automatically 
len ratingfive I m a part time photographer and I rely totally on Google Drive to share my photos with the models I work with 
len ratingfive It s private and secure and they can get full size photos that I ve taken 
len ratingfive This App works 
len ratingfive  I love google drive and use it on my iPad 
len ratingfive With the new iOS update it is now syncing well with the iCloud Drive and files stored in google drive cannot be edited from the ICloud files drive or written on using the Apple Pencil 
len ratingfive I hope we can fix this bug
len ratingfive GOOGLE DRIVE IS LOVELY 
len ratingfive thank you
len ratingone Pp
len ratingfive I do most of my cloud based documents with Drive and have done so for about years now 
len ratingfive At first I was hesitant but Google suite really is the worry free way to go 
len ratingfive The app is more unwieldy than the PC based version of Drive but I appreciate having access to all of my files on my mobile device 
len ratingfive Used daily to access documents across platforms iPad phone computer 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone My screen went black several times 
len ratingone Also when I went to complete document an Asian symbol was on my page 
len ratingfive Comes in very handy 
len ratingfive I will like to find out how I can have it show up on my PC 
len ratingfive Other then that it s great 
len ratingtwo Files stored are hard to manuvuer and slow access 
len ratingone Bad idea 
len ratingone A confusing redundancy that has forced me to resort to my Dropbox for clients that have trouble with how permissions in drive work 
len ratingone I hate it
len ratingone Oops typed it in the title 
len ratingfive Google Drive gives me access to important documents across the devices I regularly use whether desktop laptop iPad or iPhone 
len ratingfive Having such access is important to me since I no longer need to carry hard copies 
len ratingfive Nice and easy to work on 
len ratingfive Awesome angles and great moments 
len ratingfive Love the blue flower 
len ratingfive  I absolutely love this app but it s missing the new Siri Shortcuts with iOS 
len ratingfive Can you please add support for the new Siri Shortcuts with the next update 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone Viewing a pdf and keep losing connection on my iPhone
len ratingfive This is a good thing to have 
len ratingfive You can keep your work neat and organized
len ratingfive I like it
len ratingone after updating the latest version sheets are open scattered with no respects to sheet firmat worst update 
len ratingone urgently reupdate 
len ratingone I was trying the load a few folders of files to share with a friend but it turned the UI was so hard to use and my friend never got my files successfully 
len ratingone No wonder people use Dropbox because it is just plain easy without any tutorial 
len ratingone What is My Drive what is Computers and what is Google Drive folder on my laptop 
len ratingone Could there be a visual way to let users know what is in the cloud and what is not 
len ratingone Can never upload my resume when needed always freezes up my google chrome and have to close down program and start all over
len ratingfive This site is very helpful for those that that have busy lives 
len ratingfour  Having problems downloading sometimes
len ratingfive Absolutely best outdoor show 
len ratingthree While the app itself works normally for all intents and purposes when viewing PDF s something incredibly frustrating keeps occurring 
len ratingthree I would zoom in on the document move it just sharply enough for the menu bar to appear and the Zoom level immediately snaps back to 
len ratingthree Any time I accidentally tap while reading a document also snaps right back to zoom level 
len ratingthree It s so difficult to keep it from doing so 
len ratingthree I m running the latest update on my iPhone S 
len ratingfive It s the best app for school work to be organized and put in the right places so work won t be all over the place and you can make folders and name them so nothing won t get lost and it save automatically so no need to worry about work getting lost
len ratingfour T V 
len ratingfour T V gmt
len ratingone  Stupid
len ratingfive Google Drive has allowed me to go paperless 
len ratingfive Every file for every client in the past years is in my pocket 
len ratingfive It sure beats the briefcase full of bricks 
len ratingfive I love this app it helps me write essays file important documents and keep all my papers organized 
len ratingfive User Friendly Fast and excellent 
len ratingthree Wish it had a page number to input or bookmark to skip to last page that I left off
len ratingone This app was great until I updated 
len ratingone On my MacBook I make notes on my PDFs in preview and save them to Google Drive 
len ratingone Before I could view my pdf notes on Google Drive but now I can t 
len ratingone All my notes are gone 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive I do volunteer work at a cemetery and receive a lot of questions as to where people are buried 
len ratingfive I keep a list of all buried and their location on the drive 
len ratingfive When a question comes up out comes my phone and within a few seconds I have an answer to ever asked the question 
len ratingfive Quick and helpful 
len ratingfive Awesome app Use it everyday for work
len ratingfive G Drive is free and sync with any OS computer or phones 
len ratingfive Download recommended YES 
len ratingfive The best idea and innovation since M M candies 
len ratingfive Thanks for making life so easy 
len ratingone It is not as integrated to other software or operating systems as Dropbox is though it costs almost the same 
len ratingone as to your photos and videos is notes from your iPad or iPhone forget they exist you have scarce access to them
len ratingone I can t think of anything more pathetic than a large tech company faking their app reviews 
len ratingone Aside from that this is one of the worst apps I ve ever used 
len ratingone I can t download files I send to myself because I have to sync my entire device to be able to do that to a unknown server somewhere 
len ratingone Resumes keep getting more polished and software just keeps getting worse 
len ratingone This is what happens when web devs run the world 
len ratingone Patiently waiting until you re dethroned 
len ratingfive Amazing helps with school work a lot 
len ratingfive This is the best way for organizing my my text documents and easiest method for sending items to teachers 
len ratingfive It s great for college students and students in general 
len ratingfive You can work on group projects in your phone save things print things 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app 
len ratingone  I can t create ANYTHING without the apps all I can do is edit the other stuff I created 
len ratingone Disappointing 
len ratingone And it s mean a YEAR 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive J aime google drive
len ratingfive Drive has provided an efficient manner to connect other employees when staff meetings are not feasible 
len ratingfive The only improvement I would like is converting Word docs to Google 
len ratingfive This syncs nicely with apple iPad and files populate wonderfully
len ratingone Every time I attach my resume from Google Drive Chrome freezes up 
len ratingone I m trying to download photos from Google Drive but for some reason it s compressing the heck out of them 
len ratingone I tried it on OneDrive and didn t have this issue 
len ratingone Please fix this asap 
len ratingthree st of all most of my important videos are done forever 
len ratingthree It s been missing from my drive 
len ratingthree And why did you remove the best feature 
len ratingthree The one where we can lock the drive with a password or Touch id 
len ratingone My employer requires workers to use GDrive for certain types of documents and it provides huge amounts of GDrive storage 
len ratingone This would seem like a good deal except that GDrive is such an unreliable app 
len ratingone Problems are many and persistent I suspect Google has no interest in fixing them 
len ratingone Problems include quitting without warning even when my computer has an internet connection 
len ratingone Speed 
len ratingone This has two components both weak 
len ratingone Drive also has a decidedly casual approach to doing anything often waiting long periods before attempting to sync data between my computer and the cloud 
len ratingone Poor features 
len ratingone Frankly it is much more convenient to share folders files and links with almost any other popular cloud service Dropbox SugarSync than it is with GDrive 
len ratingone Bottom line GoogleDrive is crap but I am required to use it 
len ratingfive I love how you can do so many things with your memories 
len ratingfive I always make sure my new phones get drive 
len ratingfour I have been using Drive for several years both at work and at home 
len ratingfour Always handy with everything I need within reach by any of my computing devices 
len ratingfive Really useful
len ratingfive Very easy to use I m very thankful
len ratingone  Security issues galore and now meddling in elections 
len ratingone Employees altering search engine results to sway users to a particular candidate 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone I m migrating ALL of my data to iCloud and Dropbox and never using Google products again 
len ratingone Can t stand google s drive or any of the google docs 
len ratingone Such awful interfaces and redundant menu items make it easy to get lost and frustrating for even a nerd 
len ratingone Phooey 
len ratingfive I scan or upload almost everything to the drive 
len ratingfive I have restaurant menus health fitness folders videos owners guides and more 
len ratingfive It s always handy and there when I need it 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive The app is really good and I hope it is really good and I hope it is really with the money 
len ratingfive Easy to use and highly efficient
len ratingone There s no accurate syncing between google photos and the photos folder in Drive 
len ratingfive It is so use full for school uses
len ratingfive I am years old and I love it
len ratingfive Not once has Google Drive gotten me lost or took me up one way roads or left me hanging with road destruction detours 
len ratingfive Love it use it often 
len ratingone Why can t I move a file that was downloaded to drive to a documents file 
len ratingone No problem on androids
len ratingfive This is amazing how it stores files
len ratingthree Please add some tools for pdf reading highlights underline 
len ratingfive I love that I can access my files from just about anywhere including my phone 
len ratingfive It is extremely convenient and easy to access my files and the access is life saving when I forget to carry my laptop 
len ratingfive Been using google drive for some time now 
len ratingfive It js free and it is essential 
len ratingfive Easy to use and easy to share 
len ratingfive Like water we can take it for granted until it s gone 
len ratingfive Great access 
len ratingfive Loved it 
len ratingone  Can t edit pdf files
len ratingfive Like most things from google Google Drive is amazing and ever evolving to be better 
len ratingfour Google drive is ok but needs some changes
len ratingone I can t figure out how to navigate on my iPad 
len ratingone The iPad interface seems to be completely different than the iMac interface 
len ratingone I have two accounts and I cannot figure out how to switch from one to the other 
len ratingtwo I ve utilized google drive with the iPad Pencil which has worked great when annotating PDFs on iOS 
len ratingtwo This does not work in iOS 
len ratingtwo Until there is annotation for pdf I suggest staying away 
len ratingtwo Plus their link for app support is 
len ratingfive Google drive is like A sauce 
len ratingfive I put it on everything 
len ratingfive Please expand the ability to upload from it no matter what app you are creating 
len ratingfive I like this
len ratingone Haven t been able to inter figure out all the different aspects of changing frm yahoo to google then cetting i fo from one place to the other Message images to images Images to file Where are the files Transfer info from bank to sheets and then retrieve them Get images from my bank to anyone so i can work the info 
len ratingfive Google Drive is my go to storage choice 
len ratingfive I can easily download and retrieve a secure drive 
len ratingfive The integration with my iPhone app is also smooth 
len ratingfive I am less impressed with Google apps as they respond slowly to edits 
len ratingtwo It appears to me that I can t save my Drive photos because there is no save to camera roll option in my Drive settings 
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingfive Easy Access to all files 
len ratingfive Great app all around 
len ratingfive Enough said 
len ratingfour Google has great apps as everyone knows some features aren t as easily accessible as on the computer which is a given can t think of any specifics but overall great app 
len ratingfive It s a wonderful and great app to install 
len ratingfive It s a great place to store all my downloaded knitting and sewing patterns 
len ratingfive  Google Drive earns an A but a few of the reviewers could use a grammar lesson OMGosh I literally could not understand any points you were trying to make 
len ratingfive Usually when you go up for air a comma or a simple period will suffice 
len ratingfive Or maybe you had to save and re start over and over again using a thumb drive instead of using google drive as with any google enabled device 
len ratingfive That will hinder anyone s thoughts 
len ratingone I ve been trying to upload videos for the last past five days this is Ridiculous 
len ratingone None of the videos are over one minute long 
len ratingone As an IT administrator I need this functionality to work for my clients 
len ratingfive This app is extremely useful 
len ratingfive I use it all the time to store access files 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Oh man this is so good 
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingone This app is a trash can
len ratingfive Awesome organizational tool and file sharing app for pros and average joes 
len ratingfive I just love google drive it s so easy to use and store all of my important documents
len ratingfive Love using this software and be able to share with my colleagues 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive I ll sharing my soccer drill with players and parents with all league information 
len ratingone Won t open files
len ratingfive Drive is a great app that allows me to stay in touch with my documents on the go 
len ratingfive Ma
len ratingfive  and has the best priced storage 
len ratingfive Works across iOS and Android I m syncing between an iPad and windows PC right now 
len ratingfive Simple easy and saves even if you accidentally X out the page
len ratingone The app does not work very well whatsoever 
len ratingone If you want to download anything when u have pictures of vids to download have fun doing it one by one 
len ratingone You can t select multiple to download at once
len ratingone I hate this its horrible pls delete
len ratingone When they are available to see why are the dates not in order and how do I know what year they were submitted 
len ratingone I m interested with Transparency but until I have the ability to see the reviews star is generous 
len ratingone WHAT Are You HIDING 
len ratingone Unfortunately the Google drive application has a huge flaw in that it reduces the resolution of photos upon saving to the iPhone with no option to choose alter the resolution 
len ratingone This is a crippling flaw for someone who loves sharing higher resolution photos
len ratingfive Love the versatility Drive gives me to have access to files from any device at home or on the road 
len ratingfive I like that it also connects to Evernote 
len ratingfive Google drive is one of those FANTASTIC tools that are used everyday 
len ratingfive Google drive is great because you can save almost ANY file and not have it corrupted 
len ratingfive I remember using ICloud and getting lots of corrupted files and videos I think this is great 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingtwo Why can t I rename things from outside the file 
len ratingfive Great for school and editing on the fly 
len ratingfive This is awesome 
len ratingone The title bar kept invoke while reading that make zoom reset
len ratingfive  It s so amazing with all the useful tools 
len ratingfive It makes my school day easy 
len ratingthree I am an occasional user of Google documents and Google drive 
len ratingthree So I may not have had enough practice to get used to how they work 
len ratingthree But I find it difficult to find things that people share with me unless it s been recent and shows up at the top of the list 
len ratingthree The longer I use this service the longer my list of shared documents gets 
len ratingthree I don t know how to organize my shared documents and folders 
len ratingthree I only know how to organize the files that I create myself 
len ratingfour I would prefer if I didn t have to download a separate app in order to edit my docs n sheets etc etc
len ratingfive I love to use this for school projects or just saving simply pictures on my computer or phone
len ratingfive I use the Drive for school and work and love it 
len ratingtwo Can t move files to folders from recent ive been experimenting with different cloudservices and in my opinion Dropbox and one drive work way better than this junk
len ratingfive I feel Google drive is always the best way one can share data online with others because of its simplicity and easiness 
len ratingfour The only thing I dislike is that if I try to upload over photos at a time the app crashes so I have to upload pictures at like at a time 
len ratingfour Other than that I use it for my personal stuff and for school 
len ratingfive This is a great place to store all my hentai I mean edits 
len ratingfive I wish it had more gb of storage tho 
len ratingfive Goooood
len ratingone  Please please please bring me the passcode system as it was before 
len ratingone I need it badly 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingfive I am so excited 
len ratingfive As I scrolled through Google Drive I found articles that I thought were lost or weren t saved 
len ratingfive Those include college papers from over years 
len ratingfive My teaching practice video is included as well 
len ratingfive Wow I am really appreciative 
len ratingfive Google Drive the best 
len ratingone I m not a computer geek but I know how to navigate most software 
len ratingone This drive is complicated and I m yet to figure it out 
len ratingone I believe I m going to stick with the One Drive I have with my outlook account 
len ratingone It s simple and I figured that out in minutes 
len ratingone I ve spent many hours hoping to figuring this out and now deleted the app on my iPhone X 
len ratingfive I had I ROBLOX account from a long time ago and google saved for me
len ratingfive I need a new version to help me create promotion for my MPE productions 
len ratingfive I m a medical professional and my google drive allows me to keep de identified clinical information and huge amounts of educational material stored and available in an instant 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfour GDRIVE is a good app but if there was more assistance available to help navigate it easier 
len ratingone  Google should stop suppressing legal conservative speech 
len ratingfive The most perfect way of organization
len ratingfive It really works for me for the amount of videos I have to Store its awesome 
len ratingfour This is a test of this program 
len ratingfour I am not clear on the purpose and function of the app 
len ratingfour I need more information 
len ratingfive Replace my iPhone and Ipad storage 
len ratingfive Have much more room now 
len ratingfive The once a yr data plan should be TB at a cheaper price so I wont need to buy iTunes every month 
len ratingfive Otherwise it s wonderful 
len ratingone I had to tear a whole in space time to send a simple document from my home scanner through my iPhone via Gmail 
len ratingone Back to the land of Windows where they actually seem to care about compatibility and ease of use 
len ratingfive It s helpful and easy to use 
len ratingone  Google is suppressing online conservative free speech 
len ratingone Google should not take advantage of its position to infringe on legal First Amendment rights of those whom it does not agree 
len ratingone Google should be regulated by Congress as it is apparent they cannot be trusted to not be evil 
len ratingfive  This is an awesome app
len ratingthree Unable to review or open some shared documents
len ratingfour Just add passcode and touch ID in application and it will be perfect 
len ratingone I had to uninstall because Google Drive is breaking normal file opening behavior 
len ratingone Opening files with extensions like docx and html from iOS Files app or the DropBox app causes Google Drive to launch and insist upon saving the file 
len ratingone The save then fails and I can no longer view these files at all 
len ratingone This is a really nasty bug 
len ratingthree There is a bug that doesnt allow you to close pdf documents without freezing the app and the only way to access the rest of the app again is to close and reopen it 
len ratingthree Other than that it s fine
len ratingfive Great idea to have free storage
len ratingone Slim it down 
len ratingfive Bad omahalol fujdjhddheeerbbifrbbr 
len ratingfive D died 
len ratingfive Ddue eudbeid
len ratingfive Great speed flexibility on data 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone I m on an iPhone S and when wiring an email and trying to attach a PDF document it s nowhere to be found 
len ratingone Using my iPhone I found the document in my PDF app and saved it to One Drive Drop Box iCloud and Google Drive 
len ratingone But when I hit the ATTACH link in my email it takes me to an unnamed drive that is none of the above 
len ratingone Why aren t all of you available to my Google email 
len ratingone Please fix this bug in your app 
len ratingone It s infuriating that I can t open the sheet I select 
len ratingtwo Whenever I need to upload a file mostly audio files and they are bigger than MB the app does stops uploading as soon as the phone blocks it blocks at minutes 
len ratingtwo I have to keep tapping the app so it does not block or it will pause uploading 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating

len ratingtwo I have to keep tapping the app so it does not block or it will pause uploading

len ratingtwo Please return this option in settings for the next update 
len ratingfive I organized my book club with this app 
len ratingfive Keep doing what you re doing google 
len ratingfive Very good storage Drive
len ratingone With each update files are harder to find 
len ratingone The app was much easier a few years ago 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive Would that ALL my apps were so helpful 
len ratingfive They call me Cybergrandpa and I can navigate this one with ease 
len ratingfive It great
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingfour It helps with school work although the uploading process is a little wonky 
len ratingthree I wish you could have multiple pages up at the same time 
len ratingfour I love Google Drive 
len ratingfour To make it even better please add real photo thumbnails for files to assist with easily locating files 
len ratingfour Also after opening a folder I would like to be able to see the number of total files at the bottom of the folder window contents info 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingone Unless you re a millennial or grew up in the s or later this is hard to use 
len ratingone If you re like me iPhone owner I m considered a dinosaur 
len ratingone Maybe the proprietary Apple brand everything has me locked into Apple only everything maybe I m supposed to not learn Google based tech 
len ratingone The interface of the when it comes to sharing is always a frustration in I still don t get it 
len ratingone Won t sync to my computer 
len ratingone On line instructions don t match what comes on my computer trying to fix the problem
len ratingthree The products in drive are fine but sheets slides and docs have less bells and whistles that Microsoft office products 
len ratingthree You need to up grade drive to give those that are office experts abilities we could count on in office 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingtwo Hi I m having problems loading my videos from google drive to my camera roll 
len ratingtwo Sometimes it will work and sometimes it doesn t 
len ratingtwo I ve tried reloading the app and shutting my phone off 
len ratingtwo This drives me crazy 
len ratingtwo If this wasn t a issue it would be great but it s not dependable 
len ratingtwo I d like to get my videos on my y t channel and it s frustrating to not be able to when I m ready 
len ratingfive Love it more than my next breath of life giving air
len ratingthree Need pin passcode lock
len ratingfive The app is great but i just wish we could see the artwork of an album when playing a song
len ratingfive I use Google Drive for everything 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive Very promising and easy to use
len ratingfive Love this app so user friendly and useful for everyday life 
len ratingfive Love it Thanks

len ratingfour If I use the mail from school to registrar a google drive I can t share my file to other people without confirm in the email can I just set it on the google drive 
len ratingfive I love the google drive it s so convenient and I love that it automatically it saves what I am working on it just saves me the worries of thinking if I saved something or not 
len ratingfive I also love that you can great documents that I can share with others and we can all complete a task without having to be in the same office or room 
len ratingfive I love google docs

len ratingfour screen size helps 
len ratingfour So I go to school to start a new school year 
len ratingfour I get a new schedule 
len ratingfour And I get a new password for my Google account 
len ratingfour And what happens the next time I try to sign in 
len ratingfour My password doesn t work 
len ratingfour Can you guys please fix this bug 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone  aug no ability to quickly select multiple pictures for uploading 
len ratingone When you do spend alot of time tapping each of several pictures often during the queued upload the app will stall or get stuck at preparing to upload or if you switch from Wi Fi to LTE during uploads the queue will freeze and never resume 
len ratingone  lack of progress or new features in the minimal updates that google rarely puts out and when they do add a app update it s just to say we put out an update which is why they don t provide version history or change log 
len ratingone mar When dealing with search results if you tap a folder there is no way to navigate up or even know where that folder is in your entire directory structure 
len ratingone To be clear I m only talking about search results for example you type in you search for pictures then tap a folder name in the search results there is no way to tell where you re at in your entire folder structure 
len ratingone There is no way to navigate to the parent folder ie the equivalent of the Linux command CD or clicking the up arrow in windows explorer Search is the entire point of Google drive and part of its core functionality thus I don t understand why on the iOS app search and folder navigation of your search results is so poor and lacking 
len ratingone If you have two folders named pictures spread out through your entire folder structure there is no way to know which one is where once you have tapped it 
len ratingfive Best app
len ratingfive RIP Microsoft Office can t remember the last time I lost data due to Office crashing 
len ratingone Do I need to download it 
len ratingfive You guys should add a next button for when playing audio off google drive i hate switching back and forth
len ratingfive Great platform for group work and saves money on buying Microsoft office
len ratingfour No u
len ratingfive Cool

len ratingfive I love Google Cloud 
len ratingfive This App works perfectly and the G U I 
len ratingfive it s great and easy to use 
len ratingfive Perfectly match for different operative system 
len ratingfive I love how DRIVE automatically backs up files from my pc this saved me from losing all of my important files many years ago 
len ratingfive I love how I can see files from my PC on my iPad or on my phone 
len ratingfive Only downside is that occasionally it seems that DRIVE is running very long and slows my PC down 
len ratingfive This problem is worth the benefits of having my files backed up to the cloud 
len ratingfour Wish organizing the files was a little more simple and less confusing 
len ratingone Why can t I edit files on this app 
len ratingone Why do I have to download this app in addition to sheets Sheets 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Excelente aplicaci n 
len ratingfive Google Drive has show itself to be invaluable as I often must return to it to review my notes and share with other users 
len ratingfive Lobe it s 
len ratingfour Great product 
len ratingfour Wish could access music from drive to google play 
len ratingfour Only reason not 
len ratingfive Can t imagine it being more user friendly Or useful Best google software besides Google itself
len ratingfour Anyways Can t You Like PUT A File In A Game 
len ratingfour Still that s why I put a star sry but D 
len ratingfive Easy to organize photos 
len ratingfive Free GB storage is generous 
len ratingthree  After update passcode lock not available google drive please add passcode lock on google drive 
len ratingfive All of the Google apps work seamlessly ON my iPhone 
len ratingfive I can save files and easily retrieve them 
len ratingfive Google Drive app works well with files used most often 
len ratingfive I use the Sheets app for rosters and club tracking 
len ratingfive It is easier than using a spreadsheet program on a PC 
len ratingfive Just like all google products this is stream lined and is excellent user friendly app 
len ratingfive I love that there is still free tech 
len ratingfive I can t uploads pictures from gallery
len ratingfour Great app for organizing and locating videos 
len ratingfour Please improve the video playback capabilities 
len ratingfour It is hard to rewind or fast forward 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingfive I am in the Marine Corps and everything I need to keep track of for work and school I can keep organized here in my drive 
len ratingfive One of the biggest things I use on a daily bases 
len ratingfive I m glad to have Google Drive for my iPhone
len ratingtwo Adding to my previous review it still forces page breaks as described below 
len ratingtwo Which makes using the app for me useless 
len ratingtwo An additional issue it takes quite some time for the App to grab updated information 
len ratingtwo I recently updated a file 
len ratingtwo It took minutes for the app to show the edits made 
len ratingtwo While Google Drive through a browser showed the update nearly instantly 
len ratingtwo Initial Review For the most part I love this app 
len ratingtwo A recent update made a change that I do NOT like 
len ratingtwo When opening Excel files saved to the drive it now forces to page breaks 
len ratingtwo In other words if you have many columns you can t just move to the right and see more columns 
len ratingtwo It forces to the next page 
len ratingtwo This is not a good thing to do to an excel file 
len ratingtwo If it can t put say months of columns it needs to scroll 
len ratingtwo I don t want Nov Dec on the next page 
len ratingtwo No matter want I do I can t see say the last quarter oct dec 
len ratingtwo You could scroll right on the old version 
len ratingfive Simple is genius and drive is simple 
len ratingtwo Uploading more than pics at a time causes it to crash 
len ratingtwo Need to load in smaller batches 
len ratingfive Totally love the G life 
len ratingfive Muy buena
len ratingone I can open documents seldomly 
len ratingone Constantly get an oops message 
len ratingone Blech
len ratingfive I love google apps 
len ratingfive I use them across everything and they sync very easily across all my devices 
len ratingfive Drive is substantially better than the cloud drive apple made which to be honest is a sad excuse for a files storage app 
len ratingfive The pricing for more storage is also much better than apple drive 
len ratingfive Thank you google for another flawless application 
len ratingone Needs to be able to lock the app from others 
len ratingone There is no security 
len ratingone Update with the features please 
len ratingfive Convenient user friendly large storage allocation easily accessible to any of my computers as I download desktop versions 
len ratingfive It hasn t failed me so far 
len ratingfive Definitely recommended 
len ratingfive Pretty easy
len ratingfive C est un bon endroit de stockage et il est la porte de l utilisateur l o il est moi je l utilise souvent et je le vois tr s utile 
len ratingfive Slt
len ratingfive I believe this is the best and easiest solution for data storage 
len ratingfive This helps me so much for school 
len ratingfive So does google classroom 
len ratingfive When I need to upload pictures it always works and is super fast and easy 
len ratingfive This book encourages and giving detailed information that s important when you want to share but don t know how 
len ratingfive Awesomeness 
len ratingone All week google drive and gmail won t open when prompted by iPhone or iPad 
len ratingone Went thru cycle many times and final got option for password which opened both 
len ratingone Every time I m on computer google goes thru this 
len ratingone There s no online assistance 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive The fewer add on solutions I need for my biz make me bring more of my workload to google 
len ratingone Should be able to use my thumbprint on the iPhone to login Apple people should never use this terrible software because too much time
len ratingfive Keep up the good work
len ratingone I am not able to make any changes in the docs I receive from our school teachers even though I have the app and it s active 
len ratingone No clue why not 
len ratingone Same problems with the drive on my pc 
len ratingone It s astonishing that this app is so enthusiastically supported 
len ratingone The iOS files app gracefully aggregates any variety of cloud storage solutions 
len ratingone I use iCloud Dropbox and OneDrive dragging and dropping massive files between them all from within the Files app 
len ratingone With Google Drive I get none of this functionality 
len ratingone Are people so plugged into the Google ecosystem that they don t notice when there s virtually no interoperability 
len ratingone I mean what is this even for 
len ratingone  Google is suppressing online conservative free speech 
len ratingone Google should not take advantage of its position to infringe on legal First Amendment rights of those whom it does not agree 
len ratingone Google should be regulated in this regard as it is apparent they cannot be trusted to not be evil 
len ratingfive Indispensable 
len ratingfive It really nice to have google drive when you have a business 
len ratingfive Go check out my slime business
len ratingone Pictures keep re appearing and making double copies
len ratingfive But gotta love drive
len ratingone It would be better if you were able to select all and send all through the app instead of just on a computer
len ratingfive No bugs
len ratingone I see I have a notification but there s nothing marked 
len ratingone Frustrating 
len ratingone Is there any way I can share more than one file at once 
len ratingone Falta o recurso de alterar a velocidade de reprodu o de v deos neste app 
len ratingfive I basically have my Mac on any device 
len ratingfive Organized exactly the way I my laptop is 
len ratingfive They should make provisions to be able to password protect a file
len ratingone Downloaded Google Drive to use for driving 
len ratingone But it seems there s no way to input current location and set destination 
len ratingone How come 
len ratingfive I love to use G drive for my in house network and access to files in the field
len ratingone I wish it had better security features 
len ratingone It needs passcode n Touch ID too 
len ratingone  Google is suppressing online conservative speech 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingfive Informative and objective 
len ratingfive I use it often
len ratingthree Needs to work better on mobile with PDFs
len ratingfive Easy to use cool app 
len ratingfive Helps access store and update documents on the fly 
len ratingthree  Zoomed PDFs jump to full screen when scrolling 
len ratingthree Older versions did not do that 
len ratingthree Please change back 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingfour One thing stops google drive from being perfect is its inability to edit pdf files 
len ratingfive Simple and easy to use 
len ratingfive Extremely useful 
len ratingfive Since I use an IPhone this is the only way I can save files until I can get online 
len ratingfive I ve found Google Drive about the same quality ease of use practicality and functionality as Dropbox 
len ratingfive Both are excellent 
len ratingfive Both allow large format file sharing and storage 
len ratingfive Not sure the max storage on Drive 
len ratingfive DB has a max but I can usually keep files below the max either way 
len ratingthree Ok I love this for school and everything but the thing is that when ever my teacher assigns stuff it never shows up 
len ratingfive Better than drop box
len ratingfour Drive is very useful but it can be difficult to use when logged into a different Gmail account
len ratingfive I like Drive it s good I use to keep iterations of my work 
len ratingfive But don t ask for review in middle of download
len ratingfive Drive is the best
len ratingtwo Not very user friendly 
len ratingtwo You can do better google 
len ratingfive We forgot a phone but the driver was flexible and cheerfully returned to our home 
len ratingfive It s better then having to carry around those darn little USB chips 
len ratingfive I always loose mine 
len ratingfive And those I didn t loose eventually malfunctioned and stopped working anyways 
len ratingfive I d loose all my data 
len ratingfive Now everytime I need to print or take a file with me I just upload it to my google drive and I can have all my important with me 
len ratingfive Best of all I can even use it on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Can t get any better then this 
len ratingfive Maybe more free space lol but I m not complaining 
len ratingfive Good job google 
len ratingfive Thanks for the service 
len ratingfive I like this one 
len ratingfive Works flawlessly with all tablet phone and PC OS s 
len ratingfive I store various user manuals which can be accessed across all platforms 
len ratingfive Bravo 
len ratingfour I want an easy way to share photos and videos
len ratingone I am trying to use my google drive on an iPad mini 
len ratingone What I am trying to do is create a docs that has pictures in it but I can t seem to find an add button to do so
len ratingfive Thanx google
len ratingone Going on weeks now that I ve paid to upgrade my storage 
len ratingone I ve emailed google no response 
len ratingone About to cancel hopefully someone else will read this and not waste their time 
len ratingone It s not like there are any actual humans you can call 
len ratingfive I ve been using this app for about a year now to write my novel and blogs 
len ratingfive I absolutely love that it automatically saves my files while I m drafting them 
len ratingfive I never have to worry about files disappearing or not saving like I did with iCloud 
len ratingfive The only thing I wish it had was a night mode like Twitter or Kindle does since most of the time I use it at night in bed when I can t sleep 
len ratingfive GREAT PLACE TO STORE MY SIDECHICKS NUDES SO MY GIRL DOESNT FIND EM TOTALLY USE IT AGAIN
len ratingfive It s the most AMAZING advancement ever 
len ratingfive Seamless and easy to use 
len ratingfive It s so convenient to have access from wherever you are and so easy to share files with others 
len ratingfive I can t do it anymore without it 
len ratingone  Crashes every time I play an audio file 
len ratingone Needs an update to fix this problem 
len ratingfive R
len ratingfive O line of Color is the day you get a chance to get it
len ratingfive Great service thank you 
len ratingfive Help me to organize my life my job and homework wherever I go 
len ratingfive Awesome to access send and comment from handheld fast 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingone It took me minutes to open a MB PDF that I was FORCED to put in Google Drive because the file was over MB then when I finally got it open it crashed before I could open the file in iBooks just to save a freaking copy on my iPad and I had to start over 
len ratingone This is

len ratingfive Very simple and easy to keep track of everythinf

len ratingfive It stores my files all across all my devices

len ratingthree Hey 
len ratingthree Nice but this app doesn t have any security anymore can access to your private photos and videos so next update try to add fingers sprint like other apps 
len ratingthree I searched all the settings and didn t find it 
len ratingthree But if you guys know let me know please 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive The app has been flawless and made my life much more productive
len ratingone This app used to be useful to jump back and for with photos from phone to desktop but it s absolutely worthless now and why on earth do I now need a second app for Google photos but it s still stored in Drive 
len ratingone The sort feature is worthless and photos random disappear and reappear later 
len ratingtwo I was hoping you could edit the documents 
len ratingfive Maravilloso 
len ratingfive This is a really awesome useful app 
len ratingfive It makes working on the go with others very simple 
len ratingfive Ive been using it to save everything from books to music videos and it works like a charm
len ratingfive Yes I too have Google Drive on my iPhone and I LOVE it still 
len ratingfive  Still because I was an Android Drone for many years

len ratingthree Sometimes I want a copy of a file to send on my phone but the only option is to send a link to the file on drive 
len ratingthree Not good enough 
len ratingfive Great app from Google 
len ratingfive Every one needs for reading on the go
len ratingtwo I m trying to download videos on google drive to my iPhone to edit 
len ratingtwo When I go to Save a copy Save video it just says preparing to export but nothing is actually there 
len ratingfive Loving that I can use google Drive on my phone making it easy to do sign up sheets and attach share information with friends and clients 
len ratingfive There s a bug on my current version of Google Drive that when I try to open a file freezes the screen and requires me to exit the app to proceed 
len ratingfive Please address this ASAP it is very distracting and troublesome when I try to access my documents 
len ratingtwo Difficult to navigate how to open files that say unsupported and gives no explanation of how to gain access to do so 
len ratingone The site works great on my computer but the app mixes up files 
len ratingone I click on one to load but it opens another file 
len ratingone Useless

len ratingfive  Respect

len ratingfive Me and my business partner would lost with out this app

len ratingfive My friend Bonnie has an amazing singing voice 
len ratingfive The quality is wonderful 
len ratingfive Simply awesome I love having the ability to access my drive ANYWHERE 
len ratingfive I can use it for my book I m writing 
len ratingfive And download everything including my Medical Records 
len ratingfive It s Great 
len ratingthree I would think that Google could make it simple to use online storage 
len ratingthree It is cumbersome to use Drive 
len ratingthree And I have to wait for Drive that is in my File Explorer on the computer to catch up to what is online 
len ratingfive The perfect organizer
len ratingfive Great collaboration tool and doesn t take up space in my inbox 
len ratingfive Love the real time changes 
len ratingfive While teaching middle school it was a fantastic to use with my writing students 
len ratingfive I was able to share support and monitor their work in real time to support writing skill acquisition 
len ratingfive It made all the difference 
len ratingfive Google drive and the related apps are amazing because they let me share in real time documents with colleagues friends and family 
len ratingfive I ve used it for everything from revising documents with multiple approvers awesome for version control 
len ratingfive to planning vacation activities in Google Sheets 
len ratingfive Everything is available from any device any time I need it 
len ratingfive Can t say enough good things about it 
len ratingfive I have had this for about a year now 
len ratingfive I can not say enough of the good experiences I have had with it 
len ratingfive Needs to be able to download multiple items to phone at once
len ratingfive  nice
len ratingfour There doesn t seem a way to unzip files on the iPad version of Google Drive 
len ratingfour It s a hassle having to switch to my laptop 
len ratingfour Can you add this capability 
len ratingfour Another opportunity for improving user experience is making it native when opening a Doc 
len ratingfour On the laptop version I stay in Google Drive for that 
len ratingfour That s better 
len ratingfour Great app but photos don t always load in full or even acceptable resolution
len ratingone Can t open anything 
len ratingone Help 
len ratingone Every time it stops working I can t understand it 
len ratingone Just useless 
len ratingfive Google drive is great 
len ratingfive This place keeps all my files nice and organized 
len ratingfive Drive and its component apps have been excellent and keep getting better 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive I lost my important documents but thanks to google drive 
len ratingfive I can drive anywhere without any trouble or fear about my important files and folders 
len ratingfive I lost my mobile few months back by accident and I thought I lost very important audio clip but great full to the developer who made this google drive 
len ratingfive I could recover the same audio clip in my new mobile which I uploaded at google drive beforehand 
len ratingfive I could recover it at my pc also 
len ratingfive Really wonderful and awesome 
len ratingone Something major changed overnight from aug to aug n Ow my files aren t working
len ratingtwo I ve used Drive on and off for a half dozen years 
len ratingtwo It used to be awesome 
len ratingtwo It used to be flawless 
len ratingtwo Much like Google it used to actually do what it was supposed to do and now it clearly has no idea what it is 
len ratingtwo I use gb of personal space primarily to store photos because I don t need google photos running facial recognition on everyone I happen to shoot 
len ratingtwo I m a professional photographer these files range from mb each 
len ratingtwo With every upload drive fails to load previews then crashes 
len ratingtwo Restart it it crashes unable to show a simple thumbnail 
len ratingtwo What s more I can no longer save directly from the web to drive because of security permissions and zero functional interoperability with my OS 
len ratingtwo The app will work if I uninstall it after each upload then reinstall before looking at my photos 
len ratingtwo Is it worth it to have to reinstall a failure of a piece of crap every two days 
len ratingtwo No 
len ratingtwo Do I have a choice 
len ratingtwo No my employer uses it 
len ratingtwo The least you could do Alphabet is properly support and vet products 
len ratingtwo I stopped buying google products or using their services for anything except what I have no choice in and that s reconfirmed every time I need to rely on their unreliable and half developed products 
len ratingfive Room for improvement but currently best in field
len ratingone PDFs won t print to my printer if the it s through canvas how do I fix this 
len ratingthree We are using Google Drive on a large project with a lot of people but it has been very finicky and not as user friendly as I would have liked
len ratingfive As a writer and an artist google drive is like my best fiend 
len ratingfive Always there when I need it 
len ratingfive Google drive has a great memory and holds my special moments dear 
len ratingfive I am able to write from anywhere and feel confident because my work is immediately saved 
len ratingfive I appreciate all of you at google for this essential tool in my life 
len ratingfive Thank you all 
len ratingfive I m learning and liking so far
len ratingtwo People store sensitive documents in Google Drive 
len ratingtwo Before it was possible to lock the app and its content with TouchID 
len ratingtwo It was remove for some reason several months ago with no explanation 
len ratingtwo Please bring this feature back 
len ratingfive Easy to maneuver through files and apps and ability to share with certain individuals
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive It downloads your documents perfectly and works properly 
len ratingfive Let s you complete assignments that are just how you want them 
len ratingfive I enjoy all the features included 
len ratingone Stop asking for feedback
len ratingthree Permissions thing is annoying
len ratingfive As long as you have internet access Google drive is the best 
len ratingfive No longer to I worry about leaving losing corrupting my flash drive 
len ratingfive Nor do I wonder if the flash drive I have is the one I actually wanted 
len ratingfive Oh no 
len ratingfive Now ALL my stuff is available wherever I go 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Love it lol
len ratingone Google drive is controlling my life 
len ratingfive I LOVE THE FACT YOU DON T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY FILES THAT U DOWNLOADED ONTO DRIVE IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE 
len ratingfive I do Everything on google 
len ratingfive Search create explore you name it 
len ratingfive Manage my finances on google sheets 
len ratingfive Create work documents and never have to worry where they are stored 
len ratingfive I ve become super organized with google 
len ratingfive Golden have all your files on all devices 
len ratingfive Only suggestion a loop option when playing audio files would make it perfect 
len ratingfive This app saves my life 
len ratingfive Having these folders and files at my fingertips EVERYWHERE I go is so key to staying on top of things 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingone I have seen the number on the icon and just cant figure out what is it 
len ratingone There is no signal to notify me that i have sth to see 
len ratingone Just a number above the icon 
len ratingfive No complaints I use the freebie 
len ratingfive I wish that they will increase the size of free storage and someday I will switch to the paid upgrade 
len ratingfive  Absolutely love MyDrive Crome and just all of it 
len ratingfive The way I can access it all is genius 
len ratingfive Stable and works good
len ratingfive  It s always handy to have my important files ready to export or send to our prospects and clients love it
len ratingfour All I wanted to do was make a file and fill it with photos of my car accident 
len ratingfour I spent over an hour trying out different buttons finally took a break got my head straight and was finally able to make the file folder with the belongings I needed 
len ratingfive Super useful for university 
len ratingfive This review is solely for the ability to upload audio onto Facebook as a septic heading says 
len ratingfive It s beyond me why Facebook doesn t have its own audio capability but some people do use Facebook and so there was a need and after trying many other options which were either nearly impossible or specious finally found this way via Internet search and it does the trick in spades 
len ratingfive My terrible organizational skills depend on Google Drive where I have everything in one place 
len ratingthree  Add back the ability to password protect 
len ratingthree Just because I let someone use my device doesn t mean I want them to access my files 
len ratingthree Doesn t allow you to log your account out of the app 
len ratingfour Would like to see a shareable link for the entire team file instead of for each document 
len ratingfour It seems a waste of time 
len ratingfive Very useful
len ratingfour Love this app 
len ratingfour My only complaint so far is that it will not allow me to upload more than photos at a time from my iPhone X 
len ratingfour If it allowed significantly more uploads at a time directly from my phone I d give it a solid star rating 
len ratingfour Still it s free and serves my photo sharing and storage needs quite well 
len ratingfour Thanks Google 
len ratingfive I ve been using this feather for a long time and has been the most useful and easiest way to keep create files and share docs with my husband 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Easy to work with even if you re offline Like this app 
len ratingfive I use this a lot for school to collaborate with teams on documents and this works extremely well 
len ratingfive Updates are in real time and chat functionality is great too 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a great way to have access to files across multiple devices 
len ratingfour  Why did Google remove the password protection feature 
len ratingfour Just because I let someone use my device doesn t mean I want them to access my files 
len ratingfour Once you login to the app with your Google account you can t log out 
len ratingfive Access to my important client files in real time 
len ratingfive Whether I m at the office or on the road 
len ratingfive I use this for homework if I m on the plane or don t have WiFi or I can just write out my stuff on the notepad of my phone and then copy and paste when I get connected 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and you can upload pictures from your camera role to your drive so you can print them or have them in your drive 
len ratingone Very slow to save images and very difficult to download multiple pictures to my iPad 
len ratingone Hate this app 
len ratingfive Google docs and the entire suite has been such a great help to me both personally and professionally 
len ratingone No password protection after last update
len ratingfive Best 
len ratingfive Others are not as good as google drive 
len ratingfour  Why did Google remove the password protection feature 
len ratingfour Just because I let someone use my device doesn t mean I want them to access my files 
len ratingfour Once you login to the app with your Google account you can t log out 
len ratingfive Easy access to your productive live 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Super helpful
len ratingfive This app is perfect for organizing multiple documents of different subjects 
len ratingfive As a high school student this is so beneficial to me I don t have to lug around as many textbooks notebooks or worksheets 
len ratingthree  Add back the ability to password protect the drive just because I let someone else use device doesn t mean I want them to access my files 
len ratingthree Once you sign into your Google account in the app you can t sign out 
len ratingthree Cannot exit a video from full screen 
len ratingthree I have to exit and restart app 
len ratingthree Very frustrating 
len ratingthree This is the same on two different iOS devices 
len ratingthree Also PDF files are not supported 
len ratingthree They must be downloaded to the device and read offline using a different app 
len ratingthree Other than that storage is storage 
len ratingthree Not much to it 
len ratingone After renaming a file the app does not change the type 
len ratingone  IE from DOC to txt the app still recognizes it as a word file 
len ratingfive Helped me a lot cause I read too many books 
len ratingone  Deleted my review again without fixing the bugs 
len ratingone The app constantly freezes up when I m trying to open a document 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingone I don t know why but it often tends to show me a lower resumption of the uploaded photo rather than the original 
len ratingone To clarify I checked all images files and the file itself is not compressed but when I view them on google drive it s on lower resolution
len ratingfour  Add back the ability to password protect 
len ratingfour Just because I let someone use my device doesn t mean I want them to access my files 
len ratingfour Once you sign into your account you can t sign out of it 
len ratingone Alwayz no connection available whenever i try to open a doc from drive
len ratingfour Going on vacation and will not have laptop

len ratingfive I rely on this app for both personal uses and for professional work 
len ratingfive The portability of this app across my iPad cell phone and PC laptop creates a seamless environment between each device 
len ratingfive An additional positive is the software refinement over the years by Google 
len ratingone Somehow when I tap on the title of the spreadsheet I want to open the app opens a different spreadsheet 
len ratingone Annoying 
len ratingfour I absolutely love Google Drive 
len ratingfour My only issue and one that s preventing me from giving it stars is that you can t save multiple pictures at once 
len ratingfour You have to view the picture hold it down and it allows you to save that particular picture 
len ratingfive We usually associate everything with having internet and drive helps you understand files saving not saving connection or not 
len ratingone Attaching files is impossible 
len ratingone Can t save videos to camera roll on mobile
len ratingfive Love the fact that it does not use my iCloud storage
len ratingfive Car salesman slaps the roof of google drive This baby can fit so much photos 
len ratingone Wttfff i cant download vids from google drive what a useless app
len ratingfour  Add back the ability to password protect your drive

len ratingfive With this mobile app version I have access to things saved wherever I go 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingtwo Regardless of how many times I give any type of permission to view edit a drive file I m constantly getting emails to give permission 
len ratingtwo You should only have to choose this setting once and be done 
len ratingtwo Hire a competent UX designer already 
len ratingfive Very pleased with this app 
len ratingfive So reassuring to have this drive 
len ratingone  It was okay in the past but it doesnt work nowadays 
len ratingfive Muito bom
len ratingfive Great feature
len ratingone Even a second video takes well over an hour to upload and most of the time it fails 
len ratingone I was hoping to use Drive to organize both photos and videos but the slow upload time is making me reconsider both
len ratingone Unable to open zip file
len ratingfive Works as it should
len ratingfive Great that the iOS app grabs the most current version too 
len ratingfive Switching between app or browser on any device is so seamless 
len ratingfive I use this for work and for my own creative writing and I ll say that the ability to easily float from my phone to my laptop makes life worth loving 
len ratingfive If you use Google Mail and Google Drive just download the app and stop playing around 
len ratingone An update a couple months ago ruined excel spreadsheet viewing by eliminating tabs for different sheets within the workbook 
len ratingone Now all worksheets within a workbook are displayed in a single incongruous view which is unusable 
len ratingfive Google drive is a wonderful tool for business and school 
len ratingfive Maybe adding a dark feature for those of us that work at night to make it easier on the eyes would be helpful 
len ratingtwo I use this app every weekend to read my set list 
len ratingtwo This new update now won t show the edits one does on PDF files 
len ratingtwo I Edit my music sheets on adobe or Mac s preview app so I can see the edits on other apps and was able to do it on this one 
len ratingfive Appreciate for all kind of storage so in emergency I can use it 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree  I can t justify per year for TB since I have Office until February with automatic renewal turned on 
len ratingthree  GB may not be enough in a few years 
len ratingone You can t save images directly from the app to your camera roll 
len ratingone You have to go safari and it is honestly very annoying 
len ratingfive So for an enjoy the service 
len ratingfive Like
len ratingtwo I should not have to use the site 
len ratingtwo It s an app so make it an app 
len ratingtwo Sign in with the site 
len ratingtwo That s dumb 
len ratingtwo My phone doesn t allow internet so make it an app not a site 
len ratingfive Works great for me 
len ratingone I could type a document on my computer on Google Drive but it wouldn t show up in the app until months later 
len ratingone Furthermore it s always so behind in time that I ll open the app to see documents under edited this month that I worked on two to three months ago 
len ratingfive Google drive works great 
len ratingfive So love google drive without a home and an office yet I can still work from my cell in a hotel 
len ratingtwo When files are recently uploaded I d like to be able to access them quickly 
len ratingtwo Instead I have to dig as I don t have a Recently Uploaded view when using Google apps such as Gmail 
len ratingfive Great for voiceover uploads and sharing Www lasvegasacts con
len ratingfive Its the best thing since sliced bread
len ratingfive Apps like this are what make the world a better place
len ratingfive I really appreciate drive because it is always there and very reliable 
len ratingfive We use it faithfully for our church ministry to communicate changes in our services especially if a leader is unable to attend we don t miss a beat 
len ratingfive It allows our services and meetings to continue with clear communication to all 
len ratingfive I highly recommend the drive whether you run or are involved in a business church home or school google drive has EVERYTHING you need to orchestrate and organize technical your life 
len ratingfive It s honestly one of the most helpful apps when it comes to organization 
len ratingfive I have been using google drive for many years almost years 
len ratingfive I was frustrated that I have to sign out of one gmail drive account and log in into another gmail drive account 
len ratingfive It s all great now because I can use them simultaneously 
len ratingfour I absolutely love this app but I wish I could listen the MPs I have uploaded at and speeds like I can with my podcast app 
len ratingfour That s the one thing this app is missing in my opinion 
len ratingone Now they re even censoring bad reviews 
len ratingone I submitted a Star review for the lack of details in the update release notes and there is no sign of my review 
len ratingone I m very upset with the fact that weeks worth of work docs were not saved after the creator of our shared files updated google drive 
len ratingone I don t feel this is a reliable place to keep anything here from this point forward 
len ratingone I sent an email to a colleague and the file appended was too large so gmail automatically used google drive 
len ratingone No dialogue 
len ratingone Just sent it 
len ratingone Great 
len ratingone Later the recipient is told he does not have permission 
len ratingone I am sent an email in which it says that my colleague has asked for permission 
len ratingone It has a link that says click here to provide permission 
len ratingone It takes me to the video that I tried to share 
len ratingone Nowhere on that page does it show permissions and when I click on information about the file it shows that the general public has permission to view it so there are no permissions to give 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingone I m sure I did not ever click anything that caused Gmail to secure the attachment so that recipient would need to ask for permission 
len ratingone Seems like a bug 
len ratingone Some of my folders are empty 
len ratingone I can only find some files in other folders
len ratingfive Awesome app
len ratingfive Makes saving and accessing files anywhere so easy
len ratingfive Iv e been trying to play all games but it didn t work but it does with this app great application 
len ratingone  Just mentioning bug fixes and improvements in update notes will not work 
len ratingone Please provide details of what has changed 
len ratingone If this behavior does not change I will uninstall and stop using Google Drive completely 
len ratingfive I use this for work school and recreation 
len ratingfive It s great to be able to have all of my files in one place across computers as I have many I use daily 
len ratingfive The team drive feature is also awesome for sharing documents related to work projects where we can all view and edit in the same place and not get important items lost in emails 
len ratingfive The ability to be able to save space on my computers is also a huge plus 
len ratingfive I stored all my files on G Drive and every time I forget to bring my laptop or if my laptop breaks I don t have to worry about losing them anymore 
len ratingfive It s accompanying software on Mac and PC also makes it feel like a natural part of my laptop than a separate cloud based storage where I have to constantly back up my files to 
len ratingtwo I uploaded all my videos to google drive and they deleted all almost all of them 
len ratingtwo Lucky I had backed all the videos on an external drive 
len ratingtwo All my videos were there after the upload but when I went back and checked it a week later of my videos had been deleted but it wasn t in the trash bin I couldn t find them anywhere 
len ratingfive it s good
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingtwo  and more storage for free as well but no ability to password protect the app or even a single folder within the app means that I m searching for something else 
len ratingfive ME gusta mucho porque puedo guardar mi canciones
len ratingfive Love Google Drive
len ratingone This app used to display Unicode txt files Ok but recent updates messed up the Unicode support and now my Japanese and Chinese documents show rubbish 
len ratingfive I used Microsoft OneDrive for the past years 
len ratingfive Microsoft is awful always crashing constant sync issues and lost files 
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive for the past year and have never had a single issue not one 
len ratingfive Google Drive is top notch awesome easy to use and reliable 
len ratingone Tries to take over hard to sideload books etc becoming useless
len ratingfive I used KeepSafe as a photo storage app until December but when my iPod Touch died I lost almost everything 
len ratingfive Priceless pictures that couldn t be replaced 
len ratingfive Drive is very reliable I love it and I will always use it 
len ratingfive  GB free storage is more than enough 
len ratingfive Would definitely recommend 
len ratingfive I use my Google drive daily easy to use understand 
len ratingfive I highly recommend you give IT a try 
len ratingfive Greg Raymond CEO CXOGLOBAL Global IT Staffing l CXO Search l Advisory

len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingfive I love having total access to my docs photos etc 
len ratingfive stored here on ALL of my devices 
len ratingfive Does what I need it to do
len ratingthree Recent update has removed the option to zoom out when viewing a spreadsheet 
len ratingthree Please address with the return of the zoom out feature 
len ratingone How can this app be so bad at displaying spreadsheets 
len ratingone I understand supporting complex features can be difficult but showing just a grid of numbers should not be that hard 
len ratingone Is it 
len ratingone I don t even expect it to show the graphs which by the way it fails to show but at least show me the numbers 
len ratingone Sigh 
len ratingfour My drive is great for keeping documents and make reading them easy 
len ratingfive We use Google Drive as our shared drive in lieu of a true connected network 
len ratingfive The tools get better with every update 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingone Not user friendly for normal file management via mobile
len ratingfive  all right 
len ratingfive I use this suite for literally every area of my life 
len ratingfive Can t tell you how amazing this is for me as an individual and even more so as a brand

len ratingfive pierre sisters
len ratingone Very slow load time 
len ratingone I end up with three duplicates or the file I uploaded never arrives 
len ratingone It s stupid and I ve had at least a dozen updates all failures as far as a reliable drive for my iPhone with limited storage 
len ratingone I suggest at least true for iPhone users to stay clear of the Google Drive 
len ratingone  very disappointed
len ratingfive It is very convenient to use google drive for every storage and portability need 
len ratingfive good
len ratingfive I honestly love google docs 
len ratingfive Especially for group projects and note taking 
len ratingfive I wish I knew about google docs during my undergrad but it has been one of the best tools for my graduate program 
len ratingfour Please bring back drag and drop 
len ratingfour Many folders I manage are many folders within a directory and moving files takes times longer 
len ratingfour Please add playback speed feature for videos and I will happily change the rating to stars 
len ratingfive The fact that google drive lets us share documents with each other is fairly incredible 
len ratingfive It is very impressive that documents and presentations could save automatically 
len ratingfive This makes communication way easier and way efficient 
len ratingfive Google Drive has its own big brain to make anything possible 
len ratingfive Very important and helpful
len ratingthree Love most of the Google Apps for iPad 
len ratingthree Wish they would incorporate digital writing and drawing with the Apple Pencil though 
len ratingfour I love the app for its convenience when on the go but I wish I didn t have to swap between Docs and the web when needing to check definitions or find alternative words for variation 
len ratingfour It d be nice if I could just access the device of choice s internal dictionaries 
len ratingfour I also wish I could figure out how to create an indent but I m not sure if the app lacks that function or if it s just eluded me 
len ratingfour Overall it s great and super useful but I wouldn t mind seeing a few tweaks made 
len ratingfive Google is expanding the way people can comment on Google Drive files 
len ratingfive Users can now make comments right from previews inside Drive as opposed to having to open them in Google Docs Sheets or Slides 
len ratingfive Girl I luv dis app
len ratingfive I ve loved Google Drive since the first time I used it 
len ratingfive Drive makes it so easy to share files and have access to important files wherever I am 
len ratingfive I can start working on something copy it to Google Drive and pick up working on the file later whether I m using my computer my iPad or my iPhone 
len ratingfive Want to finish working on a file when I get home 
len ratingfive Copy it to Drive and it s waiting there for me I can make my edits save it back to Drive and it will be waiting for me when I get back to work in the morning 
len ratingfive And so much more so many other tricks I can do now through the magic of Google Drive 
len ratingone It worked great when I first downloaded it on my iPhone 
len ratingone However more recently when I open a document to view it it crashes and closes the app 
len ratingone I ve tried deleting and re downloading the app but it doesn t fix the problem 
len ratingone Really disappointing since I use google drive for everything 
len ratingone Now I can t view any of my documents on my phone when I don t have access to a computer 
len ratingone Use to work fine now it freezes every time I try uploading pictures iPhone X 
len ratingfive This Is A Very Great App Everything Is Great I Can Drag Files And Other Uses 
len ratingfive This Is Also A Great School Source 
len ratingfour I added Drive to all my tablets and phones just for the convenience of being able to share across devices 
len ratingfour It does what I need it to do without a lot stuff that I don t want or need 
len ratingfive My Drive is Your Drive
len ratingfive Relied on Drive for many years with out failure 
len ratingfive Recommend to every one 
len ratingfive Good and convenient place to store everything 
len ratingthree  I love this app I rely on this app better than any other app out there the only problem for me is when I upload any file big or small to my drive it only uploads when my screen is awake but if it goes to sleep or I shut the screen off the file fails to upload On Android you can have the phone with the screen off and it will still upload in the background please fix this don t like wasting battery by keeping the phone awake 
len ratingfive S per buena
len ratingone  When dealing with search results if you tap a folder there is no way to navigate up or even know where that folder is in your entire directory structure 
len ratingone To be clear I m only talking about search results for example you type in you search for pictures then tap a folder name in the search results there is no way to tell where you re at in your entire folder structure 
len ratingone There is no way to navigate to the parent folder ie the equivalent of the Linux command CD or clicking the up arrow in windows explorer Search is the entire point of Google drive and part of its core functionality thus I don t understand why on the iOS app search and folder navigation of your search results is so poor and lacking 
len ratingone If you have two folders named pictures spread out through your entire folder structure there is no way to know which one is where once you have tapped it 
len ratingfive Google continues to drive to lead new helpful innovations that help students the working class and everyday usage for people 
len ratingfive  Drive is a system that helps get things done with ease but could become more advanced by helping to convert material to certain formats as Word doc 
len ratingfive or Power Point with sending images to material to different email services such as yahoo 
len ratingfive  This is the best app I have ever used for any type of project 
len ratingfive For school this is the only app I will ever use for school projects or anything else worth printing 
len ratingfive I prefer this over any other alternative to store personal pictures or documents 
len ratingfive I have a million power points saved pictures word documents and voice recordings 
len ratingfive So far I have not had an issue despite the quantity of files stored 
len ratingfive Totally recommend
len ratingfive These videos are incredible
len ratingthree STILL Have to start from root directory every time to add a file to an email and can t select multiple files when attaching 
len ratingone Try emailing yourself a formatted document or one with tables 
len ratingone It won t look the same on another pc iPad or iPhone 
len ratingone Nice try tho 
len ratingfive E and my family love google drive 
len ratingone  I enjoy the constant exiting and now it says link I entered in the text is wrong when it s correct 
len ratingone When I click on files it constantly freezes up 
len ratingfive I can t imagine my personal or professional life without Google Drive 
len ratingthree I absolutely LOVE Google Drive 
len ratingthree I am able to have all my documents in one place and on the go 
len ratingthree The reason why I give it a stars is because when uploading multiple images to create it as file is great on the Android App but not for Apple 
len ratingthree Please make it available for iPhone Google Drive App 
len ratingfive Easy to use and it s a GREAT business tool 
len ratingfive THANK YOU GOOGLE 
len ratingone Where do these things go 
len ratingone I save a picture pdf or scan to a folder and when I go to send to someone it can t be located 
len ratingone Sometimes I can go to recent and find it but it s rarely in the folder 
len ratingone Or in the picture file anywhere 
len ratingone I use Google Drive for my photography so I can easily share my photos to clients or upload files for school 
len ratingone But recently it won t connect at all nor will it let me even view my documents 
len ratingone It says I do not have any documents 
len ratingone I can t even log out of my accounts 
len ratingone I ve tried uninstalling reinstalling restarting my device and even my drive on Google Chrome is all funky on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Its Really great 
len ratingfive I really enjoy by using this 
len ratingfive Having the Google Drive app on my phone has made my life as a teacher so easy 
len ratingfive I have all my work and school docs at my fingertips at all times 
len ratingfive I like it because you can do docs sheets and slides all in one app so you don t have to get them in separate apps 
len ratingfour It s pretty good saves a lot of time and storage but there are some problems 
len ratingfour I don t like how when I try to open my videos in IMovie I press open in And I get a notification that says file cannot be open I just wanna know if you can update that so I can open my video in multiple applications
len ratingfour I often have a hard time finding my files and folders on google drive 
len ratingfour There s something unintuitive about it I can t figure it out 
len ratingfive I love google drive it s 
len ratingone This app isn t good
len ratingfive Dear Google drive company I love typing things but except in my book I can t figure out how to get the highlighter off of the document 
len ratingfive Sincerely Dana S Little Coronado middle school 
len ratingfive Great organizer and identifier 
len ratingfive Images perfectly rendered and saved 
len ratingfive No one does things like Google 
len ratingfour  Please please please bring me the passcode system as it was before 
len ratingfour I need it badly 
len ratingfour Please 
len ratingone Uploading photos from my iPhone to google drive says it worked but none of my other devices can see the photos or download them 
len ratingone Do I need to go to iCloud 
len ratingone Frustrated 
len ratingfive In addition to my most priced recipes I have saved on Drive hundreds of old digitally scanned family letters dating back to and I am sharing them with relatives 
len ratingfive Drive is a joy to me 
len ratingthree Ok but to many click not intuitive 
len ratingthree It s fine for the average joe 
len ratingfive Everything I have worked on on my laptop is right there on my phone 
len ratingfive I don t carry my laptop everywhere but I do carry my phone 
len ratingfour Would be easier to save to camera roll
len ratingone There are files that aren t readily shown taking up space on my drive and trying to delete them a few at a time is a pain 
len ratingone Was easier to do on iPad than computer which is just ridiculous
len ratingone Unreliable with my most important content
len ratingfive  infotainment 
len ratingtwo Even using key words for title search does not result in finding documents
len ratingfive Google drive impresses me because has the features implemented before I want them 
len ratingfive Fab 
len ratingfive Ubiquitous 
len ratingfive An excellent resource 
len ratingfive tcb 
len ratingthree It always crashes on me no matter what version of the app or version of IOS 
len ratingfive Super 
len ratingfive Great coordination by the team 
len ratingfive Love the organization this app provides 
len ratingfive Great download
len ratingfive This version of drive works very well 
len ratingfive It is very simplistic and allows you to easily access your drive on the go 
len ratingfive gymo meh
len ratingfive And efficient
len ratingfour There doesn t need seem to be enough space on this drive it starts overlapping documents in you can no longer find what you re looking for 
len ratingone Go ahead use it for a week 
len ratingone This is pathetic 
len ratingone I don t even bother 
len ratingone The only way to find a document is to type the name into the search box 
len ratingone Navigating a tree of new folders is impossible because it does not update the list and it does not update the files either so changes in a folder are not shown in the app even days later 
len ratingone The app does not suggest that it is updating the list of a particular folder and refreshing a folder does not refresh the list 
len ratingfour Instead of clicking an opening each one then hitting delete I would like to be able to click multiple without opening and delete 
len ratingfour Please bring back password lock option
len ratingtwo Thanks for the drive 
len ratingtwo However It should be able to upload when I click out of the app instead it hangs and fails 
len ratingone One drive has password and Touch ID protection for files documents photos why not have google drive 
len ratingone I really wondered 
len ratingone I have a lot of files in my google drive but have no protection 
len ratingone This is crazy please add password protection 
len ratingone One star for now if I see password protection I ll update my review 
len ratingfive G Suite has revolutionized education 
len ratingfive Absolutely love 
len ratingfive I have used G drive for at least years or so and it seems to work good 
len ratingfive I just need to learn a little more about it by using it and navigating through it 
len ratingfour i dont like that you can only type on drive with a laptop other than that its fine
len ratingfive I love the google drive app 
len ratingfive It s fast intuitive and gets the job done 
len ratingfive You can now share a bit of your story with a reader 
len ratingthree Ive tried every way possible I know to upload a bunch of pictures from a recent trip to google drive from iPhone photos and the ONLY way that is working albeit at the speed literally of dial up is to physically connect my phone to chromebook copy them into GDrive that way 
len ratingthree Common 
len ratingthree st century this is unacceptable 
len ratingfour Hi
len ratingfive I absolutely love this program it does the job exquisitely and I am very pleased 
len ratingfive Thank You Bravo
len ratingfive It makes life easier 
len ratingfour Previously we were able to protect login with password 
len ratingfour Why is this function disabled 
len ratingfour This is a must for drives in Mobile 
len ratingfour Please incorporate soon 
len ratingone I don t understand the purpose of an update just to take away the passcode protection 
len ratingone That s one of the most important features
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I use this for school and personal 
len ratingfive I even got my year old mom to use it 
len ratingfive Love that work can be done even though a cell phone 
len ratingone I don t really use the Google Drive app for anything I think it s kind of stupid that all you can do is view your files and not edit them unless you have the separate docs or slides apps 
len ratingone I mostly use the app for downloading pictures and videos off of my iPad but there is a single video I have been trying to upload for about a week and it still isn t done 
len ratingone The app has just been so incredibly slow and unresponsive 
len ratingfive Useful and convenient
len ratingone Haven t watched one of the videos shared with me in days to see if the issue would subside but still persist after months 
len ratingfour Drive is really easy because you have all your stuff all organized if you do it 
len ratingone Please
len ratingfive Excelente
len ratingfive I use it for business and personal files 
len ratingfive Syncs instantly has saved me from alot of headache
len ratingone All I get is a roundabout to sign in then go to my Google account then back to Drive and repeat endlessly

len ratingfive I ve gotten way better at it over the past couple years and I absolutely LOVE it 
len ratingfive It has made it so much easier to pull up a lesson print off the needed assignments open the power points in any classroom at any time 
len ratingfive I can t say enough positive about the drive

len ratingfive Otherwise it s top notch 
len ratingfive But I m too lazy to erase the duplicates
len ratingfive  Very Helpful App 
len ratingfour Great 
len ratingfour Love Intuitive and easy way to share work on files with my team and our clients 
len ratingfour  Folders make it easy to set access write permissions

len ratingfour Cannot search for them either 
len ratingfour Have to email myself the links to view edit 
len ratingfour Then they show up in browsing search 
len ratingfour Thanks dev team 
len ratingfive Good app

len ratingfour I just wish to have access just like on desktop you can get the option to have a file viewed but not downloaded 
len ratingfour Same with commenting

len ratingfive you people out there should buy it
len ratingfour I love this I just ask can we PLEASE get a google drive player for the music so it can auto play to the next song in the playlist 
len ratingfour And also have to ability to repeat skip forward backward etc 
len ratingfour That would make this perfect 
len ratingfive Seamless between devices and can even use offline 
len ratingfive The other day I needed to create a file for my school 
len ratingfive My mom wanting to help suggested using some weird app that I only heard of once 
len ratingfive After setting me up on there I was clueless on how to do it 
len ratingfive Then I opened google docs

len ratingfive Long overdue 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive for years and couldn t imagine working without it these days
len ratingone The new update claimed to fix bugs and performance issues while minimizing crashing but my app didn t start to crash until after the update 
len ratingone Now I can t scroll past the second page of a document without it crashing making drive on my iPad useless 
len ratingone The developers need to re evaluate this version 
len ratingfive I have a place to keep everything from pictures to articles that I want to read later 
len ratingfive This is my file cabinet 
len ratingthree This is a great app and it really does everything right which is why I m surprised there are so many weird UI issues when it comes to video playback 
len ratingthree The fast forward rewind function buttons disappear when you are in landscape mode 
len ratingthree That means you have to move the tiny time bar manually and that can be very wonky especially if you have big fingers 
len ratingthree One tap during playback will bring up the title another tap will bring up the time bar and another will clear the screen 
len ratingthree It never fades away 
len ratingthree Casting a video to a television using Apple TV is out of the question 
len ratingthree The app just stalls and will only resume playback once you ve cancelled the cast 
len ratingthree These are the complaints that I as well as my students have had whenever we use this app 
len ratingthree And that stinks because it does everything else so well 
len ratingfive Awesome AF
len ratingfive  Great handy app 
len ratingfive I love drive and docs 
len ratingfive It s an app that I have used personally and now with my company I use it to share and comment on our projects 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfour Good
len ratingthree Please add fingerprint or password option while starting the app 
len ratingthree OneDrive and Dropbox already have this 
len ratingthree It increases the security of my files 
len ratingthree Kindly add it ASAP 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingfive Great program to store all your stuff 
len ratingfive New Review with my new iPhone X GB Sprint DagNabbitRabbit Even faster and easier to use 
len ratingfive Switching between accounts couldn t be easier and using all of the google family of document applications including PDF and spreadsheets couldn t be faster 
len ratingfive Loading instantly JPG images are a breeze to save load view edit delete on the fly 
len ratingfive Can t say enough about this wonderful app from Google Most Definitely DagNabbitRabbit Approved Wonderful one of the most incredibly versatile programs that one could ever ask for 
len ratingfive With Google Drive YOU have that ability to not only save and protect your images and share them if you wish BUT you may also save Google Sheets 
len ratingfive Notes and much much more 
len ratingfive This program saves your metadata from your images perfectly 
len ratingfive For those who may not be familiar with metadata date created date modified size of file location of image and in some apps such as ProCamera can actually show you from which compass point you were pointing the camera when said image was taken 
len ratingfive And this actually works 
len ratingfive All to often whence an image is copied to a program an app or another device or drive this valuable metadata is lost and you simply see date created today 
len ratingfive Even if the image was taken years ago 
len ratingfive A truly remarkable application 
len ratingfive Definitely DagNabbitRabbit Approved New Review 
len ratingfive DagNabbitRabbit Sprint iPhone X Now even better improved faster more options and the ability to mesh with more apps for even more control of your content 
len ratingfive DagNabbitRabbit Approved There is one crevate 
len ratingfive You can t save your Live Photo s from your iPhone on any app other than iCloud 
len ratingfive If you could save all the information for a Live Photo that would be Something 
len ratingfive How i can use the new update and product my files please help
len ratingfive Magnifico 
len ratingfive Everything in on place for a group 
len ratingfive It is an evolved version of the yahoo groups concept from years ago 
len ratingthree This update version is error 
len ratingthree Please update again not real update 
len ratingfive So helpful and convenient 
len ratingfive I wish all app creators made such great apps 
len ratingfive I use Drive all the time 
len ratingfive Especially helpful when collaborating on a project 
len ratingthree  For the most part I love this app 
len ratingthree A recent update made a change that I do NOT like 
len ratingthree When opening Excel files saved to the drive it now forces to page breaks 
len ratingthree In other words if you have many columns you can t just move to the right and see more columns 
len ratingthree It forces to the next page 
len ratingthree This is not a good thing to do to an excel file 
len ratingthree If it can t put say months of columns it needs to scroll 
len ratingthree I don t want Nov Dec on the next page 
len ratingthree No matter want I do I can t see say the last quarter oct dec 
len ratingthree You could scroll right on the old version 
len ratingfive It s the electronic file cabinet you always needed but never knew you did 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfour Banana

len ratingfive It is the best world 
len ratingfive Love having my google drive constantly at my fingertips 
len ratingfive It increases my productivity drastically

len ratingone Quick Access now is allowing porn girl posts to appear and when I use the menu to select remove they never go away

len ratingfive I ran across google drive and I am so excited how I can have pictures and documents at my finger tips

len ratingone Having a Difficult time managing and deleting files I do not know what is shared with my computer and what is to be deleted and if I delete a file is it permanently deleted from both my computer and my drive I do not know I have no way of figuring this out because the interface is not that clear
len ratingone  Google has yet to do anything about content sharing spam after several months of at least one every day 
len ratingone It s not like the spam is doing anything novel it could be handled with minimal effort 
len ratingone WTH Google 
len ratingone Am I going to have to ditch you as my primary cloud storage 
len ratingfive I started using it right now and it s amazing
len ratingfive App is good 
len ratingfive But you cannot secure it with password 
len ratingfive I think it is a shortcoming 
len ratingfive Drive allows me to work on my phone conveniently saving everything 
len ratingfive I can use documents and spreadsheets during meetings and casual conversations without the hassle of having my laptop with me at all times 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Love the simplicity
len ratingfive I am a teacher I need files for school home and on the go 
len ratingfive I use an iPad school laptop and school desktop in separate classrooms 
len ratingfive It was years ago when I lost my flash drive and searched for a better way to save files and have them available everywhere 
len ratingfive The solution was Google Drive 
len ratingfive I even use Google Drive on my cellphone with an excel file to keep track of my personal spending 
len ratingfive Drive holds my Resumes pdf s documents presentations and future projects I m working on 
len ratingfive It auto saves as you type so you never have to worry did I click save It does it all for you and it s free 
len ratingfive As a Realtor this app helps me keep instant access to important documents 
len ratingfive Great for school 
len ratingfive Great for any other times you would need to jot stuff down on your computer 
len ratingfive I would recommend this to any school debating on weather or not to use this 
len ratingfive Also for any others 
len ratingfive You could use this for work or for just yourself 
len ratingfive I m a business consultant 
len ratingfive I am not always at my computer or near my iPad 
len ratingfive But the accessibility of the Drive allow me to simply send contracts info flyers receipts etc effortlessly on time 
len ratingfive Plus you can edits files from your Drive 
len ratingfive There are no excuses 
len ratingfive Download it upload your files and USE IT 
len ratingfour Just one feature that I care about is missing scan which saves as pdf 
len ratingfour Excellent way to store files anywhere 
len ratingfour Sharing features are great allowing for collaboration between multiple contributors 
len ratingfour Making folders and documents is a breeze 
len ratingfour Would definitely like to see more tools for sorting at a glance and instant copy paste from one folder to another 
len ratingone I cannot see a lot of the folders that I have on Google Drive while using this app 
len ratingone Why can t you set a password to access your files
len ratingthree I purchased the package of more storage several months ago 
len ratingthree I still have yet to get my storage increase 
len ratingthree I have emailed you several times with no response 
len ratingthree Fix this
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive If you don t have it yet What are you waiting for 
len ratingone I m not sure if it s the integration with Apple but it s difficult to maneuver between full views of the file and back to the listing of files within a folder 
len ratingone It is not easy to download files to my phone either 
len ratingone Your desktop version of drive s search feature is also difficult to use and seldom gives me results I m looking for
len ratingfour This Google app is very useful but there are things that I d like to see incorporated 
len ratingfour  Brief tutorial giving users a simple and quick nuts and bolts of how to navigate and use the app 
len ratingfour  Discussion regarding the differences on saving files in web based apps versus non web based apps 
len ratingfour  Better editing capabilities change fonts more layout choices less rigid formatting options etc 
len ratingfour  More detailed explanation about how to insert graphics and photo s
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone No slide show option 
len ratingone I have hundreds of photos yet I can t even play the slideshow with this app 
len ratingone It is crazy that I have to scroll one by one through each picture when it would just be great to play a slideshow on my TV throughout the day and not have to worry about scrolling picture by picture with my finger 
len ratingthree First time using IOS and can t find team drive does it have team drive feature in IOS 
len ratingfive I have google everything and I wouldn t pick anything else ever
len ratingfive Google drive is an app that is amazing
len ratingfive Very happy with this app 
len ratingfive It is always Functional and dependable 
len ratingfive Google Drive is just an awesome app giving the student musician or small business access to documents anytime anywhere from a cell phone integrate with any computer or printer you choose

len ratingfive  thanks
len ratingfive Like how easy but to new to comment 
len ratingfive Working remotely and sharing so much content between the team has become seamless thanks to drive
len ratingfive Just download 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive There is not much I have to say about google as we know about its authenticity and the services it s been offering since a long time 
len ratingfive I was using drive since its inception and the drive app since I bought a smart phone 
len ratingfive It had a continuum in updating itself and it is doing a pretty good job in doing it now consistently 
len ratingfive It has never been hard to use the drive app as per the learning that I have had where I had to use it directly on the application webpage or on a different website where it works with its rd party support API they have done a wonderful job in making it work seamlessly 
len ratingfive I only had issue ONCE in all these years while using the drive from a third party website 
len ratingfive It is a privilege for me to thank Google for offering its services at free of cost since all these years in the form of this review 
len ratingfive With best regards and thankfulness Phani Gardas
len ratingfive From my dissertation to health and insurance documents Google Drive lets me access everything I need no matter where I am or what devices are available to use 
len ratingfive I m using google drive to store my cooking recipes and do business forms and it works great 
len ratingfive I can access it anywhere and on any device 
len ratingfive Awesome to work offline with important reports or even draft my blogpost while in the flight 
len ratingfive No problem so far 
len ratingfive Better than peanut butter and jelly 
len ratingone Why is it so ungodly difficult to download a photo from the G Drive app into your camera roll on iOS 
len ratingfive I just set my home router and add the printer with the new set up I m able to print the document from my google drive to my printer 
len ratingfive Great experience 
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfive Reliable and fast 
len ratingfive I m thrilled with this app 
len ratingfive Simply the best
len ratingfive I use drive to store share collaborate and organize both personal and professional files 
len ratingfive It is a truly amazing tool 
len ratingfive It s my digital photographic memory

len ratingfive Such an amazing app 
len ratingfive It s wonderful to use 
len ratingfive I have went to sought documents from years ago 
len ratingfive I m hoping I can retrieve my old Resume because I have a new email 
len ratingfive Easy access of all sorts of drawings pictures documents
len ratingfive I literally have created two business and nearly everything I conduct operations under are completed some form of the Google Drive 
len ratingfive I could not recommend this more if you get to know the intricacies of the functionality 
len ratingfive Consistently works and I feel confident recommending it to my friends
len ratingfour Great app would like to see chromecast support
len ratingfive I would rather use slides
len ratingone  If the data is in the cloud why is so much data being used on my devices 
len ratingone There shouldn t be any Documents Data on the device but there is a substantial amount 
len ratingone The app deserves star until this is fixed 
len ratingfive This is an absolute wonderful way to make spreadsheet to keep all the data for a group that I admin 
len ratingfive It s a valuable tool 
len ratingfive better
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Massive storage 
len ratingfive Everything in one place 
len ratingfive Goodbye flash drives external drives cluttered hard drives

len ratingfive Love my google drive 
len ratingfive Easy to use even with multiple accounts for school work 
len ratingfive See title
len ratingfive I love putting my music on this app 
len ratingone Even the IT people at school had a very difficult time working with this when I had become frustrated with navigation 
len ratingone Help was not helpful you need to make it more user friendly 
len ratingone Not all people have the computer skills that your people are assuming they do 
len ratingone When trained IT personnel have difficulty at the college level somehow you have failed George Key
len ratingfive It s nice 
len ratingtwo I love this app but do not like this latest update 
len ratingtwo I don t have immediate access to see all the pages in a spreadsheet 
len ratingfive I don t use it a lot but when I need it it s usually fine 
len ratingfive Occasionally there s a glitch but I think it s usually when I m behind on an update 
len ratingfive I usually use Drive on the PC enjoy its ease of use 
len ratingfive I like having it available on my phone for convenience when needed also 
len ratingfive Google Drive is always backing up my photos and videos 
len ratingfive I don t have to worry about it or think about it 
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingfive Give it a try I m sure you would like it too 
len ratingfive I absolutely unequivocally love G D 
len ratingfive I do pay for additional space for my ridiculous amounts of files but it doesn t cost me a lot 
len ratingfive In fact my drive space surpasses all of the other storage locations that I have access to for the simple fact that I can access all of my files from any device that I might be using 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app to all 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  It very good overall plus integration with other Google apps and services plus recently I ve got gb for free as early adopter or something like that so now I have gb without paying a cent 
len ratingfive I love Google drive because I can easily upload and download all the files I need a two day weather I am at home on the road or on location at my clients sites 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Never worry about losing a file again 
len ratingone After recent update the app crashes when I go to open anything 
len ratingfive Like how easy it is to save stuff 
len ratingfour The combo of apple being Inscrutable google imperial begs for a mess 
len ratingfour But in spite of the total and complete discard of a mere user these advertisers have an app the almost defines it s functions provides help and works reasonably well 
len ratingfour There are things all icloud databases should do like the ability to upload any type of data object e g iOS notes in bulk from my idevice to gdrive and gdrive to icloud which is unmitigated mess 
len ratingfive Love
len ratingfive One of the best app to for business and personal
len ratingfive  This is an awsome place just fix the lag on iPad please
len ratingfive From booking the experience to the end was very professional exciting and informative 
len ratingfive Adam was the gentleman that I spoke with outside our hotel who provided great information on the experience 
len ratingfive He made sure to be available for any questions 
len ratingfive Great rep for their company 
len ratingfive Once at the track they prepare you for what to expect and what they expect to make sure your experience is the best 
len ratingfive I had a great time drove the F F with Hayden as my instructor 
len ratingfive Hayden was extremely polite and professional 
len ratingfive Let the instructor know what you re looking to accomplish on the track so he can cater to you re interest for the most fun 
len ratingfive What an awesome experience 
len ratingfive If you re looking to get the thrill of racing an exotic car this is the company to do it through

len ratingtwo Please update again 
len ratingfive Easy to carry paper documents
len ratingfive I run my consulting company using Driven indispensable tool 
len ratingfive Excelente
len ratingfive  Super easy to use
len ratingfive really like it
len ratingfive I love using this app for pics docs and excel 
len ratingfive It s an excellent tool and it just works 
len ratingtwo So far it is the closest thing to a file system Apple will let you have on iOS 
len ratingtwo But obviously still can t meet all basic needs 
len ratingtwo  Normally one of my favorite apps but lately it seems like Google is trying to force their own video player to over power the native iOS video player and they block the picture in picture button and when it does work when you take it back to full screen it inexplicable restarts the video from the beginning 
len ratingone After the recent updates I can t seem to open anything 
len ratingtwo I cannot figure out how to rename docs as well as place in a specific order 
len ratingtwo Also when I shared the whole folder in the drive via email only one of the attachments showed up 
len ratingfive First let me say that I was reluctant to start moving recipes online because all the ideas I read about sounded complicated and only worked for recipes but I read about using Google drive for recipes I was intrigued because you can do searches and if you save the recipes as google documents you can save changes you make in the recipes 
len ratingfive I created a recipe folder and love it 
len ratingfive I have also started using the drive for some photos and other items I want to save 
len ratingfive With Google being so popular I think this may be a great long term solution for a host of things for me 
len ratingfive Also even if you are not super techy you can do this 
len ratingfive I m not 
len ratingfive I use drive for everything and I don t have to log into a computer to see or send anything 
len ratingfive Really good for organizing files along with dropbox
len ratingthree I thought that it was very difficult to get My Drive to sync w Chrome for easy DL and attachment of files through gmail while using the apps on my tablet 
len ratingthree If there is some setting or work around that I missed please let me know 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Easy to use and never have any problems with it
len ratingfive Invaluable tool for collaborative projects 
len ratingfive I use it for personal items shared family items and work 
len ratingfive Great flexible tool that lets me have documents handy wherever I am 
len ratingone Now can t send songs during Messenger chat like I used to through this app 
len ratingone Not a bug it s a new feature 
len ratingone Not cool 
len ratingfive Glad they made it an app for easy access 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Good but difecult
len ratingtwo Where is my shared folder 
len ratingone It s Slow 
len ratingfive I just love the flexibility and portability 
len ratingfive  Stars 
len ratingfive It allows me to access all my information on the go 
len ratingfive After watching Mr 
len ratingfive Robot I wonder how much they peruse through my info as well but I guess it the price we pay for convenience 
len ratingfive The best
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It s so easy to use and share documents 
len ratingfive It works Easy sorting files Easy retrieval Easy layout options Fast open and search Functionality is easy to understand Funciona Archivos de clasificaci n f ciles Recuperaci n f cil Opciones de dise o f cil R pido abrir y buscar La funcionalidad es f cil de entender Li travay Fasil klasman dosye Fasil Rekipere Layout fasil opsyon Vit louvri ak rech ch Fonksyonalite se fasil pou konprann

len ratingfive Love love love google drive and everything googly 
len ratingfive I just love the product and have always been happy using the Drive Maps and email 
len ratingfive I also love the google doodles fun stuff
len ratingfive It s so cool
len ratingfour While some of the apps can be glitchy at times this platform of apps and data sharing is transforming education private and public institutions 
len ratingfour My church group is better able to minister with the ability to quickly and efficiently keep us all on the same story with shared document sets 
len ratingfour Awesome 
len ratingfour My children all collaborate on homework assignments with the Google platform 
len ratingfour Awesome 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Thanks Team Google 
len ratingfive I ve used google drive for a while with one email address but have since activated more accounts to keep certain files separated 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and I likely don t use all of the features 
len ratingfive It s been the most helpful in organizing my hobby related stuff where before I would save some stuff on my computer and other things on an external drive but often forget to save in both places 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It seems easy enough to use and I like it 
len ratingfive I do wish however gave you options to jump between your different Gmail accounts 
len ratingfive It doesn t seem very smooth me 
len ratingfive Great storage app
len ratingfive I ve used Drive for years 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive Incredibly useful 
len ratingfive Love this App Service
len ratingfive Easiest app that I have used for PDFs and you can actually get to them without an act of congress I love the color coded files in case I don t want to label them
len ratingfive My files are there always no matter which device I am on love it
len ratingfive I have several databases in the drive and when I am asked a question I can frequently go to the drive on my iPhone and give an accurate response 
len ratingfour The app retains file names created from your iPhone as long as you upload from within Google Drive but somehow doesn t if you uploaded from outside the app itself which can be frustrating 
len ratingfour Also when uploading photos from camera roll the order of photos when viewing photos to select is reversed is confusing at times 
len ratingfour Overall the app is great and I enjoy it 
len ratingfive Love how I can sign in and upload documents
len ratingfive It is such a cool software google 
len ratingfive Thank you very much google
len ratingfive I have been using Google drive for a while now and works flawlessly across all my devices including iOS macOS Windows and android 
len ratingfive It is so nice to have a service that you can actually trust and depend on for mission critical business and private life 
len ratingfive It is also the platform of choice for my kids and their homework and assignments 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Must be user error 
len ratingfive The first thing I uploaded was Mb 
len ratingfive It took it no problem 
len ratingfive I ve shared it edited it and shared it again 
len ratingfive I just signed into it on my iPhone everything is there so I added pics from my phone 
len ratingfive No probs so far 
len ratingfive nd review Still no problems 
len ratingfive I haven t used it a whole bunch but haven t had any trouble yet 
len ratingfive rd review 
len ratingfive I ve been sharing folders with individuals and haven t had problem yet 
len ratingfive The bad review was either fixed before I read it or definitely user error 
len ratingfive Very efficient
len ratingfour App itself is ok if you only work online 
len ratingfour But if you try to work offline using the files app it doesn t work 
len ratingfour It also doesn t support multiple users for files on iOS 
len ratingfive Very convenient 
len ratingone I don t get it 
len ratingone I can t find anything relevant 
len ratingfive i use google drive to send concert pictures and videos to a bunch of people at once and it makes it so easy highly recommend 
len ratingfive Wouldn t want to have to replace Drive with anything elase

len ratingfive I use drive so much
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive Great way to have information at your fingertips wherever you are 
len ratingthree  Would be great if i can do some highlight and drawing on pdf file

len ratingfive The best cloud ever 
len ratingfive Good job Google 
len ratingfive As always 
len ratingfive  Wonderful thanks and God bless 
len ratingone I downloaded drive to use spreadsheets and slides and all that right 
len ratingone But to use spreadsheets I have to download the app

len ratingone If I had to download sheets to use sheets and docs to use docs and slides to use slides why did I even download drive 
len ratingone The app prompted me to provide a review while I was literally in the middle of doing something 
len ratingone I clicked the create folder button and instead of doing that the app decided to prompt me for a review 
len ratingone I don t care how good your app is but asking for review in such a disruptive way is a terrible user experience

len ratingfour The program could be a little more creative in layout and design but overall is well organized easy to locate hard to find files 
len ratingthree I recommend Drive to anyone that has any type of file they want to keep 
len ratingthree With how often tech breaks storing it in the cloud is really the only way to keep it from being lost 
len ratingthree That being said the app on mobile and tablet is just unreliable 
len ratingthree Maybe I have too many files but often image thumbnails just won t load 
len ratingthree Leaving me staring at image icons with no idea what they actually are 
len ratingthree Even if I click they just don t load 
len ratingthree I don t have old tech and no matter how many different iPhones or IPads I try it on the issues remain consistent even across multiple Google accounts 
len ratingthree I ve deleted the app reinstalled but nothing works 
len ratingthree I m sure they ll fix it someday but it s been years and the issue still isn t resolved 
len ratingfive Had to get with Google Drive due to faiure loss of my external hard drive so I m still trying to figure out exactly where all of my files are but I have retrieved some priceless family photos as well as some equally important family videos that I thought were lost forever

len ratingfive Good

len ratingthree I listen to music on Google Drive 
len ratingthree It would be nice if it had a play all or repeat feature so that I could play all files automatically one after the other or have a file automatically repeat 
len ratingthree It s a little annoying to have to click on a file each time in order to keep playing 
len ratingfive I found more documents that I couldn t delete from my apple I downloaded this drive which is most likely one I used on an old computer and this drive got every one and deleted it in two seconds

len ratingtwo I can t upload any photos or documents to google drive on my iPhone
len ratingfive To move docs between phone and comp 
len ratingfive Available offline option also super useful abroad 
len ratingfive Love love love google drive
len ratingfive Having the drive connected to email solves many problems and saves time because it s easy to access on any device 
len ratingfive Galing
len ratingfive R t h u ch
len ratingfive Super quick accessible on any phone tons of features that make it useful for me to share my photos with my clients as well as a backup solution 
len ratingfive In most document hubs it is very confusing but in Drive it is very easy to navigate after using it for a short time to get familiar with 
len ratingfive I love it but I think you should be able to switch drive docs into docs or sheets or etc 
len ratingfive But overall it is great 
len ratingfive Very very very convenient 
len ratingfive It is awesome 
len ratingtwo Takes hell lot of time to complete upload my pics and videos 
len ratingtwo No status bar or something to check the progress 
len ratingfive Does what it s supposed to 
len ratingfive I absolutely love good drive 
len ratingfive Google Drive is amazing and works as advertised
len ratingone It is not friendly user
len ratingone It s annoying having to download each format separately documents spreadsheets presentations in order to be able to edit a file from your phone or ipad 
len ratingone Specially because we already downloaded the Google Drive App 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive The only thing missing is a loop button
len ratingtwo Need to work on this being mobile friendly 
len ratingtwo Can not view items without the specific google app for that file 
len ratingtwo Ex 
len ratingtwo Can t view a sheet unless you have the sheets app even then it s hard to scroll 
len ratingfive I ve not had any problems accessing my data on any device 
len ratingfive It works enough said 
len ratingone For some reason it never opens the folder I click on
len ratingfive Like that it goes between devices and easy to use 
len ratingfive This app is helping eliminate before I delegate 
len ratingfive Thank google engineers for engineering 
len ratingfive I love how simple and easy google drive is to use and you can pretty much do anything on it 
len ratingfive The only issue I have is google taking over the world and my using it for everything 
len ratingfive Don t sell all my information please google
len ratingfour It s a great app just miss the feature where you can force touch on a file image while in selection 
len ratingfour It helped a lot when you have a lot of similar photos and are looking for a specific one instead of hoping you pick the right one through the thumbnail 
len ratingone Compared to Dropbox this is not intuitive
len ratingfive This app is so reliable that there s no need for network attached storage at home or work anymore 
len ratingfive I m hoping they increase the free GB storage limit someday 
len ratingfive I am a new user of Google drive but my grad class uses it exclusively so I learned to use it and am really enjoying analyzing data and making graphs 
len ratingfive Easy to use very convenient uploading very easy and fast 
len ratingfive We can share only a folder or file to friends which is great love it 
len ratingfive Will keep using it 
len ratingfive Very friendly and versatile app for the SME executive 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfour Google is awesome I always recommended because it has so many benefits like for example gives you GB for summer free no extra cause except if you want more also it saves your photos from your phone to google photos not only that but also it has a program similar to Microsoft but it s not which is called google docs excel PowerPoint and spread sheets every time your working on your document it automatically saves your what your typing so you don t have to worry if the internet went out n it didn t save don t worry google got your back not only it backs up your document every second but also you can share it with other people the documents you create and keeps track of what everyone is doing in the document and also theirs a shareable link that u can send to everyone without making an effort then signing into their google or if they don t have google account it is awesome and then when you start typing an assignment in Spanish it corrects your Spanish or any language you are typing
len ratingfive Does what it s suppose to
len ratingfive One of the best products for file storage
len ratingfour This is a great program for back up and offsite purposes 
len ratingfive I am a beginner in paid photography mostly portrait and i use google drive to share images with clients easily 
len ratingfive I use this for every event and sharing with family and friends is easy 
len ratingfive I work in a maintenance department for a plastics company and we have thousands of machine manuals electrical wiring diagrams machine layouts etc on bookshelf s that over time become unorganized and just a mess 
len ratingfive By the whole department using Google Drive each and every mechanic has all the machine manuals and electrical diagrams on their phone and best of all it s cloud based so it doesn t use storage on anyone s device 
len ratingfive  stars 
len ratingfive Instant access and smooth interface
len ratingfive Excellent for Accessing Revising Tracking and Sharing
len ratingfive With great ease I have access to all my heavy documents files video clips and photographs 
len ratingfive It has made my life easy 
len ratingfive Thanks google

len ratingfour It probably can and I m just too tired or stupid to figure it out at in the morning but it d be nice if a simple way to organize files existed via mobile 
len ratingfour Otherwise the quality expected from Google

len ratingfive This is a great tool 
len ratingfive Everyone should use it

len ratingfive Best app to store your files
len ratingfive I had all of my personal files on a flash drive but have a Mac computer so I wasn t sure how compatible it would be 
len ratingfive Whenever I would open up a file it would show up and some in a different format 
len ratingfive I downloaded apps like open office etc 
len ratingfive But didn t really experiment too much with them 
len ratingfive Then I found out how I could drag and drop everything from my flash drive right into Google Drive which I ve had right along but haven t really used much 
len ratingfive It s all there 
len ratingfive On my computer at work my Mac computer at home my iPad my iPhone 
len ratingfive No more flash drives that I need to worry about being corrupted

len ratingfive Love being able to share so many things with family coworkers children friends and everyone 
len ratingfive Love this App all day
len ratingfive I have been a paid personal user as well as a Gsuite user 
len ratingfive I ve never been happier with a service 
len ratingfive Whenever there is a problem it s quick to get fixed and syncing files across my devices is seamless 
len ratingfive The only thing I wish they had not removed was the added security of the additional security code to open drive files 
len ratingfive What can I say about google drive it s just awesome 
len ratingfive Sharing storing on the cloud what else can you ask 
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfour Makes sharing of my photography pics easy 
len ratingtwo I miss the extra security of having a passcode on drive 
len ratingtwo I tend not to use it as much now for sharing files as I feel it s less secure 
len ratingone Disappointing that the passcode fingerprint lock is no longer available
len ratingfive It makes everything available from anywhere 
len ratingfive I keep documents I need and file them on my computer later 
len ratingfive It s syncs quickly and I ve been using it for years without issue 
len ratingfive I use this on the go all of the time pretty quick and easy to upload and to save especially with the automatic save tool it has built in on docs drive is a pretty great place to put things when you don t have a laptop or flash drive 
len ratingfive  recommend
len ratingfive Great app

len ratingfive Easy access to everything and aligned with all of your google apps 
len ratingthree When I select all files and I hit button make offline available nothing happens

len ratingfive Esta excelente esta app me ha servido much simo Es muy recomendable 
len ratingone To use google photos from my PC I started with the google backup sync program 
len ratingone This started the long process of uploading my photos from PC to google photo free no limit 
len ratingone However this process also created a Google drive for this account and dumped a bunch of the photos uploaded in the Google drive which is only free up to GB 
len ratingone How can I have an unlimited and free google photo if a GB limited Google Drive is attached in the process 
len ratingone I don t want a Google drive for this account 
len ratingfive Very reliable
len ratingfive  An online cloud that I can access from anywhere on any device organized into files how ever I see fit that integrates with other apps allows me to share files easily plus googles online version of Word and Excel that saves right to the Drive it s a slam dunk

len ratingfive It s amazing how convenient google drive works 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfour It took s while to get all the functions worked out on the noble iPhone device in fact seems like the functions are a bit too limited but other than that its great
len ratingfive So far my experience has been very good 
len ratingfive I am in process of converting from Dropbox to google drive and it has been pretty smooth thus far 
len ratingfive This is a full featured productivity suite 
len ratingfive When I use it from my desktop it has the horsepower and feature set to provide the tricks I want 
len ratingfive On my smartphone where I use it most of the time everything is there uncluttered and it works seamlessly with the desktop 
len ratingthree It s still works well on my plus but I m unable to access it on my IMAC computer 
len ratingthree There isn t even an app that is associated with it to download 
len ratingfive It is app have save my life on many occasions 
len ratingfive From work board meetings to court and just plane ole personal use 
len ratingfive It has been awesome so much so that I m thinking of upgrading the size of my drive due to my high usage 
len ratingfive Much better than dropbox

len ratingfive It also frees up more space so that can take more memorable photos and videos

len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive great app
len ratingone  Disappointing that the passcode fingerprint lock is no longer available
len ratingthree I hate it 
len ratingfive Works as advertised 
len ratingtwo  I uploaded several videos and pictures in my google drive through my iPhone 
len ratingtwo However when I need them again I can not save them in my galley through this app 
len ratingtwo It only works for pictures not videos 
len ratingtwo I ve used Drive for years 
len ratingtwo I liked that it was free and I could access it from all of my devices 
len ratingtwo But Drive is super clunky on my iPad and I have to work around it s default of opening every file in a google app even though I have Word PowerPoint Acrobat Reader etc already installed 
len ratingtwo And now they ve decided to end the free upgrade of G storage with not being able to use gmail as punishment for not buying the upgrade 
len ratingtwo So I will keep my Gmail by migrating my files to onedrive which integrates with my iPad windows laptop and android phone a lot better anyway 
len ratingtwo It s just annoying to have a decent app try to hold my email account hostage 
len ratingfive Unless of course you just aren t comfortable with Google s ability to gather a ton of data on you 
len ratingfive Otherwise it s a staple product function in today s connected world 
len ratingthree I love google drive and use it as my storage for everything 
len ratingthree The problem that i have with it is that on the ipad you are not able to sync everything so it can be read while offline 
len ratingthree I understand there might be technological issues with who will be the main writer for files but it would be wonderful if ipad can have automatic sync for at least read only access on all folders I dont want to have to individually click each file and make it offline 
len ratingthree Please take this into consideration googledrive team thanks

len ratingfour I like Google Drive a lot but this issue is not a great way to show how good it is 
len ratingone I was prompted to write a review right as google was telling me google script is not a supported file type on iPads 
len ratingone almost all of your apps are available on iPad but if script was also runniable on iPad I think many people would use it 
len ratingfive Must need app
len ratingfive I use it for every document I need to just have access to in an instance 
len ratingfive Google Drive is by far easier to use than One Drive or ICloud both of which I also use 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work

len ratingfive Super blessed 
len ratingfive Very handy
len ratingfive This to me is the best file application ever 
len ratingfive This is so easy to use 
len ratingfive But could you possibly add one tiny thing 
len ratingfive It s just so you can select a bunch of images and videos and download them to the photos 
len ratingfive Right now I can only do one thing at a time and that s kind of annoying 
len ratingfive Just something simply though 
len ratingfive Anyway awesome app

len ratingfive I have started using Google drive for the majority of my file storage and sharing needs 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive for its efficiency and the great sharing capabilities

len ratingfive It would be an added benefit to save documents directly to folders after downloading 
len ratingfive Currently I can only do this from GMail 
len ratingfive Thanks for all you do 
len ratingthree Please fix the built in PDF viewer 
len ratingthree It doesn t have search bookmarks and a stupid black bar keeps popping up every time when you re just trying to scroll the document 
len ratingthree Just having trouble getting used to it on a small device with limited time available 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingtwo This basic feature of most document storage apps is missing in Google Drive 
len ratingtwo Forget editing you can t even FIND a phrase in a long document 
len ratingfive All you ever need in a cloud service
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Easy to handle and it s really free 
len ratingone Company moved from Dropbox to G Suite but somehow Google doesn t think its business users need access to shared folders aka Team Drives

len ratingfive A 
len ratingfive A lot of free storage 
len ratingfive Really nice easy Interface 
len ratingfive Great for organizing files
len ratingfive I m extremely satisfied with this app 
len ratingfive It does everything that I need it to and then some 
len ratingfour Works good
len ratingone If you need to get an essay or project done then this is one of the last things I would recommend 
len ratingone You need to get multiple apps to get the same documents to open and the auto save glitches constantly 
len ratingone Don t get this unless you have to or you have no other options 
len ratingfive Very nice
len ratingfive Pros Online offline storage Interoperability Easy UI UX Cons None
len ratingone I feel as though the app is harder to navigate than on a computer 
len ratingone It takes forever to try to find something and make any administrative changes like deletions sharing etc 
len ratingfive It s a great way to move files between my iPhone and my Linux desktop 
len ratingone This is not user friendly trying to get silver light 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingfive I hope Google continues to support Develop their suite of Office software because there s still room to catch up to some of the functionality Microsoft has especially comparing XL to sheets 
len ratingfive But gDrive remains my preference 
len ratingfive Very useful for me
len ratingfive Creates a Time Saving Data connection 
len ratingfive I use my drive for my work which involves over people interacting with the same documents 
len ratingfive Google makes sharing and editing files easy 
len ratingfive I would recommend google drive for any project of any size 
len ratingfive A convenient and easy way to access files and stay organized 
len ratingfive  It s so awesome I like it soooooooo much thanyou for this wonderful app

len ratingfive Being able to store large amounts of documents and have them with me wherever I go is crucial to me and Google delivered 
len ratingfive I like the large icons and how easy it is to stay organized with this app 
len ratingone If you log into google drive on the web browser you can see your team drive 
len ratingone The web browser view of Dive tells you to use the iOS app on almost every page 
len ratingone But the iOS app does not support Team Drives 
len ratingone An update is needed 
len ratingfive Never thought I d use all the space that comes with the free account but I m running out 
len ratingfive Took me years to get here though and this was before I started using Google Photos 
len ratingfive Overall my go to file sharing service for its recognition and ease 
len ratingfive Google has combined innovation on a scale incomparable to any other company in the world 
len ratingfive Google drive has successfully combined the stuff we need and the stuff we want 
len ratingfive Google Drive started out pretty lame but now it is becoming the gold standard to compare against 
len ratingfive The synchronization works very well the UI is well thought through and of course the analytics driving the interface is spectacular 
len ratingfive Dropbox still has a few advantages but given the extent of integration Google Drive has with Gdocs it has become an indispensable app 
len ratingone I payed for the license
len ratingfive Hey this is pretty good 
len ratingone Can t figure out how to fix it 
len ratingone It doesn t update 
len ratingone It did at one time
len ratingfive Allows me to paste my life together documents spreadsheets and calendar

len ratingone The payment cleared 
len ratingone Selected to have it sync now twice 
len ratingone No change in service 
len ratingone Finally after a half day of waiting it updated but it never synced 
len ratingone I then decided to move everything over to Dropbox then I upgraded Dropbox and it upgraded and synced immediately 
len ratingone Sold 
len ratingone Goodbye 
len ratingfive We use this in school a lot 
len ratingfive As a teacher I know my students enjoy this because they write stories and directions to make up games to share with their classmates 
len ratingfive I have confidence that all my photos and videos are constantly being backed up in high res that Google has redundant data centers and DR plans 
len ratingfive I don t store anything ultra sensitive or proprietary on Drive but would would if I were a business user as well I love how it seamlessly integrates with Google Photos 
len ratingone it made me moist
len ratingfive I can view files stored in my Drive on my phone computer and tablet any time I want 
len ratingfive I travel between four store front locations and manage a team in each 
len ratingfive Google drive has been indispensable to sharing information on training sales receipts you name it between all team members and locations

len ratingfive Nothing more I can say I love it
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Perfect for when you lose your cell phone with important pictures 
len ratingthree Drive used to work very easily but now it won t work with pdf s when I m on my phone as well as the computer at all and also google drive and google pictures don t seem to talk to each other at all and it s very frustrating 
len ratingthree Also inviting someone to a album on the app is extremely hard and usually doesn t do it unless you get the link sent and press join yourself instead of getting invited
len ratingfive This is the best App I can print anything without taking out my laptop
len ratingfive Is good to work on this thank you 
len ratingfive Don t seem to not have any problems so far

len ratingfive Simple as that

len ratingfive So fast and photos are so clear 
len ratingfive Superb
len ratingfour Great app wish I could edit docs w o individually downloading other G Suite apps
len ratingfive Google drive is hands down the best thing a student can have

len ratingfive It s not any different from going on your google account online except for the fact that it s more convenient 
len ratingfive I am a student that uses a chrome book for school but you can t take pictures without waiting minutes to get all of the stuff open 
len ratingfive It s really easy to take and then send pictures right from the app 
len ratingfour Only complaints lack of space

len ratingfive Working as an IT Specialist for schools I have seen and experienced a huge advantage of not only Drive but all Google products

len ratingfive We thank Google for that 
len ratingfive Very clean and reliable 
len ratingfive Always love googe products and services 
len ratingfive Very useful and easy to maneuver through 
len ratingfive Have had many instances where it has come in very handy to gain access to important files
len ratingone This works well but I have to use it for school and it makes me sad 
len ratingone It s a good app but I m done with school and want to do what I want with my short insignificant life 
len ratingone I just want to be happy yet I keep having to go on this app and feel myself lose a sense of reality while mindlessly typing about stuff I don t even care about 
len ratingfive I found this app by mistake and I love it 
len ratingfive Great organization helps a lot in all of my classes 
len ratingfive Great backup 
len ratingfive Easily accessible

len ratingone OneDrive here we come
len ratingfour Versatile

len ratingfive I have loved all Google products and use them religiously for both school and work life 
len ratingfive I love that Docs has automatic save and that Drive is accessible from any computer 
len ratingfive I can always find my files and enjoy the user interface 
len ratingone Slow clunky buggy 
len ratingone I upload documents they disappear for min then they reappear 
len ratingone Or I move them and they don t move

len ratingfive Good one
len ratingfour I love Drive but there is problem that makes sharing projects extremely difficult 
len ratingfour When I choose to share a PDF through text on the iPhoneX Drive cannot share it

len ratingfive Excelente aplicaci n
len ratingfive It is an awesome place to sort and store all of my stuff
len ratingfive Comes thru every time easy to upload edited photos to social media
len ratingfive Smooth and Feature Rich 
len ratingfive Re Impressed each time I use it 
len ratingone It s hard to upload more than photos at the same time with iPhone 
len ratingone I can t drag select or upload whole albums 
len ratingone It just crashes when I upload at a time and that s after selecting all of them with finger taps instead of drag select and no option to upload albums 
len ratingfive If you have a business or just need space for personal usage Google drive is considerably all you need 
len ratingfive It s an easy smooth running application 
len ratingfive Everyone needs space if they plan on keeping the important things in life safe and always accessible along with being easy to share 
len ratingfive Also the quality of the music and video files are kept in Hd 
len ratingfive It s awesome all the way around 
len ratingfive Not hard to use 
len ratingfive So helpful 
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingfive I use drive and google docs everyday at work 
len ratingfive Just amazing 
len ratingfive Love Google Drive
len ratingfive I ve been trying to organize my files for a long while 
len ratingfive I m happy that I found this app It s very helpful and saves me time from searching everywhere for my things 
len ratingfive The app design is great also 
len ratingfive  I don t know how my life could be without google drive 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone This app lets you look at but not edit any of your docs 
len ratingone What s the point of that 
len ratingfive User friendly app 
len ratingfive Love love
len ratingtwo Certainly convenient and the lack of cost can t be overlooked but filing could be made easier like Microsoft s file management 
len ratingtwo The features are hard to find or discover unless you play with it a while and you must remember all the little and seemingly hidden buttons and features 
len ratingtwo The review is intended to help and I appreciate Google s constant improvements conveniences and freebies 
len ratingfive This should be written in the manual 
len ratingfive I am a designer and I always need access to my files and I m sick of searching by weird file names 
len ratingfive This is so great 
len ratingfive Thank you for doing this 
len ratingfive Syncs with my laptop all files all of the time 
len ratingone On every front from privacy to annoying phone calls to update google listing I find that this company has no ethical standards
len ratingfive I use it for pretty much anything that I need whether it s an essay for an English class or sharing photos between classmates I would be surprised if anyone has problems with google drive 
len ratingfour Will let me download photos easily on computer but it is harder on iPad
len ratingfive Love google drive 
len ratingfive Give It A Try It s You Will Love It
len ratingfive This an amazingly useful app 
len ratingfive I have no complaints 
len ratingone I didn t buy this on but they charge it 
len ratingone It is Horrible please contact me 
len ratingfive Can t beat all the free space and features Google offers for free 
len ratingfive They could charge and they would still be the best tool for the average person 
len ratingfive Google allows everyone to have all the essentials for free 
len ratingfive Best thing ever in the entire world that they could ever make
len ratingfive I works seamlessly with Google Classroom 
len ratingfive It helps a lot with projects I assign my students 
len ratingfive It s sweet 
len ratingfive Anywhere and whomever I m with I can jam my tunes or there s to me here I can listen in privacy
len ratingthree I need to be able to edit a sheet from mobile but do not have the memory space for the app and I got no warning that I would not be able to do so
len ratingfive Toight 
len ratingfive Noice 
len ratingfive Smort 
len ratingfive This app is amazing 
len ratingfive Everything I have stored on my drive and drives I have accessed to is at the top of my fingers 
len ratingfive I have not experienced any glitches since using this app I have had this app for a few years now 
len ratingfive Great download 
len ratingfive Great platform 
len ratingone I ve tried to transfer my contacts to my new phone by downloading it to drive 
len ratingone Not only did it say that it was downloaded but it said it was blank 
len ratingone So mad
len ratingfive I love having Google access on any device 
len ratingfive Great invention 
len ratingfive Try this first before u make your final judgement 
len ratingfive Believed me when I said this is the best app 
len ratingfive I CAN DO ANYTHING 
len ratingfive My program couldn t survive without it 
len ratingfive There are so many drives to choose from nowadays Google Outlook ICloud Dropbox Zoho 
len ratingfive While I do love Zoho and think that like google they are a very tech savvy and innovated company that actually listens and takes advice from their users I think Google Drive is probably the easiest to use 
len ratingfive But take notice that if I didn t have thousands of documents stored in google already there s a good chance I would ve made the switch to Zoho 
len ratingfive The main reason being storage limits 
len ratingfive google used to offer ways to earn or win extra storage space and now I don t believe they do 
len ratingfive Also the storage included is smaller than most drives offer 
len ratingfive The winning factor is that google photos will store unlimited pictures if that wasn t the case I wouldn t be able to use google at all 
len ratingfive I have over gb of photos stored currently 
len ratingfive I would like to see other ways to gain access to additional storage 
len ratingfive There are people that refuse to purchase things that aren t Physical objects or people who refuse to put their banking into on the internet 
len ratingfive Then there are people who simply can t afford extras in life 
len ratingfive I contribute a lot to all of googles programs including Express detailed reviews data on google maps etc 
len ratingfive That could be a way to reward people with storage space 
len ratingfive I guess I m saying that Zoho might be small but they are on your heels 
len ratingfive They offer these options google needs to step up 
len ratingfive There are millions of people in the market for couponing which means that today s internet users are cheap 
len ratingfive Google isn t going to go bankrupt by offering ways to earn free storage 
len ratingone When I download the app it tells me that there s nothing in my drive 
len ratingone Same thing when I download the docs app nothing 
len ratingone Why is this happening 
len ratingtwo Mud is coming run
len ratingfive I love how organized the drive can be from work and home computers to my iPad and phone 
len ratingfive Keep it up google 
len ratingfive I can t understand why I would need Dropbox if I have google drive 
len ratingfive Excellent source to store manage and modify files 
len ratingfive Easy to use and very mobile and efficient 
len ratingfive I have been using this for over a year and haven t had any problems in backing up files 
len ratingfive I put in the email address of anyone I want to share a file with 
len ratingfive No one I have shared files with have told me about any issues in accessing those files 
len ratingfive Muy bueno
len ratingone Very time I try to open a sheet or other file the app immediately crashes 
len ratingone iOS updated deleted and reinstalled app nothing changes 
len ratingone Completely useless 
len ratingfive I love how I can just play it with no problem
len ratingthree  From the provider of the most functional free email spam filter comes a cloud file sharing app that can t seem to figure out how to block nearly identical spam shares 
len ratingfive Gvtxvdjnbgcjvjbgbtgljfemjcv
len ratingfive  I ve been using Google Drive for about years now 
len ratingfive I needed something to replace iCloud 
len ratingfive I love the fact there is no limitations when you upload 
len ratingfive Just now I tried to open a video file to preview and somehow it showed a corrupted play button 
len ratingfive My heart dropped and all I had to do was close the app and restart it 
len ratingfive It worked fine 
len ratingfive The only reason why I m using Google Drive is so that my files aren t ever going to get corrupt on me 
len ratingfive Even if I send a copy to my camera roll I ll need it to show the exact date from when it s been uploaded or taken 
len ratingfive Perfectly the app does just that 
len ratingfive I m happy to use Google Drive for all the files 
len ratingfive Being a freelance photographer and cinematographer I d recommend this app to anyone 
len ratingfive Please don t change anything within the app to make it difficult or corrupt any of the files 
len ratingfive Update saving photo to camera roll doesn t show original date taken 
len ratingfive It shows the day I save to camera roll 
len ratingfive Uploads duplicates sometimes uploading a large amount of photos crashes the app uploading shows the wrong number of uploads 
len ratingfive Update Saving a photo or video slightly decreases the resolution 
len ratingfive We should be able to upload a photo or video with the resolution it was taken then saving it exactly how we upload it 
len ratingfive It s be very useful for photo document and android device back ups plus easy access from any laptop desktop etc for transfers or access in general it s a very useful mobile tool for me
len ratingfour I appreciate that I can store any documents pictures downloads here and can access them from any phone I own 
len ratingfour Love it and it helps so much
len ratingfive I use for work and personal reasons 
len ratingfive It s linked to gmail so I can share and edit with all my colleagues 
len ratingfive It s organized and like I said using it for work is great 
len ratingfive Sharing different folders with different combinations of people is so helpful when you focus on a lot of different things work related 
len ratingfive I do have an iPhone obviously so drive on google chrome with a pc is really the best version 
len ratingfive I might get a pixel just to see how much better my google account operates 
len ratingfive I m stuck with google but I love it
len ratingfive Never lost a file everything is uploaded without any errors can get my files on any of my devices that has google drive 
len ratingfive It s great
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Save everything from photos videos pdfs mps and more 
len ratingone After recent update application just shuts off and nothing works 
len ratingfive I love it it s easy to use and I have never had a problem
len ratingfive This is a great app because I don t always have my computer so having this app really improved my life
len ratingtwo Works well for general use it should improve with simple additional functionality such as creating a folder in the drive then uploading files into that folder 
len ratingfive Muy til
len ratingone I can t poop on a bigotry foop
len ratingfive Good drive google drive
len ratingone I can t figure out how to use this app 
len ratingone I can t edit anything what so ever 
len ratingfive Me gusta pero quisiera que para poder enviar video con mas MB pliss
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingfive  Im just learning as I go and I must say It is easy to use and work on personalizing your documents 
len ratingfive  out of hands down
len ratingfive Google drive is a great option for me I buy and sell house and am always needing store contracts and pictures online 
len ratingfour Please add support to lock the app and password protect files and folders
len ratingfive Ty for Drive
len ratingthree Protection should required Password Touch id Pass Code 
len ratingfour I love this app 
len ratingfour So easy to use in iOS 
len ratingfour Just one thing is missing in the app is the FaceLock System 
len ratingfour Please add passcode or facelock option to protect the documents in the app 
len ratingone There is no way to open a document from its URL 
len ratingone Completely useless if someone sends a link 
len ratingfive Google Drive works well for me on all my platforms iPad Chromebook and Windows environments 
len ratingfive I absolutely love all things Google 
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfive Perfect for having important documents at the ready 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingtwo I gave this app stars not because I didn t like it but because there weren t enough star reviews 
len ratingfive Works fantastic 
len ratingfive Wish I could scan documents easier though 
len ratingfive Great app to access all of my files
len ratingfour Push notifications can be difficult to manage 
len ratingfour The numbered indicator that pops up on the app icon does not resolve easily 
len ratingfour Otherwise a great app for information sharing and collaboration 
len ratingthree  Better than any app out there for managing photos 
len ratingthree Regular upgrades have added features I didn t know I needed 
len ratingthree May the drag and drop feature is now gone 
len ratingthree Hey 
len ratingfive Safest and coolest making ever
len ratingfive Love that I can access this from anywhere on any platform

len ratingtwo Either way you boys need to play more collaboratively not as opponents making as much money as possible 
len ratingfive I can work from any device and os 
len ratingfive I am a Windows user and was afraid to not be able to access it with my IOS devices that was not too long before 
len ratingfive Now I love the way I can easily access my information from most of my apps in IOS 
len ratingfive What I do is to work tirelessly to help people out of poverty and feed our homeless community and families 
len ratingfive Google Drive allows me to collaborate with partners in the community and leadership to help close the gap on poverty while traveling and at my office 
len ratingfive It is universal it is indispensable it is a tool for change 
len ratingfive Great for storage Great for keeping your memories alive I just love it I don t know what my phone would be without it

len ratingfive My classes use google drive for school work and keeps our work safe 
len ratingfive So I think that this is a good app
len ratingfive I really appreciate google drive because for the most part I don t know what I m doing 
len ratingfive Verry good
len ratingfive I use this everyday and have been completely satisfied 
len ratingfour I have been a Google user since it was in beta 
len ratingfour They have coded hundreds of useful tools since the beginning and I have tried and installed dozens of Google apps 
len ratingfour Google Drive is a great program and it is great knowing all is safe and makes access to all my files readily anytime and anywhere I go
len ratingone I created a spreadsheet on a PC 
len ratingone I shared it privately to myself 
len ratingone I need it to be usable on my phone so I can adjust it on the fly 
len ratingone My sheets app on my phone won t let me view it

len ratingfour What s the point of having this app really cant you just make one where you can access everything 
len ratingfour Everything else barely anything close to nothing was good but I was just really annoyed by that

len ratingthree This was the main reason I downloaded it as my brother is constantly on our one computer 
len ratingthree I am a bit disappointed 
len ratingone It wouldn t let me sign in to my school account so it was impossible to do my very important assignment
len ratingfive It s terrific been able to access my Google Drive from my iPhone 
len ratingfive And works great 
len ratingfive Drive is bae
len ratingfive Have an iPhone that takes great pictures and has plenty of storage but Apple gives me only GB of free iCloud backup storage 
len ratingfive ICloud sharing is great but it works well only with other Apple devices 
len ratingfive Google Photos overcomes both of these shortcomings unlimited storage and ability to share with any device 
len ratingfive Don t expect anything to mysteriously disappear 
len ratingfive It s a great way to save any type of file 
len ratingfive ANY TYPE

len ratingthree The videos are choppy and don t start and stop when in Drive
len ratingfive But its just need to add one feature which is unlock by a pass word to be a perfect app 
len ratingfive I LOVE GOOGLE DRIVE 
len ratingfive Thing is I wish there was more than just GB 
len ratingfive Not complaining but considering that Microsoft has all office apps PLUS TB of storage makes me want to use OneDrive more 
len ratingfive Maybe they could make some incentive other than just outright selling storage like they currently do Maybe Google Play Music YouTube Red and GB of storage 
len ratingfive It always works and has lots of great and useful features I don t feel like writing a real review just get the app
len ratingfive Excelente

len ratingfour THIS APP IS PRETTY FUN 
len ratingfour But it could change 
len ratingfour If you need a safe place to store your files perf 
len ratingfour But if you want to make fun slide shows and mess with silly fonts the will be challenges 
len ratingfour The last star left resembles the fact that the drive doesn t show all of the things you made and is hard to deal with 
len ratingone Retroactively limited gmail account and Google Drive total storage and same time want to charge for storage and closed account for sending and receiving email until pay or delete email 
len ratingone Furthermore They need a better spam filter the reason my mailbox is so full it s because I receive so much unwanted email 
len ratingone it just grew exponentially out of control 
len ratingone for an account I don t check that often 
len ratingfive Easy use and wonderful app
len ratingfive It is convenient to have some files on google drive so I can get to them from all my devices
len ratingfive Not much to say but worth every penny for additional storage

len ratingtwo The battery stats reveal that Drive is using the most battery of any app for a background activity even when I don t have the app open 
len ratingfive I am able to work on the go 
len ratingfive So great to be able to edit documents with my phone 
len ratingfive And transfer and receive documents as I want

len ratingfive I store everything here docs pics and videos

len ratingfive You can rename your pic or video and create many folders and name it to whatever you want 
len ratingfive Saves tons of space on your phone and can access it from whatever device your on 
len ratingfive Plenty of storage space to just keep adding 
len ratingfive You can t go wrong with it 
len ratingfive If you want something easy to use and want to save space on your phone and have a place to store all your photos and videos and free then this is for you but if you don t want any of that then it s not for you

len ratingfive This works well for me 
len ratingfive Smooth and great user experience 
len ratingfive Great product 
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfour I like the Google ecosystem I use Gmail Drive Voice and more but Drive does not sync fast enough sometimes it takes a great while 
len ratingfour Moreover OSX tags don t come over on the sync 
len ratingfour Also unlike Dropbox there s no way I could figure short of pausing quitting the app then resuming restarting to sync on the fly 
len ratingfour Frustrating 
len ratingfour Dropbox is more elegant especially for sharing 
len ratingfour Also it appears unless I m mistaken that Drive does not allow different accounts on one computer whereas Dropbox does as I recall 
len ratingfive This is such a helpful tool 
len ratingfive So much space and easy to share documents 
len ratingfive Google Drive has become indispensable for my work and home lives

len ratingfive No hiccups thus far

len ratingone I contacted support and spent two hours back and forth with Angel who asked me repeated questions and wasn t listening to the issue 
len ratingone I reported it as spam but it s still there

len ratingone Ridiculous

len ratingfive I m a teacher and it makes everything easy accessible and orderly 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Great job google 
len ratingfive The best barring rainbows 
len ratingfive I am still critiquing I am a totally blind person attempting to use this product for the first time under these digital circumstances 
len ratingfive Super efficient and cost less

len ratingfive Would recommend this to anyone for personal or business use 
len ratingfive Unlimited storage 
len ratingfive What s not to love
len ratingfour I really love drive I use it for all my schoolwork I am a student

len ratingfive One issue I have is I wish you could have separate Google Dives open to transfer files 
len ratingfive Second issue is that with my HP printer I can only sync GoogleDrive account to print from on an iPad iPhone 
len ratingfive Otherwise I can never lose any materials 
len ratingthree Things like renaming were available on before uploading so you dont have to manually do it after uploading

len ratingthree Going through the Camera settings dousnt seem to resolve the file type issue
len ratingfive Google drive has been a lifesaver for me

len ratingfive I highly recommend it 
len ratingfive I am relying more and more on my Google Drive to hold and also share files with friends and colleagues 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and it has the same basic features as a Microsoft Suite such as spreadsheets and word processing documents which is nice because I don t have to maintain an annual subscription because they come free in Drive 
len ratingfive Can I send a copy of my IMPORTANT or CHERISHED anything to a computer in space that will hold it for me AND unlimited progeny of mine

len ratingfive This way my photos stay safe and I don t have to worry about storage issues 
len ratingfive They always upload fast and no matter how many I upload the app itself doesn t take up anymore storage than how much it did before I started uploading pictures

len ratingthree There were multiple times where I wanted to throw my phone on bang my head on the key board but more times than not it worked with flying colors

len ratingone I m paying for cloud storage not to be constantly pestered for reviews 
len ratingone Total crap
len ratingfive I have a small business and there s nothing accessing important files from anywhere 
len ratingfive Very convenient and makes doing business easy 
len ratingfour This is awesome as you can store and retrieve files from anywhere 
len ratingfour I would give it stars but I don t know enough about the security of it
len ratingfive Have a large record collection all in the cloud and on demand

len ratingone Always buffers never can do anything
len ratingfive As Board Co President of a small community religious organization I have lots of experience using this app 
len ratingfive As most of us are already connected to Google it seemed the most convenient way to share info and has served us well 
len ratingfive I cannot compare to other apps of this type as this is the only one I ve used but for our purposes it works well

len ratingfive Was greeted by Jasmine 
len ratingfive She painted a big smile welcomed me and seemed eager to help 
len ratingfive She politely asked for my info and offered a friendly small talk 
len ratingfive Seconds later she handed me keys and a Map she highlighted the directions to my room and thanked me for choosing her Hotel 
len ratingfive I Entered the room and was pleased with arrangement and the cleanliness not to mention the comfortable bed and the soft and firm pillow combo 
len ratingfive Marguarita would leave the room spotless neat and tidy 
len ratingfive She would also hand write daily thank you notes for staying at her Hotel 
len ratingfive One thing attracted my attention and I had never seen in all the other Hotels was how the first layer of each of the Napkin Holder the Kleenex tissue box and the toilet paper roll were folded in a v formation making it easy for quick pull out 
len ratingfive I am a sucker for small things like that and I am not being corky about it 
len ratingfive My stay was for nights and every morning during Breakfast I would bump into the cafeteria employees and none of them would miss looking me in the eyes wishing me Good morning and offering to help find things 
len ratingfive Angie and Cheryl work hard work clean and very efficient 
len ratingfive They always stopped for a small talk regardless how busy they may seem 
len ratingfive I also met other desk employees Nahla Layla and Matt

len ratingfive Google Dive is definitely the bomb 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingthree This is a great app that allows you to store your online stuff even if you don t have a google account 
len ratingthree The standard size is fair and there are no demanding adds or annoying push notices when you reach your max I use this in share mode to share project files for my company many cloud services allow this and have apps to expand however other online services offer more 
len ratingthree There is no shared calendar function no stl viewer and no dwf plug in so a good bulk of our work is shared with other services we only split it up for the extra space

len ratingfive I keep everything on here

len ratingfive I love Google Drive

len ratingfive I wouldn t be able to run both companies at the same time without it
len ratingfour Google Drive has saved my rear on multiple occasions 
len ratingfour I wish I could have given this app a stars but Apple doesn t allow for that 
len ratingfour My only complaint is the fact that only a certain amount of people can open a shared drive via a link 
len ratingfour If this problem gets resolved my rating will go up to stars immediately 
len ratingfive I love google drive
len ratingfive This Is A Great App

len ratingfive This is an amazing feature from google 
len ratingfive Wishing that the free storage should be bigger 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive Video uploaded quickly and I was able to share it w others
len ratingfive I wish this was around when I first started going to College University because it would helped me out tremendously Anticipated To Graduate 
len ratingone Good job google on removing one of the most important features and worst of all with no notice moving on to dropbox 
len ratingfive This is awesome ever thing is so easy to fine
len ratingtwo There is no beauty or enjoyment in using this cloud app 
len ratingtwo I constantly struggle to make sense of the structure of things and how it decides which items to place into quick access 
len ratingtwo I would suggest a complete and total overhaul of the app in both structure aesthetic 
len ratingtwo The basic cloud functions just fine but this is a crowded space 
len ratingtwo There are no shortage of cloud storage apps on the AppStore and simply resting on your laurels as Google s cloud app just isn t cutting it guys 
len ratingtwo You may have to actually apply yourselves here 
len ratingtwo Fire up those fingers and add some code that mess 
len ratingone Ask once fine 
len ratingone But Google has decided to repeatedly nag users for ratings so here you go 
len ratingfour It would be a great if u add a drag and drop feature for moving documents around in drive 
len ratingfour It ll just make it easier 
len ratingfour Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive Really easy to quick check if things have been edited with having to start up computer
len ratingone  I liked the app until you got rid of the internal passcode 
len ratingone What a dumb thing to do 
len ratingone Pointless for me to have the app now 
len ratingfive If you need space Google drive provides lots of space 
len ratingfive Can be a little slow at times but otherwise I recommend 
len ratingfive This is really good for using on your phone at school if your computer is not working 
len ratingfive I love google it s very user friendly 
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfive It s awesome 
len ratingfive I can keep track of all my documents and assignments for school 
len ratingfive Drive is great 
len ratingfive So easy to use creating folders transferring files 
len ratingfive Everything in one place 
len ratingfive Love the App
len ratingfive It s gut
len ratingfive I was considering traveling with my big full size laptop until I realized that I could access my cloud storages with my iPad 
len ratingfive So happy to travel light 
len ratingfive I find it useful easy and effective in my school work and in professional capacities 
len ratingfive Wonderful software 
len ratingfive Love that I can get to my files from my iPad anywhere 
len ratingfour Could be better and make me feel better if google and the gov weren t going through all my pictures and stuff in the app
len ratingfive Works very well
len ratingfive Really awesome how to share files and do joint editing 
len ratingfive Wish this was around years ago 
len ratingone It doesn t download on my iPhone anymore
len ratingfive Google drive works great for me 
len ratingfive I keep my documents safely and share files when I need too 
len ratingfive The ability to access files from iPhone automatically updated from PC and Mac is great 
len ratingfive Absolutely fantastic that I can access all my Gdocs on my mobile 
len ratingfive User friendly Can share with Coworkers and others Can send assignments to students See date and time students turned in assignments Can grade assignments with Fluburoo app Works very well with Classroom app
len ratingthree Hi im iphone x user can you please add face id again so i can lock my g drive 
len ratingthree Earlier it was working fine
len ratingfive Just perfect and no one can miss it 
len ratingfive We remember and celebrate 
len ratingfive What a beautiful tribute to honor your dad 
len ratingthree Drive should allow you to edit spreadsheets
len ratingthree  So far it is the closest thing to a file system Apple will let you have on iOS 
len ratingthree But obviously still can t meet all basic needs 
len ratingthree The current version constantly crashes if you try to view offline files which hadn t been loading for a while now but now the entire app crashes if you try to view them 
len ratingfive Love that it s simple to see and easy to use
len ratingfive as long as they dont start stealing my important files i give them stars because i have never encountered a more convenient way to instantly access share or transfer my important codes 
len ratingfive google hasnt done me wrong yet on the contrary google has supplied me life changing information on multiple occasions 
len ratingfive feasibly i may never be the same because of my brush in this life with google but im not looking back yet 
len ratingfive The perfect storage place 
len ratingtwo Mainly use the app to upload iPhone vids to Google Drive to free up storage 
len ratingtwo Over time the uploads have become slower and slower 
len ratingtwo A second clip that once took minutes now takes 
len ratingtwo A five minute clip that once took minutes now produces an Upload Failed message of the time and on the rare occasions it completes the upload it takes well over minutes 
len ratingtwo My ISPs upload speeds consistently test near Mbps but the Google Drive servers don t seem able to accommodate even that small amount 
len ratingtwo Occasionally I ll be able to use a nice upload connection between Mbps but there is little if any improvement in upload speed 
len ratingtwo It is becoming nearly impractical to continue using this app 
len ratingtwo Shopping for alternatives 
len ratingone I can t imaging disliking google any more than I already do
len ratingfour Let me start by saying I love this app it s great when I need to send large files to people and just moving files between my devices 
len ratingfour What I wish they would work on is it he UI 
len ratingfour It s very stylized in a way I guess to try and help but I don t want all that recent files stuff or recent objects I just want a simple files list and maybe a little icon to denote shared files 
len ratingfour I can see how it might help some but I when you are working on a project between multiple files that have objects with similar names it can get really confusing when it all pops up as recent files
len ratingfive  Stars

len ratingfive As an outside sales rep for several companies it is important for me to have access to product information from each company always at my fingertips 
len ratingfive Google Drive let s me sync lots of photos and data to my laptop cell phone I pad and my desktop PC simultaneously 
len ratingfive Once updated all devices are ready for any inquiry I might receive 
len ratingfive Updating the files is simple 
len ratingfive Just move the latest data into the Google Drive directory or delete the files that are no longer necessary 
len ratingfive Google Drive offers a generous amount of storage space for free 
len ratingfive The data updates are seamless and almost instantaneous 
len ratingfive Absolutely love this app 
len ratingfive It saves all my files quickly and is easily accessible 
len ratingfive Love having all my printables on my phone 
len ratingfive So easy to use

len ratingfive It is a great great product
len ratingfive I use Drive to backup edited photos on my PC and access them from my phone

len ratingthree Yes it has the features one typically want in cloud storage 
len ratingthree It integrates into other Google products 
len ratingthree It gets the job done 
len ratingthree What I don t find helpful is the way drive offers its features and the way it integrates into those other products 
len ratingthree Google designers all seem to be thinking along similar lines of what is straightforward makes sense it way of thinking 
len ratingthree The world is much more diverse than that

len ratingfour Very sleek and intuitive app 
len ratingfour My only issues are when I m listening to recordings of original songs that my band shares using the drive 
len ratingfour When I m testing a mix sometimes I like to hear the same song on repeat or cycle through multiple songs 
len ratingfour Basically it is frustrating not having Playlist features for folders with audio files 
len ratingfour I have to move tracks over to my iTunes app later on my computer to use Playlist features that make listening easy 
len ratingfour I know this is iffy territory for a file sharing app because you don t want people to be sharing files they don t own 
len ratingfour But it would seriously help musicians so much

len ratingfive In order to function effectively you must engage stakeholders

len ratingthree I have my Order ID to confirm my purchase 
len ratingthree I have contacted Apple and was told that everything looked fine on their side 
len ratingthree I then contacted Google and was told that everything looked fine on their side 
len ratingthree The Google tech told me to check back with Apple but that I would be given the TB for days while things were sorted out 
len ratingthree The Google tech also said that if the storage issue could not be fixed to request a refund and to then repurchase the storage

len ratingthree  GB is nothing if you want to save backups of movies etc and if you are a student GB is manageable but where I had thoughts to keep copies of my movies I don t want to pay for more storage 
len ratingthree Call me a miser but Google had me at free now it s free with a modest limit 
len ratingthree I hope they can re think this
len ratingfive I use this app everyday 
len ratingfive It helps to organize all my documents and have them available whenever I need them 
len ratingfive I love easy access from my phone tablet laptop car boat train plane

len ratingone Google is great 
len ratingone But All my documents are now the governments and probably property for google because of some agreement I signed into 
len ratingone Switch to working offline and backing up your own work 
len ratingone Just kidding this app is great an I only know people read one star reviews 
len ratingone But everything I said is still true just I give this app a solid 
len ratingone Google Sheets Drive on iOS Mobile is so frustrating 
len ratingone Crashes all the time cloud docs don t appear as expected 
len ratingone Cmon 
len ratingfive  I ve been using Google Drive for about years now 
len ratingfive I needed something to replace iCloud 
len ratingfive I love the fact there is no limitations when you upload 
len ratingfive Just now I tried to open a video file to preview and somehow it showed a corrupted play button 
len ratingfive My heart dropped and all I had to do was close the app and restart it 
len ratingfive It worked fine 
len ratingfive The only reason why I m using Google Drive is so that my files aren t ever going to get corrupt on me 
len ratingfive Even if I send a copy to my camera roll I ll need it to show the exact date from when it s been uploaded or taken 
len ratingfive Perfectly the app does just that 
len ratingfive I m happy to use Google Drive for all the files 
len ratingfive Being a freelance photographer and cinematographer I d recommend this app to anyone 
len ratingfive Please don t change anything within the app to make it difficult or corrupt any of the files 
len ratingfive Update saving photo to camera roll doesn t show original date taken 
len ratingfive It shows the day I save to camera roll 
len ratingfive Uploads duplicates sometimes uploading a large amount of photos crashes the app uploading shows the wrong number of uploads 
len ratingfive Please fix issues
len ratingfive Awesome tool for work and home 
len ratingtwo Even after having bars on LTE with sprint google drive is not pulling up any of my flash cards saved 
len ratingfive I can review all of my documents from my phone 
len ratingfive This makes it so nice 
len ratingfive I can work from my phone 
len ratingone Was using drive though safari and it was fast downloaded the app and it s slow thinking of removing the app 
len ratingfive It s a good thing to have on your phone so you can look and work on things on the go I give it stars
len ratingfive Love Google Drive for everything
len ratingfive All the documents and sheets available on my app no matter where I am 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive User friendly 
len ratingfive And I can share them too from the app 
len ratingfive Works great and very convenient
len ratingfive Great tool quick and easy to use
len ratingfive I love this app heaps
len ratingone This app is absolutely useless to me 
len ratingone I use Drive for work and all the files are in Team Drives which for no apparent reason you can t access from the app 
len ratingfive This is the best app I have 
len ratingfive It automatically uploads all photos from my iPhone 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingfive It s fast easy organized 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingthree I hate that I can t use multiple documents at the same time and that I can t use it in the web browser either
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingthree A much needed means to transfer files between platforms 
len ratingthree It can be slick and swift 
len ratingthree Then when it decides you don t meet its protocols it bombs out with either a message it couldn t do it without reason or with a message that offers no solution 
len ratingthree  Like file larger than some very modest size 
len ratingfive Amazing l recommend everyone tries this
len ratingfive Excelente app
len ratingfive Drive is good 
len ratingfive This is a great thing to use because I m able to share files with others
len ratingfive It s an amazing storage app 
len ratingfive Never had a complaint about it 
len ratingfive I am a very very busy individual 
len ratingfive This app is perfect when you are crunched on time 
len ratingfive You could literally start your paper on your mobile device 
len ratingfive It has helped me on time 
len ratingfive Thank you Google for giving us free access to things we once had to pay a lot of money to Microsoft to get 
len ratingfive On top of that you created a way to easily share your work with others and choose the kind of access we d like to grant 
len ratingfive I feel strange writing a review for something that I m quite certain everyone knows about and uses but in case you don t I hope the reviews help 
len ratingfive If you are new do not worry 
len ratingfive Drive will walk you through getting started 
len ratingfive You can create documents from scratch and personalize the formatting 
len ratingfive You can share your work with others or work on the same document together at the same time from different locations 
len ratingfive You can work on the same doc at the same time from each of your houses 
len ratingfive Or you can give some one access to only view your work without being able to edit 
len ratingfive Other options exist as well such as allowing access to comment on your work 
len ratingfive There are templates for most projects as well 
len ratingfive You can create spreadsheets and format them the same way you would in Excel 
len ratingfive The algorithms should be the same or similar 
len ratingfive You can create graphs or charts in doc or sheets 
len ratingfive You can also create surveys from setting up conferences to a sign up for a potluck 
len ratingfive You have the ability to create presentations as well 
len ratingfive Other fantastic features include auto saving and a change history which allows you to see who changed what and when they did 
len ratingfive Some things to note is that it s easier to use Google Drive if you use Chrome as your browser 
len ratingfive With chrome as your browser then you can mass highlight and copy to your drive 
len ratingfive You can also use the drag and drop option 
len ratingfive If you re in safari you have to do each doc one at a time 
len ratingfive Once you get used to using chrome and google drive it will become so easy that you ll feel like you ve been doing it you re whole life 
len ratingfive The two main reasons why Drive is amazing are that it is completely free no strings attached and because you can collaborate on projects documents

len ratingfour My major issue with Drive on iOS is that to view offline one marks a doc in Drive 
len ratingfour To edit offline one has to mark it in Docs Sheets Slides 
len ratingfour A bit of a pain to remember all the time 
len ratingfour I live in Drive not in each app 
len ratingfour A secondary issue is I can t download files 
len ratingfour Finally iOS sorta has a local file browser 
len ratingfour But I can t for instance download a CBR file I have in Drive so it can be opened in a reader 
len ratingfour Drive doesn t have viewer for more then CBR files 
len ratingfour But unsupported extensions is an example of why not to use Drive to store all your stuff to access on any device

len ratingfive Seriously I don t know what I would do without it 
len ratingfive All my storage and functionality needs rolled into one 
len ratingfive Great tool keeps our team on track 
len ratingone We try and use Drive across our organization and it s infuriatingly buggy 
len ratingone Shared files and folders rarely update as they should and we have experienced IT people using this software 
len ratingfive Google rocks need I say more pppeeshhh

len ratingfive I have all my precious video on file 
len ratingfive Easy upload 
len ratingthree Let me first say that I m one of the biggest Google fanboys and I love everything they put out 
len ratingthree What I don t understand is why there s no additional Touch ID or Passcode Security for this app 
len ratingthree I keep a lot of personal secure info on my Google Drive and think that there should be an additional layer of security like there is with other apps like Mint LastPass etc Am I the only one who feels this way 
len ratingfive  It works
len ratingfive Great awesome best ever cloud never be worry about loosing your docs or files
len ratingfive This app is for the tech savvy user fact is that iCloud is actually leased off of Google s server so in essence this is the top of the food chain

len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingfive Thank you google
len ratingfive best

len ratingfive Has never let me down 
len ratingfive Need a free more space is very small
len ratingfive Overall this app is the perfect way to store all my documents and folders online without any repercussions 
len ratingfive Everything works smoothly and the layout is easy to understand 
len ratingfive However I would really appreciate mobile support for zip and rar files seeing as most of the data I work with is sent to me in those formats 
len ratingfive For now all it says when I attempt to open one is unsupported file type 
len ratingfive Wouldn t it be neat if everyone using this app had the ability to open and browse through zip files without having to find the nearest computer 
len ratingfive Simple and easy to use 
len ratingfive  O K 
len ratingfive I love the drive 
len ratingfive It is very convenient for on the go use of files for group projects and work 
len ratingfive I have always loved the way Drive lets me have my pictures documents and videos wherever I am and to easily share them with others 
len ratingfive My school district became a Google Apps for Education district after several of us asked for it over the past years 
len ratingfive I am excited that instead of showing my students how functional and valuable this app is they can now see for themselves 
len ratingfour I love the flexibility of accessing from Lee anywhere and from all of my devices

len ratingfive Fun and makes it easy to get our documents from Docs Slides and Spreadsheet
len ratingfive Great for online sharing editing and cloud storage 
len ratingone Totally disappointed lost about pictures 
len ratingone No way to recover
len ratingone The interface is just horrible 
len ratingone Trying to move documents between email accounts and finding documents make me honestly consider killing myself 
len ratingthree Google drive is great but my main use of it is accessing PDFs online and it is ridiculous to keep scrolling to the desired page every time I open a document 
len ratingthree It is a basic necessity I think that the PDF opens to the last page you were on and that you can easily access the end of the PDF i e 
len ratingthree In a reasonable amount of time I have spent the last minutes scrolling through a large PDF and then the app crashing on me and then opening it up again to the very first page 
len ratingthree It is so frustrating 
len ratingthree There are other apps that are simply better for PDF viewing 
len ratingthree Drive is just my go to app so its a common frustration that I encounter 
len ratingthree I found very difficult to play pause and close the video in this app 
len ratingthree Please fix this issue

len ratingfive Real cool 
len ratingfive It was a very useful tool for school and now I am using this app for my bee P B L

len ratingthree Got a doc from google put directly into my google drive and it s a file I can not open from the drive 
len ratingthree LOL 
len ratingthree Wow
len ratingfive Easy to use and the MS Office alternatives like slides docs and sheets get the job done 
len ratingfive I use the heck out of Google Drive and Docs 
len ratingfive My son also uses the services with Google classroom 
len ratingfive Switching between what I do and my son does is a piece of cake 
len ratingfive Switching between Google and MS docs is easy as well 
len ratingfive Log in from anything and get to work from anywhere 
len ratingfive It s also easy to share email and collaborate on projects 
len ratingfive You can also use third party apps to edit pdf files among other things 
len ratingfive I m sure their is much more but you can figure it out for yourself 
len ratingfive Lo que uno de verdad aprecia atesorarlo en Google Drive
len ratingtwo Items in drive on phone and iPad are out of order 
len ratingtwo Extremely frustrating 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingone Not up to date
len ratingfive I love how it organizes everything perfectly 
len ratingtwo Apparently months ago I upgraded storage to MB but still can only go up to MB and my account is full

len ratingfive Mostly it was due the fact it was super convenient

len ratingthree Works well but I don t like how they eliminated the extra password protection to get in 
len ratingfive very helpful
len ratingfive Isjshdhfhfjdhdhdjd
len ratingfive Love storing my plans here 
len ratingthree Overall google drive is a really great product 
len ratingthree I m just giving a three star rating for the ios app since they removed the option to use touch id and face id to secure it 
len ratingthree A lot of people borrow my phone and i prefer to keep my files stored on google drive secure 
len ratingthree Now i always log off after each use and it s cumbersome to input my password every time i need to use the app 
len ratingone I m not a fan of this app unfortunately 
len ratingone The user interface is pretty crummy and it s hard to troubleshoot when things go wrong 
len ratingone It also doesn t interface well with gmail

len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I can get my files anywhere I go and it s very easy to access it 
len ratingfive I don t have to worry about the hard drive size space and no worries on hard drive crashes issue anymore 
len ratingone Whatever is going on with google drive which makes files which we have rightful access to inaccessible for long periods of time days is absolutely ridiculous 
len ratingone Scores of people are talking about it on he internet AND when I finally get access back randomly the closed captioning on a series I watch is no longer available due to your tech glitch so I might as well not have access 
len ratingone Google NEEDS TO FIX THIS NOW 
len ratingone You are losing clients over this 
len ratingfive My mother passed away almost years ago and I can t tell you how lucky I am that I was able to download several of her voicemails to Google drive before I changed phones

len ratingfive Science Olympiad By Brooke Graziano The date was April th which was a Saturday 
len ratingfive My mom woke me up at around like I asked her to 
len ratingfive I had two Eggo waffles with syrup and blueberries on top 
len ratingfive I brushed my teeth and then put on my lime green t shirt the TES Science Olympiad shirt 
len ratingfive The front of the shirt in the top left hand corner said TES Science Olympiad and a picture of two atoms 
len ratingfive The back said in big black letters I M NOT LAZY I M WORKING ON MY POTENTIAL ENERGY in all caps just like I wrote it 
len ratingfive My mom and I packed up the car with two lunchboxes one tote of cookies one box of Goldfish ten boxes of Twizzlers and seven poster boards 
len ratingfive The seven posters were for the opening ceremony and the awards ceremony and the boxes of Twizzlers were for giving to the other teams and wishing them good luck with all of those the school was sure we would win the Spirit Award 
len ratingfive We drove to Heide Trask High School 
len ratingfive We unloaded the trunk and took it into the school 
len ratingfive At the front door was a registration table 
len ratingfive We told the volunteer our names and that I was a TES student and she told us our room number 
len ratingfive Our room called Home Base was a classroom that taught electrical things like wiring 
len ratingfive There was a few wood pillars and a wood floor in the back of the room and it looks like the students had been wiring it the previous day 
len ratingfive I put down the lunchbox I was carrying but I still held the posters 
len ratingfive I walked to the corner and my friend Claire was working on a poster with her friends Jordan Lily and Kendall 
len ratingfive The sign said GO TES and Claire told me that everyone was going to sign it 
len ratingfive After they finished their poster I showed them all of mine 
len ratingfive They were very excited 
len ratingfive More and more people began coming in 
len ratingfive There was three boys that wouldn t let go of some of the signs one sign had a huge T one had a huge E and one had a huge S They were in a line so together it said TES 
len ratingfive At around another girl came in with the same kinds of signs I mentioned before but they were more decorated one had small paper boxes they were actually d 
len ratingfive inside the S which if you put the boxes together spelled SCIENCE OLYMPIAD 
len ratingfive Very good

len ratingfive No more desktop to keep me tied down 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive heavily for several years including many work related projects

len ratingfour Easy to use for someone like me that don t have much of experience with smartphones and computers 
len ratingfour Still learning and google makes it posible 
len ratingone This is one of the most needlessly complicated and annoying apps 
len ratingone It organizes everything to the point that you have to click through multiple tabs just to be able find the button to save something to your phone 
len ratingone I would avoid using drive as much as possible

len ratingfour Have been using it for years and really like it 
len ratingfour I just wish that it had the features of box where you can upload to a specific folder and rename all at the same time 
len ratingfive Drive and the GSuite tools are great tools

len ratingone  This app is a really let down by Google 
len ratingone So great in the Android counterpart not well integrated in the iOS environment 
len ratingone Continuous crash in the sharing session when receiving access requests to file 
len ratingone The app sets of on the same course and follows negative technical choices as Team Drives which is another unusable tool for business purposes due to lack of external sharing 
len ratingone In fact Team Drives is also practically not integrated in iOS Google Drive app 
len ratingfive I just wish it was easier to use with my MacBook Air 
len ratingfive I am finding Google Drive is helpful for me to reach my files wherever I am 
len ratingfive Works good 
len ratingfour I wish that when I turn on rotation lock it wouldn t force the portrait view 
len ratingfive Easy to use and wonderful resource to be able to use 
len ratingfive I have used it for long time and has worked well 
len ratingfive The app makes it easy to keep all of your files sorted and you can access from anywhere 
len ratingone Can t save documents from files app 
len ratingone When google drive is installed anything I open from files redirects to drive and then I can t open it 
len ratingfive As online collaboration increases having data at my fingertips is essential

len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingfive Easy to use quick access to all your saved files in one place love google products
len ratingfive The app works exactly as stated
len ratingfive I easy to use cloud share app files sync seamlessly across devices and platforms 
len ratingfive Google offers more space options and tiers of storage pricing than competitors and that s a big differentiator 
len ratingfive No hassle 
len ratingfive Do exactly what you need to do 
len ratingone What s the point of having this app if the only thing you can do with it is look at the things you ve made 
len ratingone Why do you need to buy a separate app every time you use something different

len ratingfive Every time i need be safe from any kind of problems for backup this app is very helpful
len ratingfive A basic toolbox that does SO much

len ratingone Lame 
len ratingtwo I m not sure why but my photos won t automatically upload even after reinstalling

len ratingfour When I try to move a pdf from the iPhone app to a folder in a drive it gives me an error 
len ratingfour something went wrong please try again later

len ratingthree nd the app exits when trying to create a folder before saving PDF

len ratingfive therobuxapp 
len ratingfive com gives yo a virtual reality tablet just kidding
len ratingfive This app does everything it is intended to do 
len ratingfive Works seamlessly 
len ratingfive needed app to email myself videos because iphone hates people and hates people putting videos on their phone 
len ratingfive fixed that problem now i can watch all the dirty videos i want on my iphone 
len ratingfive Google drive helps keep things organized 
len ratingfive Really enjoy this App
len ratingtwo I m new to iPhone and I am very disappointed in the google drive app 
len ratingtwo I was in a hectic situation where I needed to scan some documents quickly and email them 
len ratingtwo Coming from Android I assumed that I could quickly do this by using the scan feature in google drive 
len ratingtwo On this iOS app there is no scan feature just camera so I couldn t do what I needed to do with this app 
len ratingtwo I had to use Apple s Notes app to scan my documents 
len ratingtwo  GET IT TOGETHER AND BRING THE FEATURES FROM ANDROID TO IOS this shouldn t have to be said 
len ratingone New update not letting me play mp 
len ratingone For some reason Google has removed all security no passcode no touch id 
len ratingone If you keep sensitive documents in drive this is not a good option for iPhone 
len ratingone I really wish Google would add touch id capability to their iPhone apps including drive Gmail calendar 
len ratingone Every other app I have that has access to potentially sensitive information has touch id capability 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone Can never find my back up 
len ratingone Don t even see my back ups for kmt
len ratingfive Drive is an awesome tool if you are in the Google ecosystem
len ratingfive The more I use it the more I like it 
len ratingfive Great for keeping a YoY photo collection 
len ratingfive I m not a techno reviewer or anything just a simple layman but here s what I can say 
len ratingfive I can work on files I can organize my stuff I can easily get to it and I can modify and share it rather easily 
len ratingfive Edit send email message screenshot everything has begun to fall into place for the drive family and the docs sheets presentation formats 
len ratingfive I just work solely off my IPad mini and iPhone now unless some unusual feature requires me to get on my laptop to fix my issue 
len ratingfive I can t wait for what drive has next 
len ratingone Very glitchy and annoying
len ratingfive This is an excellent storage drive 
len ratingfive Simple to use and your stuff is available anywhere all the time 
len ratingfour Update It s now surprisingly difficult to share jpg and gif to the imessenger app 
len ratingfour  Never had a problem with it 
len ratingfour Good job devs you ve made the cloud more accessible than Apple 
len ratingfour  payyourdevsbetter
len ratingfive And it s integrated with Google Docs 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive I love being able to access everything I need from any device 
len ratingfive It keeps me and my family aligned 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone The new updates cause the app to crash when trying to retrieve files 
len ratingone FIX IT 
len ratingfive It s a nice app 
len ratingthree TELL ME
len ratingfive Docs can t view PDFs so I had to download drive 
len ratingfive Now I m great
len ratingfive Need I type any more 
len ratingfive Google is the best
len ratingfive So happy I downloaded the uploaded to my laptop 
len ratingfive Just the other day it crashed after an update and I had just done an elaborate excel sheet 
len ratingfive Thank God it was saved to my google drive now I can rest knowing that my data is saved regardless what happens to my laptop 
len ratingfive It s good lol
len ratingfive This provided a greater choice of options then what iOS offers 
len ratingfive Found stuff from years ago I thought I d lost 
len ratingfive Dropbox mysteriously emptied out my stuff but Drive was as easy as logging back on and seeing all my old things exactly as I left them 
len ratingfive I stan google 
len ratingfive Easy and efficient 
len ratingfive Easy to use and documents are available anytime on any device 
len ratingfive Perfect for storing anything from class projects to music projects 
len ratingfive Easy to use great middle ground between my Mac and PC 
len ratingfive App works wonderfully 
len ratingfive This App helps me with my work by connecting me with my parters in a easy to use platform with many resources 
len ratingfive I was happy at first Then after installing the desktop application on my PC I became sooooo much happier 
len ratingfive By simply reducing the quality from Original to High Quality gives you an unlimited amount of storage space 
len ratingfive Backing my entire computer s library up to it now lol not to mention the ability to access it all from anywhere is the cherry on top 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingone The images say jpg but I can t see them 
len ratingone Highly disappointed 
len ratingfive I believe google drive is great way of staying connected world wide 
len ratingfive Super great tool 
len ratingfour You can view and edit all google applications but you can t make new ones of everything which is frustrating but everything else is good 
len ratingfive Accuracy 
len ratingfive Really love the secure experience having my Most Important memories accessible
len ratingtwo I m not as impressed with Google Drive as other drives 
len ratingtwo It s very difficult to move files around to other folders 
len ratingtwo Hitting the back button takes you back to the root directory of your drive rather than the folder you came from 
len ratingfive Yep
len ratingfour This is very useful 
len ratingfour You can do stuff on it when your bored like do google drawings or write a story 
len ratingfour Or you can use it for useful purposes like school or calendars or other things that involve writing images 
len ratingfive Great Job creating But what about Drawings
len ratingfive I really like it
len ratingfour Awesome app
len ratingfive That s all I can say 
len ratingone Takes too long for documents to load session times out before anything is visible 
len ratingfive  Bellissimo
len ratingfive This app allows you to organize collaborate and gives you free GB 
len ratingfive There s not much more to say it s my best friend for getting work done 
len ratingfive For people on the move and in the hustle this app saves me pain and anxiety 
len ratingfive Loading what I need to access in transit means I am prepared for sharing and collecting to access later 
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingfour But the iPad app has a few problems 
len ratingfour One bug I just noticed is that image thumbnails instead of being scaled to fit within a square ratio are stretched instead distorting the image 
len ratingfive Have never had an issue with drive love it
len ratingone Otherwise great
len ratingone Doesn t give easy access to the Team Drives 
len ratingone I went back to search online to see if I was missing anything but comments to google dated last year also stated the same issues 
len ratingone So either this is something Google is still working on or Google doesn t think is important enough to fix 
len ratingtwo Your latest updates crashes the app anytime I try to check notifications 
len ratingtwo I am on an Iphone X 
len ratingfive Now I can use phone or iPad to conduct my business in comfort
len ratingfive This is a must have on your device
len ratingfive Affordable lots of room supports everything
len ratingfive Google
len ratingone It is so ugly it makes me want to barf
len ratingfour It s a shift from what i know but what i know isn t the best 
len ratingfour Moving from network based to cloud based is really cool and i think Google has done a great job evolving this feature 
len ratingfour Keeps all my files with me where liver I go 
len ratingfour I can t imagine not having it 
len ratingfour The only reason I gave it four stars is because you have to download each application separately to edit your files 
len ratingfour So you must download Sheets Slides Docs as well 
len ratingtwo This was a previously wonderful app that accomplished so many things 
len ratingtwo Five out of five 
len ratingtwo Then for some reason they eliminated the passcode lock 
len ratingtwo No more security 
len ratingtwo And worse if I sign into ANY Google product all of them are activated 
len ratingtwo An idiotic move 
len ratingtwo Unbelievable 
len ratingfive  This makes my work with documents very efficient 
len ratingfive It also organizes my work very nicely too 
len ratingfive great app
len ratingfive  Can save a bunch of digital files for free 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a great app to store videos pics etc 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and manage 
len ratingfive I like the share feature where the person can download whatever is on your drive with permissions 
len ratingfive Makes it nice to share project work with one another 
len ratingfive My only beef with it is the limited space for free 
len ratingfive  gb is not enough 
len ratingfive Other than that it s GOOD 
len ratingfive Muy buena app muy til para el almacenamiento de archivos
len ratingfive Cool app 
len ratingfive It is fast and easy to transfer and download 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Helps me read on the plane
len ratingfive Finally found a way to transfer my photos easily between my iPod iPhone Android tablet and PC using Windows 
len ratingfour Google drive is amazing We get access to all our files and also make them offline cool There is a problem as we cannot edit on drive itself You have to get another app to do that
len ratingfive Follow Me On Instagram ddh quan For real hip hop music Exclusive content
len ratingfour Very convenient 
len ratingfive Works easily and works well 
len ratingfive Can t ask for anything more than that 
len ratingfive Really useful 
len ratingfive Easy to use and rarely crashes 
len ratingfive Great place to keep all of my documents on my phone or iPad 
len ratingfive Having Google Drive on my iPhone is the best 
len ratingfive I can be away from my computer and be on the road and get to all my files instantly 
len ratingone I would like to encourage all who have experienced the same troubles to write a similar review 
len ratingone I will change this rating when Apple Google or Amazon shows an attempt to understand this situation 
len ratingone My concern is not limited to Apple infrastructure but also Amazon and Google 
len ratingone This limited functionality is a very unfair business practice who are you to tell me what hardware i should use to access the internet or view my PURCHASED content 
len ratingone Whenever i purchased a sony dvd took it home and hooked it up to my TV 
len ratingone Believe it or not it actually plays DVDs that aren t produced by SONY studios 
len ratingone How is it not a monopoly to produce a product that only performs the functions advertised when used on a platform it chooses 
len ratingone Would you buy a car that only works at one gas station 
len ratingone I don t know if its Google Amazon Apple or all that is doing this but I m awfully tired of customers being the last voice in the products they get to use 
len ratingone Get over it 
len ratingone I should be able to access my purchased digital media from whatever device I choose and look at all of it in the same library regardless of where i bout it 
len ratingone I should also be able to access my digital files and document using their proper functions regardless of what device I m using and what cloud i save too 
len ratingone MY HARDWARE SHOULD NOT BE CONTROLLING WHAT DATA I DECIDE TO KEEP 
len ratingone Google Office products should have full functions on Apple and Amazon products 
len ratingone Likewise ITunes files should be able to be used on Amazon and Google products 
len ratingone Let your consumers control the property they purchase 
len ratingone Why is that a bad thing 
len ratingone Oh and why can we not rate and review apple apps on the App Store 
len ratingone You would think a company would want their customers to be able to share their opinions on its products with each other 
len ratingone I m hoping that s just a glitch with my iPad because if not that s pretty shady 
len ratingtwo Can t find stuff 
len ratingtwo Maybe when I figure out this non standard navigation I will give a better rating 
len ratingfive I have been using google drive since it was created 
len ratingfive It gets better and better as the time goes with all the new features that are being added 
len ratingfive Seamless fluid and easy to use 
len ratingtwo Will not let me download 
len ratingfive Google offers fantastic products and Drive is one of my favorites 
len ratingfive It gives the ability to easily share files and works wonderfully with other Google apps 
len ratingfive I have a lot of family with a lot of documents and this app allows for easy sharing and storage without having to carry around external storage hardware 
len ratingfive It makes family organization and mom life simpler 
len ratingfive It s a little thing that makes a big difference 
len ratingfive Love Google drive 
len ratingfive Can t believe all this time I was reluctant to use a cloud service for my document except for my iPhone back up 
len ratingfive Google drive makes my life a lot easier and stress free when it comes to keeping copies of documents most importantly having acces to them from virtually anywhere 
len ratingfive Try it if your not using it you ll love it 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingthree When can we expect drag and drop feature to be available 
len ratingthree Other then that it s a great app 
len ratingfour This app took several seconds of my precious time to download and it doesn t even do everything I want 
len ratingfour Plus the stuff it does do isn t easy enough and overall it s just not perfect in many ways 
len ratingfour First it needs all kinds of instructions from me to do ANYthing 
len ratingfour I have to tell it what files to put where and I don t have time for all that why can t it just know what I want and do it 
len ratingfour Even when I finally gave in and learned how to turn it on it only seems to let you store access files that s it 
len ratingfour Exactly what the description says is all you get like they just wanted to do the bare minimum and still expect me to be satisfied 
len ratingfour Also as other reviews say the security is a joke 
len ratingfour It used to have passcode or fingerprint lock which was stupid because I always forgot my code and chew my fingers too much 
len ratingfour But instead of fixing that so it worked for me they just removed security entirely 
len ratingfour Now whenever I allow prolonged use of my phone by unsupervised young children Drive is wide open 
len ratingfour So little kids could easily be exposed to my huge collection of incredibly obscene material and I m powerless to protect them all because this app decided to cut corners that s just shameful 
len ratingfour Worst of all though is how the app refuses to improve 
len ratingfour I ve given it detailed instructions via voice command yet it never complies 
len ratingfour I even got desperate and sent several profanity laden emails to Google and still nothing happens 
len ratingfour The app won t walk my dog won t do my laundry and can t even give me a massage 
len ratingfour I mean what s the point even 
len ratingfour Sure the app does all it claims to and costs nothing 
len ratingfour Still I took the time to download it so the developers owe me more than that 
len ratingfour I m usually pretty laid back but somebody has to take a stand 
len ratingfour Until this app is perfectly tailored to my every desire like it should be I refuse to rate it a full five stars 
len ratingfour That oughta get their attention 
len ratingfive See above 
len ratingfive Love this app easy to use reliable and most important fast upload and downloads 
len ratingfour I ve used drive for a while now I use it for almost everything 
len ratingfour It s great to have all of my documents and pictures organized in one place I d only ever have one complaint 
len ratingfour Personally I ve had pictures become corrupted in the sense that they were drastically reduced in size and pixelated when I try to retrieve them at a later date 
len ratingfour This may have been a one time bug or glitch however I thought it necessary to include in an otherwise fantastic app 
len ratingfive I ve used Drive since its inception 
len ratingfive Google love all Google products 
len ratingfive Try it 
len ratingfive You ll like it 
len ratingthree Fix it
len ratingfive Great way to safely keep up with pictures and videos
len ratingfive I ve had this up for a very long time and I m very satisfied with the benefits of having it 
len ratingfive Great app with decent storage 
len ratingfive I like how switching between various file types is seamless 
len ratingfive I can open a google spreadsheet and edit without having to prompt the Open in Sheets message 
len ratingfive Soo good it s helpful a future Microsoft thing 
len ratingfive I m loving the easiness and organization
len ratingfive I love Google Drive best cloud storage
len ratingfive Best price 
len ratingfive I really like DRIVE thanks google
len ratingfour The app is amazing for everything I need in my school and work career 
len ratingfour Absolutely love the ability to pull up any of my files on anything that can log on to drive 
len ratingfour Even the ability to pull up my files without internet on preloaded devises 
len ratingfour However for the sake of the app there could stand to be some tweaking on the side of pulling up the uneatable image of some files 
len ratingfour It doesn t always come out formatted how it should 
len ratingfour Mainly for excel and PowerPoint files 
len ratingfive Works really well and meets all my organizational needs 
len ratingfive Love this app and the ability to work on my phone 
len ratingfive Best cloud file app ever
len ratingfive great app 
len ratingfive have not had any issues 
len ratingfive Terrific for backing up photos and videos 
len ratingfive If you have multiple office locations and need documents on the run Google Drive works better 
len ratingfive Always fast access and available on every device 
len ratingfive Thank you and there is no worry of going over any limits that you have to choose which files needed saving like I ICloud 
len ratingfive You can save and relax and go back later and throw files not needed other than given an option to buy more space in order to save files 
len ratingfive Easy to use and always available 
len ratingfive I use it to save my files from any device it is very convenient because I can access from anywhere 
len ratingone I need an app to make it super fast to share a video 
len ratingone I don t want to tag label it or or give a title or description or category like on YouTube I just want to send a large video to a friend with no fuss 
len ratingfive Great way to save pictures and videos to your phone
len ratingfive I needed transfer some videos 
len ratingfive All had to was export and copy to google drive 
len ratingfive Google
len ratingfive I love drive 
len ratingfive It is a safe place to store your files and is nor completely compatible with touchscreen devices 
len ratingfive At home the office the studio at the park in the woods on the water or in a far away land on the other side of the earth it s accessible anywhere and just as you left it 
len ratingfive I like the app and I wish there would be an update to add more features like a new version but I can t use it on my iPad very well 
len ratingthree I downloaded this so I could easily get on the team drive and make changes on the go for urgent matters where I don t have time to grab my laptop however this app doesn t have the option to get to team drive which is very disappointing 
len ratingfour I am able to use this across my devices 
len ratingfour It makes my life easy 
len ratingfour I sometimes just have to figure out the next step but it s very useful 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingthree Allow documents and folders to be downloaded to the device being used and moved to another account 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive So helpful and very cohesive 
len ratingfive Flawless 
len ratingfive Used for a year so far 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive Very good tool for managing social media post
len ratingfive This app is amazing and handy
len ratingthree I think file navigation can be improved by automatically open the file drop down on the left hand menu whenever you select a file from the main window as I use a lot of sub folders 
len ratingthree Also it should be easier to have a file accessed from multiple folders similar to the folder file shortcut function in windows 
len ratingfive Google Drive works really well and is very easy to use 
len ratingfive Sending large files by email could not be easier 
len ratingfive Easy to use connects to all my devices and shares info with devices and friends 
len ratingfive Awesome app got me out of trouble 
len ratingone Google drive is the most slower app I ve ever seen I m using iPhone s and I upload a seconds video after upload I cannot play the video 
len ratingone I m so disappointed Not recommended
len ratingfive I use it every day is a great app 
len ratingfive I ve never had any issues moving files around with this amazing app 
len ratingfive I can comment edit and request a student s input from anywhere 
len ratingfive Teaching writing is easier because of google docs 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive MGG
len ratingfive Not sure how this is free but I ll take it 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive App is great 
len ratingfive Little to no glitches 
len ratingfive Works very well 
len ratingfive Works across many platforms 
len ratingfive I use it for all my docs when sharing with family and for business related work 
len ratingfour Excelente aplicaci n 
len ratingfour J Reza H
len ratingfive Very good 
len ratingfive I use it daily and for my simple file sharing needs it s perfect 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingthree I have trouble saving photos from drive onto my phone 
len ratingthree there is the option to hold the photo and save to the camera roll but nothing ever shows up 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingone Google will show you what it wants you to see 
len ratingone They will try to control you and you research 
len ratingone They know where you go and they see you went you ve been good or bad 
len ratingone Just as Santa google is there 
len ratingone To know everything about you and sell it 
len ratingfive It s fantastic being able to access the drive from anywhere and being able to share documents with anyone 
len ratingone GD is compressing my photo quality dramatically with the recent update and it is stopping productivity in my business 
len ratingone Google needs to figure out a way to make entire folders available offline 
len ratingone I can t believe it s been years that the app exists and they still didn t realize some people need it 
len ratingone I want to have my photo folders available offline for the love of g 
len ratingfive Generous storage space reliable easy to use 
len ratingfive Google docs are easy to use and do not count against storage limits 
len ratingfive I am a photographer and the google drive is far easier than drop box or any other sharing technology 
len ratingfive With the iPhone interface it is easier place to store and send invitations to share my photography work 
len ratingfive It is the easiest method by far 
len ratingfive  UI 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive Puts everything you need where and when you need it 
len ratingfive I will use this constanly
len ratingfive Truly an educational need 
len ratingfive  I like it
len ratingone Video uploaded is not loading
len ratingfive I love drive 
len ratingfive I have been using it for years and I am very please 
len ratingtwo Not very easy to figure out how to share files from this app 
len ratingone The drive takes too long to update and open files 
len ratingone Ughhh 
len ratingfive This app and the website too of course is amazing 
len ratingfive You can create and easily organize docs word slides PowerPoint sheets excel and others with Drive 
len ratingfive It s not only for creating files either 
len ratingfive You can upload files of any type from your computer or device 
len ratingfive Office files can instantly be converted to Drive files too 
len ratingfive Plus add ons can help you modify files even more effectively 
len ratingfive And Drive can be accessed anywhere 
len ratingfive It s great for moving files cross platform 
len ratingfive Files can also be shared with other users easily for live up to date collaboration 
len ratingfive And it s linked to a gmail account but that s another story 
len ratingfive If the free GB of data isn t enough for you you can always pay for more 
len ratingfive Overall I find this app incredibly useful and strongly recommend it if you need free storage space 
len ratingone Can t find out how to get to synced files from mobile
len ratingfive So helpful for accessing work documents on the go 
len ratingfive This is a great way to access google drive 
len ratingfive I like the flexibility with the drive and the ability to share documents with others without having to email the document 
len ratingfive  love the app
len ratingfour The app would be stars however moving pictures between gmail accounts seems to be a chore 
len ratingfour There s no easy way to do so without saving it somewhere else only to upload the same photos to another gmail account 
len ratingfive Easy to use help is great someone is always there to walk you through something if you find yourself painted in a corner yeah been there done that twice cuz it was just so fun the first time I just couldn t help myself the second time around 
len ratingfive Seriously though the support is great and does not do any of that techy belittling talk that you can sometimes run into these folks get it and are soooo patient 
len ratingfive Oh My Goodness 
len ratingfive I don t know how these folks remain calm on the other line I mean if I were them talking to me sometimes well it s probably why I m not in that line of work for soon I d need a glass of wine after each caller like me 
len ratingtwo If you upload hundreds of megs or gigs look for another solution 
len ratingtwo I ve tried every suggestion to speed things up but nothing has worked 
len ratingtwo  megs can take an hour or more on a high speed fiber optic line 
len ratingtwo Bottleneck is definitely on Google s end 
len ratingtwo I paid for a year but will be changing to another solution unless things improve radically 
len ratingfive I can use this app to do all of my home work 
len ratingfive If the google drive didn t exist I don t think I would either 
len ratingfive I mean let s be real my whole life is embedded within the apps 
len ratingfive I couldn t get things done with such ease if it weren t for google and it s application s tools 
len ratingfive We re easy to view and share with our guest bcuz our photographer used google drive 
len ratingfive So easy 
len ratingfive We LOVE IT 
len ratingthree The app is okay 
len ratingthree It s not very smart that you have to download five separate apps to actually edit forms or sheets 
len ratingthree That s the only reason I deleted it 
len ratingthree I don t want to just look at it but I don t want five separate apps on my phone for google drive 
len ratingone Rated one star for constant review nagging 
len ratingone Here you go 
len ratingone The rest of the product is okay 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive This is a fantastic app especially with all the spreadsheet word processing functionality add on 
len ratingfive Love having the ability to utilize a cloud system that is easy and user friendly 
len ratingfive App is awesome easy to use syncs great for easy access to all documents from all your devices 
len ratingone Can t play mp video files online 
len ratingone The same problem exists in both mobile phones and computers 
len ratingfive Free hard drive space 
len ratingfive What s not to like 
len ratingfive Critical for both 
len ratingfive I can save all of my work and check it all and go back to it whenever I want to with the google drive app 
len ratingfive Especially awesome for when I need to review videos and documents 
len ratingfive This app will definitely help you if you re looking for a way to organize all of your documents in one system 
len ratingfive Having all of your documents right at your fingertips definitely helps you with your school work or presentations 
len ratingfive With features like Google Slides and Google Sheets this app allows you to do almost anything like finances taxes or even recording passwords 
len ratingfive Definitely recommend this app 
len ratingfive Great storage space 
len ratingfive Works flawlessly 
len ratingfive Integrates with all devices android and os 
len ratingfive I can do anything
len ratingthree I notice that many item present on my Drive appear in an improper aspect 
len ratingthree Often I have to hold my phone upside down or sideways to look at them properly 
len ratingthree Can this be straightened out 
len ratingfive Used for a lot of different files types 
len ratingfive Sharing was easy 
len ratingfive Would recommend 
len ratingfive Happy with this app
len ratingfive This is a great group project tools box 
len ratingfive It is not just a information cloud storage place also a efficient coworker desk 
len ratingfive I love using Google drive to upload store my photos because my iCloud has never worked and I always have a constant fear of losing all my photos 
len ratingfive This app lets me upload the photos quickly and easily 
len ratingfive nice
len ratingthree Some part is don t understand After I write done log of can t find it back by the way they said is good 
len ratingthree Thank you
len ratingone  I enjoy the constant exiting
len ratingfive Works great very dependable 
len ratingfive No problems 
len ratingfive Use app and desktop version
len ratingfive I have come around to the user interface and streamlined functionality 
len ratingfive I generally have the tools I need and rarely encounter unexpected behavior 
len ratingfive The auto save that works continually every time you change a single character and the syncing versioning functionality are two of my favorite pieces of functionality with Drive 
len ratingfive I also really enjoy being able to create tasks within documents for other users that they can respond to or mark as complete 
len ratingfive Easy to use update and collaborate across devices and teams 
len ratingfive Recommended 
len ratingfive So convenient to access all of my info anywhere there s internet 
len ratingfive Very helpful for a working intern 
len ratingfive Great service for free but for how long 
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingfive Great deal
len ratingfive Easy and amazing
len ratingfive I would recommend to anyone looking for a personal cloud storage solution 
len ratingone As title
len ratingfive Google drive is so well integrated with gmail Chrome etc 
len ratingfive that I use it for of my work 
len ratingfive I ve been using it faithfully for many years 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive It s wonderful 
len ratingfive I haven t really found a negative for it 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Can t complain about it 
len ratingfive Works fine 
len ratingfive I love google drive because it really allows me to make learning fun for me and my friends also unlike other apps you can make any kind of designs to your text 
len ratingfive I use this app for library making paragraphs about tornado facts also for my narrative text of mummies national park brochure paragraphs about Africa and now I am working on my page about Taylor Swift 
len ratingfive In conclusion I think Google Drive should be used all around the world to make learning FUN 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone C mon do not pop up a please review dialogue that obscures what I am doing 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive It s nice to have access to everything and to be able to get at it anywhere 
len ratingfive I use this for EVERYTHING 
len ratingfive It s and I need and love Google Drive 
len ratingfive Drive is awesome 
len ratingtwo  Creating a new file in Drive via Files opening in place and saving to Drive via Files work not at all or very unreliably 
len ratingtwo I need to ability to create new files in Drive editing existing files to drive and save files to Drive all using the standard system Files interface not Drive s weird proprietary thing which few apps support anyway 
len ratingtwo But to name just two problems I am not able to open an OmniOutliner document from OmniOutliner that is stored on Google Drive and attempting to create a new document on Drive via IA Writer or Textor or Pages just fails with a message about a missing helper application 
len ratingtwo The Files system makes the iPad nearly as capable as a desktop computer when it comes to file organization and grouping data from different applications together but only if third party storage providers properly use it 
len ratingtwo As it stands the most capable and least buggy options are Dropbox and iCloud Drive 
len ratingfive Really useful 
len ratingfive I enjoy google drive and will enjoy using it in the future 
len ratingfive Works flawlessly very handy and simple to use
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive I can t live without Google Drive 
len ratingone Not sure why google can t fix this app 
len ratingone The app hijacks the files app in IOS and it s been this way for months 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive It is easy to use
len ratingfive  Drive
len ratingfive No need to carry a flash drive 
len ratingfive This amazing app goes with you everywhere

len ratingfive Use it for my music transferring 
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive Drive has made life so much easier 
len ratingfive It makes my life much easier and is so convenient 
len ratingfive Thanks google for this app 
len ratingfive I feel so much more confident knowing that I m able to back all of my pictures videos without losing them or trashing them because I ran out of room 
len ratingfive And I m very happy to know that Google Drive offers additional storage space starting from and up 
len ratingfive That s great for me if I need more space 
len ratingtwo Was going smoothly until about weeks ago my Google drive folder btw my app and laptop stopped syncing and cannot figure out how or why now I can only back up the laptop folder and have to access if from a different fold within the mobile apps and it s a headache bcuz now I may have an updated file and old file with same name 
len ratingtwo Up until that it was great 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfive This cloud storage feature is as intuitive and user friendly as anyone could hope for 
len ratingfive A across the board 
len ratingfive Love it how I can access all my content from upgraded phone and so on 
len ratingfive Very convenient
len ratingfive Rather handy once you get use to it learn it 
len ratingfive Then it s full Fun 
len ratingfive It works well on my iPad 
len ratingfive I like how it organizes my files and it it s easy to send a copy to any email 
len ratingfive I also love to use it to create documents on the computer 
len ratingfive The iPad version doesn t have this tool yet 
len ratingfive  Get it 
len ratingfive Could not do my job without it 
len ratingfive This is a really nice option to use with multiple computers especially if you are interested in distancing your self from MS as much as possible 
len ratingfive All the recent mandatory MS updates have caused all sorts of chaos for me 
len ratingfive Now I am trying to distance myself as much as I can from MS
len ratingfive Guarda todo en un solo sitio
len ratingone After recent updates app isn t synchronizing multiple files and folders showing an incomplete list of items on my drive and refusing to allow me to move files and folders 
len ratingone Great app became a piece of junk overnight 
len ratingone  star is generous 
len ratingfive Great app for my iPhone X
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfive My nine year old uses it to write screenplays 
len ratingtwo I love Google and Google Drive 
len ratingtwo I use it for everything I own a chromebook 
len ratingtwo But this app barely works on an iPhone 
len ratingtwo Photos rarely manage to load over data 
len ratingtwo If you want to even look at docs and sheets you have to have those separate apps installed 
len ratingtwo The whole thing is insanely slow 
len ratingtwo I m pretty disappointed in this app and try to use it as little as possible 
len ratingfive Dab 
len ratingfive One of my favorite apps thanks google
len ratingfive Very Nice
len ratingone It s terrible 
len ratingfive Yep

len ratingone I downloaded the Google Drive set up the Settings wrong and the drive filled up and automatically started asking me for money to increase the size 
len ratingone When I went back to change the settings I couldn t find the page 
len ratingfive It works 
len ratingfive No issues 
len ratingfive I love when things just work 
len ratingfive I ve always enjoyed google drive because it s an efficient way to store files with a bunch of free storage but I was truly impressed when I tried to play a wav music file with my primary music app and after failing to do so found out that google drive was able to

len ratingfive Definitely a life saver for the working professional 
len ratingfive  Great synchronized functions which interface other mobile applications

len ratingthree Nuttz
len ratingone We switched from Dropbox 
len ratingone Google drive is slow and has mysterious propagation delays that are poorly documented 
len ratingone Escalated support said the delays can last up to a week before files are visible 
len ratingone A week from movement to google drive before all users in our company can see files 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingfive I have come to appreciate the value of this application 
len ratingfive I use it both personally and professionally 
len ratingfive It drastically has cut down on the need for hard copies for me seeing that paper is my nemesis this awesome 
len ratingfive Plus it s super easy to complete docs then return to whomever is waiting for them 
len ratingfive The e sign feature is great it also saves on ink 
len ratingfive  winning I especially love it for communicating with my kids school especially since there s a form for everything

len ratingfive Fast is all I want 
len ratingfour Iv been using google drive and dropbox for a while and ima have to say they both have there ups and downs 
len ratingfour Google offers allot of free space witch I love 
len ratingfour But for me as an animator I upload allot of videos 
len ratingfour So when trying to relay one video from one device to the next I can t do it immediately due to processing time 
len ratingfour Dropbox however offerers allot less space but uploads are quick with no processing time for videos 
len ratingfive App makes it so convenient to work from your mobile phone 
len ratingfive F cil y de r pido acceso 
len ratingfive Here is where I keep my photos organized into categories 
len ratingfive It is easier to look for a wanted photo through a small group of related photos that it is to look through a large group grouped by date 
len ratingfive This app is easy to use too 
len ratingfive I am happy with it 
len ratingfive  Me encanta esta app 
len ratingfive Siempre la uso y me es de gran utilidad

len ratingfive Enjoy 
len ratingfive Tuy t v i
len ratingfive  Good good 
len ratingfive Thank you for being voiceover accessible 
len ratingfive Please keep up the good work 
len ratingone Tried four times to scan a receipt using my iPhone to attach to an email 
len ratingone Never did work 
len ratingfive So easy to keep track of documents that I can just print later 
len ratingfive Just save it to the drive for later 
len ratingfive Greatly versatile and useful tool 
len ratingfive I really like drive 
len ratingfive It holds my videos so I can watch it on all my devices 
len ratingfive It s really good my guy 
len ratingfive I like how I can store my photos in here for free 
len ratingfive Drive is the best cloud sevice I have used 
len ratingfive It is easy to access from all my devices iPhone iPad desktop PC laptop PC 
len ratingfive I use it every day 
len ratingfive The ease of interface with all the Google apps out performs most other suites 
len ratingfive It s great when I have to attach or modify a product with my work team 
len ratingfour I use it a lot to load and save my work picture
len ratingfive bb
len ratingfive As a technology manager who has worked with many audiences I am especially thankful for tools that offer collaborative capabilities with such little complication 
len ratingfive Many times I have encountered clients who are reluctant to learn new processes not always because the are stubborn as management insists but simply because of the learning curve and the instability of the new system 
len ratingfive It s nice to be able to recommend something that once they try is honestly something they pick up immediately and WANT to use 
len ratingfive works everytime as expected worldwide acceptance and ease of use counting on the security of a large leader 
len ratingfive I m using it on my IPhone and no problem 
len ratingfive A little fiddle to work out but works
len ratingfive I love the convenience of being able to work on it wherever I go without having to log in and off 
len ratingfive Great options and so easy to use 
len ratingthree I love Google Drive and I use it s consistently for work 
len ratingthree On my computer it works fantastically 
len ratingthree This app isn t nearly as good specifically when it comes to video which is about of my job 
len ratingthree Regardless if I m on cellular data or WiFi they simply don t load properly 
len ratingfive Great for projects slideshows anything 
len ratingfive It s been a game changer for me 
len ratingfive I use these tools for virtually all of my professional personal and volunteer projects now from tracking treasurer expenses to writing my novel s 
len ratingfive Having everything easily and instantly available for simultaneous editing on each of my devices at once has been a dream come true 
len ratingfive Compared to other apps 
len ratingfive The only other similar app I also use is Box and Google apps works much more smoothly 
len ratingfive Though Box works directly with Microsoft apps which have many more features Microsoft s online apps are SLOW to load and that would make the fast start and instant access I m gushing about in the previous paragraph impossible if I tried to use Box in the same way 
len ratingfive I would presume Dropbox has a similar suite of fast access apps but I ve never tried any others but Google docs so I can t compare 
len ratingfive  Wonderful and distinctive
len ratingfive I never had any issues 
len ratingfive Works the way it needs to 
len ratingfive I absolutely love it 
len ratingfive I can share with others and we can work at the same time on projects 
len ratingfive I m use It often and share files easily 
len ratingfive Awesome tool
len ratingone Very slow during opening
len ratingfive Can get to important documents at any time 
len ratingfive Great cloud storage system syncs really well with laptop and desk top
len ratingfive Works great thank you
len ratingfour Google drive works very well and makes working on one project on multiple computers easy 
len ratingfour Also the document editors are rather good especially when doing collaboration 
len ratingfour Two small nitpicks Is drive content encrypted at google server 
len ratingfour This is not clear cannot find any answer anywhere 
len ratingfour I am a software developer and had a few Angular projects in my drive 
len ratingfour Because of the large number of files contained in these projects google drive can get pretty stuck in syncing the files 
len ratingfour However I was able to recover simply by starting with a clean folder and syncing only what I needed 
len ratingfour I think the problem is more with Angular than google drive but it is something to keep in mind if you want to use it for angular projects have switched to using git now 
len ratingfive best in world
len ratingone Won t let me download anything to post on social media
len ratingfive Great application
len ratingfive BOOYA 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive Great for apple products 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive I save all my lecture notes essays and my resume on this app

len ratingfive  Hi
len ratingfive Love that I can get to it from anywhere and can use it everywhere 
len ratingfive Makes my life way easier

len ratingtwo I will leave Star when the Pin Security Login added back to the App 
len ratingfour Google drive is a great productivity app to keep us organized however that s the ironic part 
len ratingfour If we could organize our files in a specific order that would be amazingly helpful 
len ratingfour There aren t options to customize the order or rearrange files within drive or in a specific folder 
len ratingfive So cool
len ratingfive  Already enjoying the benefit of Google Drive 
len ratingfive It is very useful 
len ratingfive It makes you ver mobile 
len ratingfive I like google drive easy to use and access 
len ratingfour Works well on multiple platforms 
len ratingfive This is a very handy utility Having the power to write endlessly offline across devices that is my reason for enjoying this app 
len ratingfive It has many other features of an office app and storing documents and photos 
len ratingfive All the power of dropbox and the power to manipulate items without need for another app 
len ratingfive It is nice to embrace the utility that should have been on iPhone from the start 
len ratingfive Now you can make to do lists across devices without needing apps 
len ratingfive Really this app is very powerful considering how limiting the device has been for years 
len ratingfive Simple necessary features have LONG been missing 
len ratingfive Especially in the photo department 
len ratingfive Drive is compensating for the lack of attention in these vital areas 
len ratingfive The iPhone is about a lot more than Facebook and it s very unfortunate that it now apparently incorporates that focus above intuitive utility having a powerful device in the hand now used for wanton apps like Facebook
len ratingfive I use all the time I love it
len ratingfive So easy to use and organize
len ratingfive It is good for the most part I ve been using it to store my storage if my iPhone runs out of photos I can upload photos and delete all of mine but I ve been having this problem when I am trying to upload photos it rather blacks out and goes to my home screen btw my phone dies fast but I m usually at or it just doesn t upload and I don t like it 
len ratingfive Can somebody fix this bug 
len ratingone It is useless it makes my HW let
len ratingfive Muy buena aplicaci n 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I recommend this app to anyone looking to share and take documents with them wherever they go

len ratingfive Works flawlessly 
len ratingfive Does everything as it should 
len ratingfive Can access and share files easily 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is amazing 
len ratingfive It saves all your documents pictures smlideshows and so much more 
len ratingfive Recommended 
len ratingfive I use Google drive for all of my cloud storage needs and it s never failed to deliver optimal performance 
len ratingfive It s intuitive easy to access secure and I m never without access to my files 
len ratingfive I ve used other very good cloud storage services but I always come back to drive because it simply works 
len ratingfive I recommend it to my friends and colleagues and I ve never had them report a problem with the service 
len ratingfive I can extend my recommendation to you as well and I m confident that you won t be disappointed 
len ratingfive If anyone can point me to a superior alternative I m certainly open to trying it 
len ratingfive Kudos to the developers and to Google as well I m a very satisfied customer 
len ratingfive So fun to write with 
len ratingfive I love google drive so much and it makes schoolwork easy to finish so you can move on to writing amazing stories Google Drive will definitely boost the creativity of anyone who gets it

len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingfive It s GOOD BECAUSE ME CAN NOW MAJE YOUTUBE VIDEO
len ratingthree Before the recent updates I would ve given this app five stars 
len ratingthree My issues with it now are as follows 
len ratingthree The passcode lock getting taken off 
len ratingthree I m truly curious why it s no longer even an option to have a lock on an account 
len ratingthree How long it takes to move a document to a folder 
len ratingthree As someone who likes to organize I have many folders within folders within folders 
len ratingthree As of the recent updates when moving a document it takes forever after clicking on one folder for the next screen of documents to pop up so I can then click on another folder and so on 
len ratingthree The weirdness of the search feature 
len ratingthree If I m looking for a doc by title it always comes up as the sixth or seventh doc down but most of the time the search feature is incredibly accurate and helpful 
len ratingthree Overall I still consider this app extremely useful and how frequently I use it won t in any way be changed 
len ratingthree I hope the developers do look into these issues though 
len ratingfive I can look up the documents I put on it if I don t have my originals with me 
len ratingfive It s quick and easy to get to instead of having to call someone to find the copy I need and fax it to where I m at 
len ratingfive I use this mostly for storing pictures on the go which helps not clog up my phone storage 
len ratingfive Love that you can also place any other large files so easily 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive The go to app 
len ratingfive Great App easy to use and reliable

len ratingfive  g
len ratingfive Google Drive is an easy to use go to for pinch data storage or sharing with others 
len ratingfive Would I suggest putting PII or greater security required data here not really

len ratingfive Google drive makes it easy for us to share and store 
len ratingfive All I need to keep all my files available off hand very quickly and organized

len ratingone I downloaded Google Chrome App and I also downloaded Google Drive App yet I cannot edit a Google doc but only view it 
len ratingone The app is helpless and doesn t do much for the edit ability to a document no keyboard access either 
len ratingone The Google Drive app is telling me I need to download two separate and different Google apps 
len ratingone No thank you 
len ratingone If it takes separate apps to do one task then I don t need that kind of clutter on my phone 
len ratingfive Easy to use and free

len ratingfive Great for everything
len ratingthree  Atende muito bem as expectativas 
len ratingthree Os problemas de n o atualizar arquivos no drive n o existe 
len ratingthree Ainda persiste o problema de atualizar a data de modifica o quando ainda o app est aberto 
len ratingtwo  Experience is very poor compared to the android counterpart of Google Drive 
len ratingtwo Continuous crash in the notification section 
len ratingtwo Simply terrible 
len ratingfive Say it s success is dependent upon server or is So google would make ya Believe they have one up on everybody else 
len ratingfive And they should have one up then everybody else because they been around so long and if you seen all the infrastructure and the underpinnings and me in the network that makes things go around so as a drive for you wanna put your stuff there s got to be Solid and not going to float away during a big storm so Google drive that was a virtual drive and as of that virtual drive it s not anything that you can well if that s ever goes away so drive and that s the hard part about it because if you don t give a look up in your system you don t know what do you have any of the right availability of actually seeing it that creates two problems one the actual space with your hard drive we have to exist for you to have a double drives and to the sink properties it would belong to those documents on your hard drive versus those that are out there in the cloud or in a drive but on a cloud so those are the complicating to happen there in the summer hard and fast rules about that and some different lip service levels of agreements that are now part of the Infrastructure in progress 
len ratingfive  I just love the product and have always been happy using the Drive Maps and email 
len ratingfive I Alia love the google doodles fun stuff
len ratingfive You can look at your other devices all from the Google Drive

len ratingthree Not helpful 
len ratingfive Very useful on a run 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive This makes it easy to do projects papers or essays when you don t have a chrome book on hand or a computer at your house 
len ratingfive This just proves that Google helps people in many ways and we only have to use one of those ways for a great results 
len ratingthree I d give it But unless you compress and ZIP up your video files the larger ones don t download 
len ratingthree The interface for getting something offline and onto your phone for times where there is no internet is way off base

len ratingthree Cheers
len ratingfive Very nice 
len ratingfive Helps keep all of your items from Google in one place and can be used on an iPhone iPad or whatever you have 
len ratingfive Great work from Google and Apple to download it 
len ratingfive This app is better than to go on the computer find your stuff 
len ratingfive One thing I highly recommend is to update your options if layouts 
len ratingfive I use this for school and my other email as well 
len ratingfive It s organized easy to use and overall great 
len ratingfive Only a few things however I was a little taken aback when I found that you had to get the other apps to view certain things such as documents and slide presentations 
len ratingfive The second and last thing I wanted to mention was the problem with certain files being unsupported in drive 
len ratingfive I tried to download a music file and it didn t work it said that the file was unsupported 
len ratingfive I was a little disappointed but I m still thoroughly enjoying my experience with the Google Drive App 
len ratingfive  D
len ratingone Can t seem to find a way to make a file public with link sharing from the drive app
len ratingthree Cant open protecteur pdf in drive

len ratingfive Since I have been using the google apps and is now an integral part of all our organizations

len ratingfive I use this at work and I work with this app everyday and everyday this app is ready for me to work it and I work it good 
len ratingfive Great app

len ratingfive Thanks for always keeping my files safe and accessible google 
len ratingfive A must have app 
len ratingfive Google drive works very well

len ratingfive I have been using google drive since at least high school if not earlier in life due to my school requiring chrome books as class material but really taught me how to use technology to my advantage at an early age

len ratingfive google drives provides just that 
len ratingfive Great hands on access to rosters agendas and much more 
len ratingfive I was able to save All my daughters Wedding Pictures on my tablet 
len ratingfive l
len ratingfive Love sharing documents
len ratingone Is there a negative rating 
len ratingone Fixing bugs more like just sweeping bugs under the rug and hope no one sees them poking out 
len ratingone Still crashes can t type without it suddenly messing up 
len ratingone If I could flush it down the toilet I would but why would I even disrespect the toilet like that 
len ratingtwo Very sluggish 
len ratingtwo Going through a spreadsheet is very time consuming 
len ratingfive I love it the space 
len ratingfive Thank you Google for the convenience 
len ratingfive You didn t read that wrongly 
len ratingfive Of course every Google drive is free up to GB I upgraded to GB which is only monthly 
len ratingfive This is the shared space for all of my engineering files music and videos 
len ratingfive After downloading this get Google Photos free this is how you get unlimited space 
len ratingfive I can store HQ pics and videos on this app and it doesn t take any space 
len ratingfive Linking the apps is as simple as flipping a switch 
len ratingfive I was able to compact GB of data to my GB drive and still have GB to spare 
len ratingfour All the major cloud services Dropbox OneDrive Box and Google Drive have their pros and cons 
len ratingfour This app is very stable and reliable 
len ratingfour I m unhappy with Google for not providing programs for Linux but that s a separate question 
len ratingfive It helps me with organization 
len ratingfive I love how I can store and save just about anything and access from anywhere 
len ratingfive Very helpful tool for organizing your google drive using your phone 
len ratingfive Great for uploading files images and videos from your phone to your google drive 
len ratingone This is awful 
len ratingone I can t export any videos to my gallery what are u people even working on 
len ratingtwo  It s a solid app but I just don t trust the company with my data 
len ratingtwo There are other good secure options
len ratingfive Me salva sempre 
len ratingfive I don t know what I d do without google drive
len ratingfive Extremely convenient to access your files from phone tablet or computer 
len ratingfive I use google drive for work 
len ratingfive It s the best tool available for collaboration 
len ratingfive I m so impressed 
len ratingfive I imagine something this useful will not remain free 
len ratingfive Use it for everything pictures docs shared documents schoolwork 
len ratingfive Really great and for free 
len ratingfour I love google docs 
len ratingone Cannot open things on mobile 
len ratingthree Apparently you need to refresh in order to save your latest files other than that seems like a really good app 
len ratingfive Google Docs and Drive give me access to my writing at all times from any device regardless of where I am 
len ratingfive The ability to share access with other users is a huge help 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Love the convenience 
len ratingfive Now just getting it fully compatible with MacOS and windows
len ratingfive Thank you for making such a good app 
len ratingfive Very easy and capable cloud storage that plays nice with most software and other storage apps 
len ratingthree Idk it s like kinda crappy but it s useable
len ratingone They took away the passcode protect feature now I can t secure my files

len ratingfive I love google drive and use it for all my documents 
len ratingfive It is convenient on ever device and great for collaborative documents with friends 
len ratingfive Of course when I say I couldn t live without it I mean it figuratively not literally but really I use it so often and it works so seamlessly accolades just don t accurately describe the app 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  So convenient and easy to use
len ratingfive Easily view non critical files like photos music documents that don t have account numbers or other critical or sensitive information 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this app 
len ratingfour After I opened some files pdf and wanted to export them It showed loading popup and took some time to export to another apps which I think is not necessary because I had downloaded the files to view in the drive 
len ratingfour But the rest are awesome
len ratingfive Awesome calendar app 
len ratingfive Love that you can add reminders and add multiple reminder notifications to events 
len ratingfive The ability to be able to attach a file to an event is great 
len ratingfive Overall interface both in chrome browser and in app on iPhone iPad excellent 
len ratingfive Useful and easy to use

len ratingfive Very reliable can t live without it
len ratingfive Great for individuals and small businesses
len ratingfive I love Drive and use it everyday as a part of my photography flow 
len ratingfive gb of storage for free is awesome 
len ratingtwo I used to use this as a great way to get media off of my phone and use it in chrome book 
len ratingtwo Lately it either doesn t want to upload or doesn t sync properly 
len ratingfive Sweet
len ratingfour I m a user of other open source writing software 
len ratingfour As aware as I should be to save my documents as a doc format I don t always 
len ratingfour Since I don t it would be nice to see a further expansion of documents that can be read 
len ratingfour But that s just being persnickety it s a great program as a whole 
len ratingfour When I use google drive on my mobile device I expect to be able to access every file that s on my drive 
len ratingfour However I ve found that files in the hundreds of MB and larger cannot be opened either in the app or with third party apps 
len ratingfour They often cause Drive to crash even though I am using it on a brand new iPhone X 
len ratingfour If there isn t a fix for this there should at least be an explanation so I can just expect to never have access to these types of files 
len ratingfive  really good
len ratingfive I was so used to using Dropbox and this is much more user friendly and easy to follow 
len ratingfive I love to be able to have my docs online and to share them
len ratingfive This is great I can t believe I have this 
len ratingfive thanks
len ratingfive I started using it when I was studying for my masters degree 
len ratingfive My classmates and I used it for several group assignments 
len ratingfive It made communication so much easier 
len ratingfive I still use it to store various resources 
len ratingfive I love that it s right at my fingertips anytime I need it 
len ratingfive It s very useful drive Use very easy way helping every user
len ratingfive Works Great for sharing pix from our bar crawls 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree Each major concept of
len ratingone Drive has become totally useless on my plus 
len ratingone Started having streaming issues about months ago 
len ratingone Most videos won t play or stop part way through 
len ratingone I struggle to open photos most of the time 
len ratingone I don t know what happened 
len ratingone Phone has been reset 
len ratingone Completely reset to factory 
len ratingone App has been deleted more than once and reinstalled 
len ratingone Every successive update gets worse and worse 
len ratingone I really think the reason is competition 
len ratingone Regardless of the numbers of Apple users Google just doesn t care as a priority about non Android phones and making sure compatibility is there 
len ratingone These issues have been going on for so long I honestly feel like Google has just abandoned support for iPhone 
len ratingone As I was told from one Google employee Drive is not meant to stream content even though it s my own and I PAY for storage 
len ratingone It s simply meant as cloud storage 
len ratingone I have gone from limited use to now after the latest update not being able to stream any video or even open a photo from my account 
len ratingone This isn t some third party created app this is Google 
len ratingone I seriously can t understand how this is possible 
len ratingfive I m a big Apple fan but I don t think anything but google drive will ever be first in my heart 
len ratingfive I especially love the make available offline feature 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive  gggggggooooooodddddd
len ratingfive It s super good
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive Really useful I m constantly saving documents and the app is very convenient for immediate access 
len ratingfive My organization does an enormous amount on work on GDrive 
len ratingfive Google s suite of free software has been so instrumental in my small business success 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfour Love how easy it is to use and collaborate with others 
len ratingfour It is also available on all platforms 
len ratingfive The Google Drive is the best backup for my photos videos and music 
len ratingfive Is the best totally helpful 
len ratingfive I love this 
len ratingfive It s so convenient 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Very handy app to keep files in I can open them from any computer and access them by my phone 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Allows me to collaborate with folks from inside and outside of my agency
len ratingthree I save my information that I share with my husband in an excel file on google drive 
len ratingthree The system freezes up often and is not as quick as the desktop version 
len ratingthree There are also features of the desktop version that are much more user friendly 
len ratingfive Ok so I m in middle school and this app helps me keep track of all my classes and it s just very useful
len ratingfive Only improvement I can think of would be to provide more free storage 
len ratingfive The best app ever
len ratingthree Not sure what the problem is but some files don t open
len ratingfive I now pay for storage and I keep all my stuff in one place 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive This app is wonderful for sharing files and memories Family videos are uploaded and playable within the app 
len ratingfive Use it for basically everything 
len ratingfive Great interface cheap for high volume storage 
len ratingfive Use it for personal and business
len ratingfive Must listen
len ratingfive Love how easy it is to get everything to share with all my devices
len ratingfive Oh
len ratingone Such a simple action can t be done on iOS but easy peasy on Android 
len ratingone How pathetic 
len ratingfive Makes everything simple
len ratingfive We use Google Drive on a daily basis for multiple projects 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and I can always find what I need by the push of a button The two areas that are extremely helpful is keeping track of all of our listings and all of the marketing we do for all our listings 
len ratingfive We highly recommend Google Drive
len ratingfour Well good but still miss Picasa more easy 
len ratingone Used to have a security lock feature 
len ratingone Now replaced 
len ratingone Google changes up too often 
len ratingone apps often become inactive and disappear
len ratingfive There is practically nothing to improve in Google Drive but if one thing had to be changed I d make the icons of documents about half the size 
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingfive I m an audio engineer and I m always needing to upload and send files 
len ratingfive Nothing beats google drive 
len ratingfive It s simplicity and effectiveness is unmatched 
len ratingfive Oh and private and secure 
len ratingfive It s great to save all my stuff in one place 
len ratingfive Google drive is my cloud storage of choice 
len ratingfour Works better than most and despite room for improvement in search display it s still by far my fav among the apps of its kind 
len ratingthree I have always use Drive on my previous android devices and never had any problem with it 
len ratingthree But now I have an iPhone S and I need to upgrade my storage but I m not able to since I can t see the option as the Help page says 
len ratingthree I can t see any Next button at all 
len ratingthree Hi my name is Yulianna and I am planning to make videos to save for later when it will be later in my life so hope I will have a great time doing my videos and texting and filming and I will have a great time being there and I think that it is my first time of all doing this so let s get started 
len ratingfive OK so first of all this is so good for putting pictures on and getting to another device 
len ratingfive If i want to get something from my ipod to my computer i just save it on here and open it on my computer its that simple 
len ratingfive Second of all people say crap like its useless and things like that 
len ratingfive No yall just dont use it for important things 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this c 
len ratingthree Can t open any of my pics or music
len ratingone I just spent minutes trying to move a PDF attachment from an email to Google Drive and put it in a folder 
len ratingone Part of the problem is the flat file list in Drive 
len ratingone There is no hierarchy 
len ratingone The buttons are not intuitive 
len ratingone After hitting the drive icon in my email I thought it was saved to MyDrive 
len ratingone Apparently it was not it was nowhere to be found 
len ratingone I had to go to my desktop in order to save the files to MyDrive but that wasn t much easier and it certainly wasn t intuitive 
len ratingone This is an absolutely terrible product 
len ratingfive I ve never had a better roast beef sandwich anywhere in my live 
len ratingfive Just superb 
len ratingfour I still like Dropbox better I find it a little more user friendly but I m getting used to Google Drive and I really like it 
len ratingfour I would recommend it to anyone 
len ratingfour I m using an Apple iPhone iOS 
len ratingfive Great apps
len ratingfour Very helpful in the workflow
len ratingfive I m not very organized and could never find where my favorite recipes were located in my books 
len ratingfive I scanned them into google drive and now they are accessible all the time 
len ratingfive I am so happy 
len ratingfive Google drive is incredibly easy to use and provides read access to my storage from phone to home and work computer and back 
len ratingfive Know does apps you always had it never used it then life put you in a situation where you had to use it now can t live without it

len ratingfive Muy recomendable 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Google s versatility and full functionality have made so much of what I do easier 
len ratingfive Previously I used three or four different online services 
len ratingfive One service could store images 
len ratingfive Another could store text 
len ratingfive A third and fourth were used to take notes for research and compose files 
len ratingfive When I needed to compile all of the information between those different sources 
len ratingfive I would open content in one environment copy and then paste the content into a completely different environment 
len ratingfive Then have to worry about trying to remember which platform my final continent was stored on 
len ratingfive Many times I would recreate content because I couldn t find the last version of my file 
len ratingfive Or forget where a part of what I had created was located 
len ratingfive With Google s amazing features and tools I now know that everything is stored in one location 
len ratingfive I can easily work on my files in a single seamless environment 
len ratingfive You have made my processes faster and allowed me to cut unnecessary time 
len ratingfive My important storages 
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive for over three years now 
len ratingfive Whether I m working for on a document for class or something for fun Google Drive never ceases to amaze me with its organizational style and its automatic saving setting 
len ratingfive This software is very easy to use and can be accessible on the move which is very helpful for me 
len ratingfive Without Google Drive I don t know what I would do with online projects 
len ratingfive This app makes it so easy to store documents 
len ratingfive It s directly linked to everything and I m so glad I got it 
len ratingfive This app is useful for everything 
len ratingfive Mobile tablet PC works for me 
len ratingfive Systems allows a very easy way of sharing files for study or documents for group discussion

len ratingfive great
len ratingtwo Not sure who s to blame Google Drive or iAnnotate 
len ratingtwo Recently When uploading documents from iAnnotate to Google Drive the documents would not appear in Google Drive even though iAnnotate showed the documents uploaded to Google Drive 
len ratingtwo To get the documents to appear in Google Drive I have to make duplicate copies of them while in iAnnotate 
len ratingtwo After this monkey motion both the original and duplicate copy appear when I go through Google Drive to confirm they have uploaded 
len ratingtwo It was unnerving the first time this happened because I thought the documents had been lost 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingtwo Thanks
len ratingfive I have a iPhone and Android phone and I needed something that I could save instructions in and be able to pull them up at anytime on any device

len ratingone Idk if it s you
len ratingfive Just keeps getting better and better

len ratingfive I have yet to meet the circumstance that couldn t be handled by this app 
len ratingfive Home run grime google here 
len ratingfive glad to have docs easily accessible
len ratingfive Nothing like having all your documents available at your fingertips no matter where you are 
len ratingone No find in page option
len ratingfive This drive helps with keeping your important files in one place or organizing them in fewer places for quick access 
len ratingfive I use it on my Chromebook now I use it on my iPad too 
len ratingfive Now Apple office products or apps they are the best for organizing your files the very best as far as I am concern 
len ratingfive Yet the Google Drive is good to have too because nothing is worst than losing your work or files after putting in all that work 
len ratingfour Not necessarily the files themselves but the directory 
len ratingfour Just to know where things are 
len ratingfour Maybe the metadata 
len ratingfive Nice to have it available anytime I want
len ratingfive great interface always works in all my devices 
len ratingfive fast and efficient
len ratingtwo Please checkout my camera from each device and sync total the amount of my pictures and show on the pane list correct the days taken of that picture and also please help to organize my photos and videos on this account thank you very much 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingone I was using Google Drive normally when suddenly all my files were lost
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingthree Please add security back to the app as a back up or at least an option 
len ratingfive  This app is going to help me in many new and different ways 
len ratingfive I m a student and I find managing all of my work very simple with a smooth transition from my laptop to any other device through drive 
len ratingone My phone is always connected to wifi and yet this app never connects and it has had this problem for months 
len ratingone Finally deleting the app today and just downloading the google sheets app and google docs individually 
len ratingfive I love google drive awesome app Having access to my pictures in all of my devices is great and not using my iPhone memory is a plus thank u very much 
len ratingfour I like google slides because I get to be creative and make slides and show my feelings about things and why I like it

len ratingfive You can find your work easily on any device anywhere in the world 
len ratingfive So easy to navigate and keeps the inform secure 
len ratingone All these high rated rants I see on here are either fake made by ignorant people and or both NOTHING is free you Google s Sucker is what they make money from 
len ratingone Using EVERY Google product 
len ratingone Has any high ranted heard of the term encryption and secure storage 
len ratingone Find out what it is and that NOTHING Google offers has it 
len ratingone Why do you think REAL companies REFUSE to use ANYTHING from Google 
len ratingone Perfect example Google s Photo cr app do you really think any company is just going to hand you free unlimited storage just because 
len ratingone Hint everything you upload and store is scanned and analyzed by Googles various pattern analysis and image recognition systems and that data is most certainly stored 
len ratingone Now you know one of MANY reasons that NOTHING via from Google is encrypted Captain Buzzkill 
len ratingone Why do I have to log in when someone sends me a link to something on their google drive 
len ratingone Why can t I just see it 
len ratingfive Going real well seems easy to use opening all documents so far with no problems
len ratingfive Very impressive app Using both dropbox and gg drive

len ratingfive You will never lose anything and you are able to organize it in a way that you will be able to remember 
len ratingfive I Google Drive 
len ratingthree I tried to send one long seven minutes video to my friend and she told me she is not able to open it because she needs an authorization from me and I couldn t figure out How to do that I couldn t see any notification in order to give that authorization to my friend so that s why I m confused I don t know if this app is easy to use or not easy
len ratingfive Cumpre o que se prop e a cumprir
len ratingfour Can somebody make a you tube tutorial 
len ratingfive Google drive saves automatically and organizes all your stuff it is the best online program

len ratingfive Ease of use and access is great

len ratingone  Takes forever to load 
len ratingone Pulling my hair out 
len ratingone My google chrome is slow too and safari is working completely fine 
len ratingone Guess I m going to have to switch to apple safari again

len ratingfive to my group of senior citizens using Google Drive 
len ratingfive Works well with my IPad IPhone and Windows 
len ratingfive Pinacle of cloud based computing 
len ratingfive Valuable and quick 
len ratingfive Access from anywhere 
len ratingfive Thank you on behalf of humanity
len ratingfive This app is good
len ratingfive My band mates and I use it to share songs and info on upcoming gigs
len ratingone I want a refund 
len ratingone Apple charged my card for the subscription fee 
len ratingone No upgrade occurred 
len ratingone Google says Apple is the problem 
len ratingone Apple points me back to Google because it s considered a subscription 
len ratingone Google support says nope they don t see any purchase contact Apple 
len ratingone  plus tax completely wasted 
len ratingone Just give me my money back 
len ratingone Never trust purchase between competing giants 
len ratingone You the customer will likely get burned like they did to me 
len ratingfive I like the idea of the google apps being on your mobile device so you don t always have to get a computer to look at google apps 
len ratingfive With this app you can get to all of the stuff you made on google apps right on your iPhone iPad or iPod 
len ratingfive It makes life a lot easier because you can find your typed stuff easily and edit them 
len ratingfour I cannot figure out how to view shared folders 
len ratingfour They are all files too many of them all scattered 
len ratingfour In one place 
len ratingfive I love having it on all my devices and it also helps keep me organized
len ratingfive This app makes it convenient for me to transfer and share files from anywhere 
len ratingfive On my phone my iPad my laptop or my desktop everything is automatically in sync with any type of files I want to store on any of my devices 
len ratingfive All I have to do is upload from one and it s there for all 
len ratingfive I m a student 
len ratingfive That s my review bai bai random person reading this 
len ratingfive  Very easy to use love the organization of the files and storage space is perfect 
len ratingthree I was doing this video project and the software I was using was Screencastify 
len ratingthree Unfortunately you have to pay in order to trim videos 
len ratingthree My next best option was Drive but I could not find any way at all to trim the video 
len ratingthree Even in my phone 
len ratingthree After minutes of me trying to figure it out I eventually had to re record the entire thing 
len ratingthree I found this to be really annoying because possibly being the biggest tool for organization you d think they would add a trim video feature for this but no
len ratingfive Love the app great and easy to use
len ratingfive Awesome Technology 
len ratingfive It helps organize EVERYTHING 
len ratingfive You really need to download it 
len ratingfour It does what it says
len ratingfive Back up without even trying 
len ratingfive Works really well 
len ratingthree It s is Not letting me add a scan document
len ratingfive Google is awesome 
len ratingfive This app works great 
len ratingfive Great app for my lifestyle
len ratingfive Google docs slides forms sheets they are all now my go to apps 
len ratingfive Simple and clean and easy to use 
len ratingfive Sharing is the best 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Lots of storage space 
len ratingfive Works for photos and other files too 
len ratingtwo Mobile Drive s primary function is uploading and sharing 
len ratingtwo The supposed need to download other apps Docs Slides etc simply to edit and have a better handle over one s documents is ludicrous storage eating and annoying 
len ratingtwo PLEASE merge your apps into one else get rid of the Drive app entirely 
len ratingtwo There is no need to download more than apps of the same function 
len ratingtwo When accessed from a computer or laptop however Drive is truly an efficient step further into the modern age 
len ratingtwo It is the easiest and most intuitive storage and document creating app I have seen and is most of the time made good use out of 
len ratingtwo As aforementioned it is the necessity to download multiple apps which has driven me from Drive no pun intended when I m on the go 
len ratingtwo Make Drive all document inclusive as it s web counterpart or allow web Drive to be accessed fully in browser without needing to download an app 
len ratingtwo and it will become a very hefty and durable app 
len ratingtwo Until then two stars 
len ratingfive Good drive
len ratingfour It s okay but where is my car it says drive for a reason right 
len ratingfive I use it for everything at home and work 
len ratingfive It s the best 
len ratingfive I find my self working from different computers daily

len ratingfive  Simplifies documentation
len ratingfive Do you want to be useful while waiting in line 
len ratingfive Say no more 
len ratingfive Have access to all your documents on your phone 
len ratingfive It doesn t get better than that
len ratingfive A crucial aspect of my everyday work life 
len ratingfive I only wish I could do my editing within it 
len ratingone I have a S iPhone using high speed WiFi and Drive ALWAYS crashes freezes or simply will open and refuse to load anything 
len ratingone A year ago I loved the app and uploaded many pictures and files but it has recently turned useless 
len ratingone Now I have to access my files on a desktop 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfour What you would expect if you have ever used drive on the computer the only reason it is four stars instead of is because you have to download several more apps if you want to edit documents 
len ratingfive Great app to access Google Drive 
len ratingfive Works well never any issues 
len ratingfive Seamless 
len ratingfive Can t be without it 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive This is really great apps 
len ratingfive Thank you for giving us a way to store excess files and photos
len ratingfive Every version of the App keeps getting better and better 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone When I access my Google Drive app and want to access the Notifications option on the left the entire screen just goes black and the app closes 
len ratingone This continues to happen even after the App Store prompts me to update Google Drive 
len ratingone I m all ears for anyone who really knows how to fix this problem 
len ratingone I love google drive use it for work school and when I am making Lego s eat eachother

len ratingfive Yep
len ratingone What did you do

len ratingone I guess it only works with a newer phone now 
len ratingfive Used Office for years 
len ratingfive Will never use it again 
len ratingfive Entire Google platform is sooooo easy to use 
len ratingfive This works for my PCs my phones my pads google has my business for all internet storage for a long time to come 
len ratingfive Much better that other companies tools 
len ratingfive The apps let me view AND edit files on the go just about as easy as if I was at my desktop 
len ratingfive Intuitive 
len ratingfive Efficient with the user s time 
len ratingfive Well Done 
len ratingfive pretty good at keeping up with my work
len ratingfive So far I have enjoy the performance time will time
len ratingfive Perfect storage for storage 
len ratingfive I have always used google drive to upload store and share files with team members and friends

len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Love it I can edit things for school on my phone

len ratingfive Thank you Drive for making my busy life more productive 
len ratingfive Whether I am at work home traveling or just elsewhere I am able to access my folders and files work alone or with others and share with others 
len ratingfive super helpful when i don t have time to take out my computer but i need to do work 
len ratingfive would definitely recommend 
len ratingfive It is a little pretty over functional at times 
len ratingfive I cannot think of specific examples at the moment 
len ratingfive I like it so far 
len ratingfive Been using it for a couple weeks at work 
len ratingfive Syncing and updating are great 
len ratingtwo  Creating a new file in Drive via Files opening in place and saving to Drive via Files work not at all or very unreliably 
len ratingtwo I need to ability to create new files in Drive editing existing files to drive and save files to Drive all using the standard system Files interface not Drive s weird proprietary thing which few apps support anyway 
len ratingtwo But to name just two problems I am not able to open an OmniOutliner document from OmniOutliner that is stored on Google Drive and attempting to create a new document on Drive via IA Writer just fails with a message about a missing helper application 
len ratingtwo The Files system makes the iPad nearly as capable when it comes to file organization and grouping data from different applications together but only if third party storage providers properly use it 
len ratingfive  Essential to my productivity love it 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive very handy when I m taking tons of pictures and needs space
len ratingfour Good
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive  I don t know why I bothered with any other writer app doc app or computer programs for either 
len ratingfive GOOGLE HAS IT ALL 
len ratingfive The programs and or apps are so easy to use print or edit 
len ratingfive Plus I can leave one project on a device to pick up right where I left off onto another device 
len ratingfive So yes I am an Apple person who has Google everything downloaded on every device 
len ratingfive Because I am a mom of who doesn t have time for complicated 
len ratingfive Thank you Google for making my life easier 
len ratingfive  I can access all my files from anywhere

len ratingfour Very nice App 
len ratingfour Ron
len ratingone Needs to work better with a IPhone
len ratingfive I wish it would remember the last saved directory
len ratingone Every time I try to delete something I get an error message 
len ratingone And I hate the fact that you have to download the files in order to review them 
len ratingone Nothing that I m supposed to have in my drive shows up
len ratingfive Now if they would only keep from selling their souls to the government and big money 
len ratingfive That would be exceptional 
len ratingfive If they protect the people users in their terms and stay wary of corporate money I would say kudos to them Google 
len ratingfive But if they lead the fight in cutting edge technology that guarantees no govt big money corporate interference in the days and lives of users on the internet in a truly free and unfettered environment of course while still protecting users off and online then that there I would truly respect and would speak proudly of them often 
len ratingfive I would dare say live Google and promote Google 
len ratingfive Keeps me organized and professional looking 
len ratingfive I have had nothing but a pleasure using it 
len ratingfive A great way to organize my stuff 
len ratingfive I love the fact that I can save any attachments directly to my Google drive from my Gmail account and overall design for many other Google applications that most people are not aware of 
len ratingfive Google should invest in advertising these great applications 
len ratingfive At work and for all my personal stuff 
len ratingfive More and more people are using it now so you never have to worry about file formats 
len ratingfive Would recommend 
len ratingfive Google drive is great

len ratingfour Also unlike Dropbox there s no way I could figure short of pausing quitting the app then resuming restarting to sync on the fly

len ratingfour Google Drive but apparently not 
len ratingfour I may have to delete the app 
len ratingfive Estudio trabajo todo

len ratingfive Es molesto tener que abrir la app de Microsoft para poder ver lo que en esta no puedo 
len ratingone Why can t I open files in Apple s native File folder without Google Drive redirecting me save and open my file in Google Drive 
len ratingone It s annoying and frustrating 
len ratingfive fast safe
len ratingfive Can t say enough about how much I love Google drive 
len ratingone Absolutely terrible that you removed the passcode feature from this app 
len ratingone What the heck is the point of removing it even if you think iOS security is enough 
len ratingone Does it hurt to have an added layer 
len ratingone So senseless 
len ratingone I have to remove the app from my phone now
len ratingfive Since I still can t jump to an IPhone since I love the Samsung phones this helps me a lot to stay connected between my IPad and IMac and my Samsung S

len ratingfive What s not to love 
len ratingone Maybe you should try making it possible to close out a video before you submit your app to the App Store 
len ratingfive I normal despise reviews 
len ratingfive In fact I have never actually left a review purely on principle 
len ratingfive Today however I saw that Google Drive added a feature to preview PSD files in mobile 
len ratingfive Let s just say I m thrilled 
len ratingfive I can t show you the happy dance I performed upon hearing this news because this review system has limitations but it was a good one 
len ratingfive Go forth and enjoy 
len ratingfour Pretty easy to use 
len ratingfour The only feature i d love to see is a goto page or find when viewing a pdf 
len ratingfive I just did this so it would stop asking me
len ratingfive  One of my favorites a very good cloud drive 
len ratingfive  Excellent
len ratingfive So easy to use it s the perfect app
len ratingfive Totally Awesome app

len ratingfive I talk too much your technology allows Pictures to express the thoughts Thanks Gerald Bentley Pump Fitters Inc

len ratingfour I really enjoy Google Drive and it s great 
len ratingfour But I wish it was a little better on IPad 
len ratingfour It needs more updates on IPad 
len ratingfour It s much better on computer 
len ratingfour But otherwise it s great 
len ratingfour I can go on my drive anytime and read the things that been shared with me and keep my all stuff in drive 
len ratingfour Great help 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive I love it

len ratingfive Sharing comments and struggling on the project 
len ratingfive Generally it is good tool to collaborate the job seriously 
len ratingfive Google drive super drive period 
len ratingfive This is easy to use and allows seamless file storage access across all my devices what sets it further apart is the amount of free storage I get 
len ratingfive It is easy to precede the information from it 
len ratingfive Great job
len ratingone Until the passcode feature is re added or a new solution to secure my drive on my phone is implemented this app is useless to me 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Access to all your docs spreadsheets pics notes etc 
len ratingfive even while on the road or using other devices 
len ratingthree Easy to use and easy to adapt to changes in your file organization is good but very cumbersome moving things from several mobile apps into specific folders 
len ratingthree This need tweaking by software engineering 
len ratingfive best for traveling
len ratingfive Best app for an office on the go 
len ratingone  Would not recommend this app to anyone 
len ratingone Got stuck half way through installation and made me reset my entire phone to delete it
len ratingfive Safe virtual hard disk for your memories working files mobile office cabinet and sharing point to others by a few cli cks

len ratingthree The latest update says it can view PSD files and I m a bit disappointed that doesn t seem to be working 
len ratingthree You can see the thumbnail but that s it 
len ratingfive If you have an entire IT team and high security requirements the Office apps are probably a better choice 
len ratingfive But if it s just Me Myself and Irene running the show this app will keep you from pulling out your hair 
len ratingfive And you ll actually be able to find your documents when you need to

len ratingthree Support for svg psd files 
len ratingthree Not this release

len ratingfive Google simply I you 
len ratingone New update supposed to be able to preview PSD files 
len ratingone Doesn t work
len ratingone Absolute morons who designed this app removed password protection 
len ratingone If someone has access to your phone they can just click into your google drive

len ratingone Absolutely moronic decision 
len ratingone Don t use this risky app
len ratingfive Good job

len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Best app
len ratingfive I use this to collaborate with friends in non profits share family photos and get quick access to my files 
len ratingfive I use the live editing tools 
len ratingfive It s easy to share the doc sometimes a challenge to explain to the person who needs to constantly access a share but worth it

len ratingfour It is so useful for someone like me who travel out of country 
len ratingone im moving to OneDrive
len ratingfive Great cloud storage option by Google 
len ratingfive A bit of a work in progress but improvements are always happening

len ratingfive Even those not born in the high tech age can do it 
len ratingfive Freaked awesome 
len ratingfive Nothing but positive results
len ratingfive It works great I used to save my sermons and I have them available instantly in my iPad Phone etc 
len ratingfive Works great for me 
len ratingfive Thank Google

len ratingfive Who would have thought 
len ratingfive Loved the simple training 
len ratingfive Google drive is a great place to store you files for school 
len ratingfive Just beginning to see the crazy benefits of Google Drive 
len ratingfive I am a control freak teacher and the knowledge that I have everything with me at the tip of my finger makes me giddy 
len ratingfour I use it every day and it is generally excellent with a few strange behaviors 
len ratingfive I have to admit I m a slave to my iPhone 
len ratingfive Yet I refuse to upgrade because so many people have been hanging issues with the newest models 
len ratingfive My phone is on it s last legs and I had about photos videos on my phone that I needs backing up 
len ratingfive I downloaded the Drive app because I wanted easy access to my files always and it was so quick 
len ratingfive And some of my files are HUGH 
len ratingfive Thanks for making it easy 
len ratingthree You can t access links on here When I have technology I can t do anything on this app when I got it I thought I could do that and that is why this app is bad 
len ratingone I tried everything to select about images and download them to my iPhone 
len ratingone So far I found that you only can download image by image which is a lengthy process 
len ratingone Google are you serious
len ratingfive This is great 
len ratingfive All I need to store and send files 
len ratingfive Couldn t function without it 
len ratingfour I love this but it could have some improvements
len ratingfive  Easy 
len ratingfour This app is great but I miss the ability to lock your files 
len ratingfour This extra security was very effective and comforting 
len ratingthree  Only selected certain photos rather than all 
len ratingthree Why 
len ratingfour Have used Drive for about years 
len ratingfour I keep files and pictures I want to access from all of my devices 
len ratingfour Have been renovating a house and I keep pictures plans cost spreadsheets and materials lists here at my finger tips where ever I am regardless of which device I have access to 
len ratingthree For some unknown reason at least unknown to the Apple techies I cannot update this App on my MacPro 
len ratingthree I have tried downloading the latest App repeatedly without success 
len ratingthree Still keep getting a notification saying I am using an outdated version and should download the latest version 
len ratingthree Huh 
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingfive Common Denominator of my life 
len ratingfive Excelente tool for sharing documents y great functionality
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive  This app is invaluable 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive It s versatile and user friendly 
len ratingfive Google Drive has become a partner for all of my freelance and professional work allowing dynamic collaboration and fast file sharing 
len ratingone I don t know how the things that are saved on my drive are there but I ve never consciously connected anything to my drive and I don t even like google 
len ratingone I got a drive because it came with being forced to get failed google in order to access YouTube 
len ratingone Screw google you should be dissolved before you become a multi industry monopoly 
len ratingone Navigating or even finding folders that you have access is incredibly frustrating
len ratingtwo I have an iPhone iPad and iMac

len ratingfive I do keep a backup of everything on a memory drive just in case safety first but I ve never had any issues 
len ratingfive I have years of documents on my account and am still not even close to having to purchase more space

len ratingfive Like the ease of use and the fact that I can look at my information across multiple platforms with this application 
len ratingfive Thanks for the app 
len ratingfive Easy to use and it works between devices 
len ratingone I m trying to open a file and it just spins and spins and doesn t open 
len ratingfive I am gonna kill myself
len ratingtwo It is nearly useless at letting me find out where I am and then showing where I generally want to go without insisting on a route to a specific place 
len ratingtwo Might be fine using a computer as opposed to an iPad in a moving car and a specific travel plan 
len ratingtwo  DSC
len ratingfive I don t review apps either but I feel that I ought to chime in with the million others who have reviewed Google Drive and say I couldn t operate without it 
len ratingfive Being able to access files remotely today is a must and I ve found the platform to be very stable whether I m using Mac OS or Windows 
len ratingfive I just hope that Google is taking the cloud security of all those gigs stored on their servers seriously especially from human error 
len ratingfive With drive I have an extraordinary easy access to all my documents on my finger tips with just a click of a button 
len ratingfive Amazing and uniquely google 
len ratingfive Todo somo uno
len ratingfour Thanks for this feature I used it conveniently thru my iPhone without using a scanner to forward important documents to my recipient 
len ratingfive Love the instant access anywhere and the coordination with other apps I use 
len ratingfive Google Drive is perfect for me and does everything I need

len ratingfive  Google drive just made my life much easier 
len ratingfive It s a tool everyone should use it simplifies your tech life

len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive Very easy UI 
len ratingfive Does exactly what I need it to do 
len ratingfive Perfect app
len ratingtwo Years later and I still do not comprehend this program app 
len ratingtwo So confusing 
len ratingfive  I like the storage capacity and that I can have all my files and documents with me wherever I go 
len ratingfive I can organize my work and personal books recipes etc 
len ratingfive whatever you name 
len ratingfive It s easy access 
len ratingfive One of the best inventions 
len ratingone What happened to face id 
len ratingone Very uncool they took away this security factor
len ratingthree I d give drive more stars if it remembered the documents that were last read better 
len ratingthree Once in a while after exiting drive with a document open it ll still be open the next time I go back to drive so that I can easily continue from where I left off 
len ratingthree However more often feels like maybe just over half the time it simply forgets what was open and I have to go open it again plus the docs open on the first page when this happens too 
len ratingfive I paid with pleasure my family photos all my bachelor classes with some ebooks ideas It s friendly user 
len ratingfive  Will be nice add something funny 
len ratingone I have used Dropbox since its conception 
len ratingone I now have to use gmail and must use the proprietary google drive to attach documents in email 
len ratingone I am beyond irritated 
len ratingone No I don t want to link the two drives 
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfive Intuitive 
len ratingfive Easy to send to large groups such as schools churches families 
len ratingfive Compatible with Apple Numbers MS Excel Word Pages calendars 
len ratingfive Making life easier 
len ratingfive Keep on tootin 
len ratingfive I use Google docs and sheets an incredible amount for work as well as personal use and it s such an easy and accessible tool 
len ratingfive I don t know what I d do without if 
len ratingfour The only annoying thing is when you open a website with a linked file and the file automatically saves in the drive without asking 
len ratingfour The file is impossible to delete from within the app and you have no choice but to use a computer to do it manually 
len ratingfour Super annoying 
len ratingfive That s the summary really 
len ratingfive I just really appreciate how easy it is to navigate between my google accounts 
len ratingfive I have google accounts through my school district I am a teacher my graduate school and I have my own gmail account 
len ratingfive I have documents I need to access daily and edit on each account 
len ratingfive Thank you for allowing me to switch between them so easily 
len ratingfive Sheets Docs and Slides are great apps 
len ratingfive I just wish a Forms app would be created 
len ratingfive Convenience of the Cloud need I say more 
len ratingfive I like using Sheets Docs and I appreciate the availability of the many the templates 
len ratingone Can t edit through app
len ratingfive Best cloud storage
len ratingfive I am some what computer slow 
len ratingfive This app has been very easy to use and I can do what I need to and am looking to do with this app 
len ratingthree Needs a note taking feature on the pdfs
len ratingfive Google Drive is very neat it has ample space for files with good sorting distinction 
len ratingthree Drive doesn t play any 
len ratingthree Wav file music on IOS 
len ratingfive Hey what s up I love your app it s totally AMAZING Yeah
len ratingfive I love it

len ratingfive Buena
len ratingfour Great application Especially for legal documents etc that can t wait for office or home 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive If you use Google Drive this is a must have app on your mobile devices 
len ratingfive Google drive has made my life as a graphic designer SOOOO much easier 
len ratingfive I love the flow between google apps docs sheets etc 
len ratingfive but Google Drive takes the cake 
len ratingfive As the title very clearly stated this is a fairly well designed application 
len ratingfive However writing and editing documents is difficult partially because of the small screen but also because of the layout of the document 
len ratingfive You can t see the margins of the document and you also can t edit them 
len ratingfive Changing fonts and other meticulous tasks are also quite difficult based on the size of the options 
len ratingfive Lastly when attaching documents to Gmail from Drive you cannot select more than one document at a time which means you have to from Gmail to Drive several times if you want to send more than one document in the same email 
len ratingfive Overall however I see this as a well designed application especially for document viewing editing and with very few flaws I definitely recommend this application 
len ratingfive The best
len ratingfive I have all my work here easy
len ratingfive It is accessible on any devices which is extremely useful 
len ratingfive This a very good site to use I highly recommend it and I would recommend this to anyone that is free and doesn t have a laptop or monitor 
len ratingtwo This is an interface from the previous century 
len ratingtwo Hard to navigate non intuitive and just plain clumsy 
len ratingtwo Do yourself a favor and get Dropbox 
len ratingfive Why did you replace the passcode from ios it s been good 
len ratingfive App works well 
len ratingone Trying to delete unwanted pics off drive it says it can t do at the same coincidental moment I get notice that ipad is full 
len ratingone How does it not work 
len ratingfive Trust me
len ratingfive Everything I need 
len ratingfive Very convenient at times in need of an document
len ratingfive Incredibly well made and easy to use 
len ratingfive Very easy app to navigate
len ratingfive A hard Drive for my Brain 
len ratingfive Thank you so much Google 
len ratingfive Helps me keep it together 
len ratingfive Very useful for grad school
len ratingfive Thank you very useful
len ratingfive It s ma safe deposit locker for all ma stuff thank you Google 
len ratingfive Works great for streaming video files from my computer on my phone 
len ratingone  Says loading nonstop 
len ratingone Isn t working on my PC 
len ratingone Way to screw up Google Drive 
len ratingone Typical of Google 
len ratingfive Finally loaded the app on my phone 
len ratingfive Now I can share docs to clients on the fly 
len ratingfive Sped up my business unbelievably 
len ratingfive A Real Estate agent that uses technology is a must 
len ratingfive I freaking love Google Drive

len ratingfive Also to be able to easily share files with others is just through a click 
len ratingfour This does the main job and needs to do which is to make files available from any computer 
len ratingfour The hard part is easily organizing things 
len ratingfour For instance when you save a file to your Drive you can click on the button to organize however there s no easy way to search through the many folders that might be the one you were looking for to put the file 
len ratingfive To use 
len ratingfive Great if you need to move files to multiple people or just need online storage 
len ratingone I have multiple files that keep crashing we soon as I get to page of

len ratingone I thought I d check out what I have stored and noticed you Google had updated three weeks ago and a week ago for the iJunk X FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION So I wanted to thin out stuff I don t need and decided to get rid of dead weight 
len ratingone I found it interesting that I ve tried to delete pics and they won t delete clicked pic selected delete waiting box comes up delete permanently uh that s why I selected Delete clicked that box waiting won t delete hummmm exited app 
len ratingone Cleared iPad memory tried Again Times click Click CLICK CLICK CLICK hummmmmm so can t delete so try something else exit app click on app go to pic click on pic another pic comes up but the pic I want to delete is still there

len ratingfour Google drive is great

len ratingfour It s easy to use and mostly super fast 
len ratingfour My only complaint is the video processing it does when uploading videos 
len ratingfour I know they are trying to ensure playback on any device but I already know the codec I used is sufficient so this adds unnecessary time 
len ratingfour An option to not re encode my videos would be awesome 
len ratingfour That would make it stars 
len ratingfive Great way to access your docs everywhere Thanks Google 
len ratingone Google drive no longer has passcode lock option 
len ratingone Now anyone that has access to your unlocked phones can look at delete copy any file in your google drive 
len ratingone Will be deleting this app
len ratingfour Google Drive is my preferred way to share large numbers of high res photos or large video files too large to email 
len ratingfour With the ability to limit access to particular folders within Drive I can determine who has access to which files 
len ratingfour I would like to be able to cast directly to Chromecast from my iPad but the app still lacks this feature 
len ratingfour If it weren t for this issue I d give it a star rating 
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingone Buggy
len ratingfive  Team Google got this soooo right 
len ratingfive It actually works like you know things can but too often don t 
len ratingfive They give you a decent amount of storage for free and it unfucks sharing iPhone video so you can circulate your own content as you wish to

len ratingfive This is great 
len ratingfive So much easier then iCloud 
len ratingfive I can name and rename share an link it and stop if I want 
len ratingfour Works well

len ratingtwo My emails go to Gmail which before I changed to Google nonsense I was able to receive emails on homepage email Gmail

len ratingfive It s an easy way for us to hear what we played and decide if we want to make a change somewhere in a song 
len ratingfive Each member in our band listens to recordings between jams to see what hilarious stuff may have been caught 
len ratingfive Also a simple way to share our music with friends

len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive The app is very useful for business men
len ratingthree Would easily give it stars 
len ratingthree However you cannot password protect a shared link to a folder 
len ratingthree In this environment it should be table stakes to password protect shared links 
len ratingthree Why not Google 
len ratingfour I love all the services that since can do and how fluid ur is between devices but I don t like how unreliable it can get off I don t have signal when I m not connected to WiFi

len ratingfive It s really easy to get files anywhere and I have experienced this app is more compatible with all the apps
len ratingone I was uploading a document from my email and was required to install google drive 
len ratingone The problem is I can t make any changes to document 
len ratingone What was the point 
len ratingone I duplicated a doc and now it is continuously making more of itself and I don t know how to stop it 
len ratingone The upload speeds are also slow and I have school work to turn in

len ratingfive I am so much grateful for this technology 
len ratingfive As a teacher this is a effective and efficient tool for teaching and learning 
len ratingfive Looking forward to many more tech that would positively impact education 
len ratingone Log in lags and or crashes Log out Lags Making folder and that stuff crashes AND lags 
len ratingone I selected Make a Copy for a zip file on the Shared With Me tab and the file is now continuously duplicating within my Drive 
len ratingone I am using the latest released versions of iOS and the Google Drive app on an iPhone X I was able to stop the process by logging in via my PC and deleting the file that was the original source 
len ratingone Upon opening the Google Drive iOS app again the nonstop file duplication process has resumed 
len ratingone It has taken me four days to upload my recent videos and pics to this drive each pic taking several minutes each painfully slow 
len ratingone Normally I don t rate apps but the app asked me to rate it when I was especially frustrated so I tried by selecting only one star 
len ratingone Then the app would not let me submit my rating with only one star selected 
len ratingone That was so slimy and unfair 
len ratingone So I made the arduous journey all the way to the App Store to rate the product 
len ratingone Very sneaky to invite people to rate in app and then only allow the good ratings to get through 
len ratingone I just lost respect for this company 
len ratingfour I m not having any luck with getting stuff moved 
len ratingfour Don t think I have anything saved
len ratingone I did multiple pages of work and the next day it all disappeared 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive I enjoy this app google is literally the greatest thing invented wish I could give stars baby 
len ratingone Can t move or copy docs from my drive to team drive team drive difficult to find access

len ratingfour They do a good job of keeping it affordable and large data 
len ratingfive Amazing app for productivity and working on the go 
len ratingtwo I don t get why they don t let you edit offline 
len ratingtwo Like just have it sync automatically when I get back in service 
len ratingtwo Like a message outbox right 
len ratingtwo But no 
len ratingtwo I just can t ever edit any doc or drive file ever while on the go 
len ratingtwo God forbid I would want to draft a word document in drive gasp from my phone 
len ratingtwo Maybe in they will finally figure out how to make an app for that 
len ratingtwo I ve been waiting 
len ratingtwo Very detrimental that they want us to use google docs to open some files but then google drive to do other stuff 
len ratingtwo I thought docs was done but no they want to bring it back 
len ratingfive I really like the chrome cast option for my movies 
len ratingfive I have the month plan for tb of space and I keep my whole digital library 
len ratingone I love google drive I use it daily 
len ratingone Since the last update I copied pictures within drive and it continues to create HUNDREDS of copies of the same pictures 
len ratingone Every time I open the app on any device there are dozens of new copies 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive I don t really want to right a long review 
len ratingfive But I find drive to be indispensable for so much of what I do 
len ratingfive I am able to save to drive from my phone and pull it up on my computer later 
len ratingfive Amazing app I love using it
len ratingfive Great app as it supports linking to several accounts including my university email account 
len ratingfive I love being able to access my google docs from anywhere on the go 
len ratingone I have my organic chemistry textbook on my googledrive 
len ratingone It doesn t allow me to open it and I have to download the whole thing on my computer each time I want to read it
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingfive All of it 
len ratingone They have done most stupid thing that s ever been done 
len ratingone Took away password lock option 
len ratingone That alone caused me to delete app 
len ratingone Men have kids that play with their phone it MIGHT be pictures they don t want their kids to see 
len ratingone HOW STUPID GOOGLE CAN BE AT TIMES 
len ratingone Im reading on every update like many others I ll redownload it when password gets put back on
len ratingfive I m in rd grade and use this a bunch in school so one day I ask my dad to get it for me and he did

len ratingfive I even know how to send things to ppl 
len ratingfive I like this app cause it is organized and neat 
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingfour I love it Apple screwed up pictures once so I rely on Google drive now
len ratingfour I really like Google Docs but you can t edit when your using a iOS but you can use it on a IPad when you have a wireless keyboard 
len ratingfour If they made a screen typing update I would like to know
len ratingfive I definitely enjoy using Google Drive for the last years 
len ratingfive It was always helpful for access from anywhere in the world 
len ratingfive A great tool to share documents photos videos etc 
len ratingfive with co workers family members students etc 
len ratingthree I have a lot of pdf files and it takes forever to load on both LTE and Wi Fi 
len ratingthree There are times my PDFs don t load at all even if I have set them to open offline 
len ratingthree It is user friendly and I can share or move files easily 
len ratingthree I just wish I could actually access the files 
len ratingfive Useful for classes
len ratingfour Everything is ok but bring back the passcode also make a select all and download button so we don t have to go through all of them individually to re download them 
len ratingfive  New Review with my new iPhone X GB Sprint DagNabbitRabbit Even faster and easier to use 
len ratingfive Switching between accounts couldn t be easier and using all of the google family of document applications including PDF and spreadsheets couldn t be faster 
len ratingfive Loading instantly JPG images are a breeze to save load view edit delete on the fly 
len ratingfive Can t say enough about this wonderful app from Google Most Definitely DagNabbitRabbit Approved Wonderful one of the most incredibly versatile programs that one could ever ask for 
len ratingfive With Google Drive YOU have that ability to not only save and protect your images and share them if you wish BUT you may also save Google Sheets 
len ratingfive Notes and much much more 
len ratingfive This program saves your metadata from your images perfectly 
len ratingfive For those who may not be familiar with metadata date created date modified size of file location of image and in some apps such as ProCamera can actually show you from which compass point you were pointing the camera when said image was taken 
len ratingfive And this actually works 
len ratingfive All to often whence an image is copied to a program an app or another device or drive this valuable metadata is lost and you simply see date created today 
len ratingfive Even if the image was taken years ago 
len ratingfive A truly remarkable application 
len ratingfive Definitely DagNabbitRabbit Approved
len ratingfive This thing is awesome 
len ratingfive I use it almost all the time 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive Superb 
len ratingfive verynice
len ratingfive Simply the best of the best thanks n keep up please 
len ratingtwo  It keeps deleting and corrupting my files 
len ratingfive Need to add change notifications like Box does so that added files will triggers notifications to users with that option turned on 
len ratingfive It is the best way to keep every thing in reach
len ratingfive We are a top producing luxury team we have been using google drive to manage our business and it s been amazing 
len ratingfive This is a key tool for us we strongly recommend 
len ratingfive  pastranagroup
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google drive for some time now and I absolutely love it 
len ratingfive I can see my documents anywhere I go and even in my phone 
len ratingfive Definitely recommended to everyone 
len ratingfive Google Drive is the BEST in my opinion cloud storage app 
len ratingfive Everything syncs instantly and I can back up files from and SD card 
len ratingfive The collaboration on Google Drive is great 
len ratingfive Anyone can share a file with me and I can share a file to them 
len ratingfive Keep it up Google Thanks 
len ratingone You re losing customers because you took away the passcode feature 
len ratingone I can only assume you re selling my data now 
len ratingone Goodbye google drive 
len ratingfive Finding Logging in to my account thank you Google
len ratingfive Just love it and must to have it 
len ratingfive Can store photos and other 
len ratingfive It s great for school
len ratingfive Love how all my pictures can be safe here
len ratingone Why the crap can t I just edit in drive 
len ratingone Why do I need to get so many apps just to edit my papers on my phone 
len ratingfive Generally works as expected 
len ratingfive It s stable 
len ratingfive It s supports more features as time passes 
len ratingfive Overall excellent 
len ratingfive As my mentor Tony once said Google is so easy to use a real engineering masterpiece in an online universe overstuffed with apps and software that have shiny covers and empty insides TTHHHEEERRRREEGGGRRREEEAAATTTT 
len ratingfive Don t know what I d do without google drive and the suite of apps 
len ratingfive Helps me keep on top of projects and keep my team in the loop 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I can access documents anywhere in the world on my phone tablet computer love it 
len ratingfive I love this app so much There are great things on this app 
len ratingone The Google Drive app works very well on my iPhone 
len ratingone When I try to use the iPad app however the documents are all messed up 
len ratingone I can find a spreadsheet and open it up but the dates listed in the lower tabs do not match the date on the document 
len ratingone For example if I open up the document for schedule for February when I click on the tab for particular day at the bottom it shows up as a completely different month 
len ratingone This does not happen with the iPhone app 
len ratingfive Simply put I don t know what I would do without Google Drive Sheets and all the other programs I use everyday 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Google Drive has helped me in many different ways 
len ratingfive It s a great tool for work I have multiple files that I need to share with my coworkers including pdfs jpgs etc and the drive lets me do so with ease 
len ratingfive I also use it for school 
len ratingfive If you re a high school or college student and want to make sure you always can pull up an essay to print out or create a document to share with a group for projects the Drive has you set 
len ratingfive I also use it to keep personal photos and documents on there as well 
len ratingfive It connects with all the other apps of Google and is a great tool 
len ratingfive So useful and nice to use
len ratingfive I love having the ability to share files with other teachers 
len ratingfive Makes connecting to all files and docs super easy 
len ratingfive I would recommend this app to everyone 
len ratingfive I love that I can work on my lessons and other documents from the comfort of my home and not have to drive to my school and use my classroom computer 
len ratingfive This has made snow days and eLearning days a snap 
len ratingfive What is not to love 
len ratingfive But come on organization multi format file support always available wherever you go 
len ratingfive Convenient 
len ratingfive If you re in school this app drive is a must 
len ratingfive Finally a solution for the clutter when using G Drive for multiple projects and teams 
len ratingone  Why would they possibly remove password protection from this supposedly secure application 
len ratingone Now anytime someone uses my iPad they have full access to all of my private Google Docs too 
len ratingone This would be like having a banking application that didn t require a password 
len ratingone The passcode and fingerprint reader security feature did exist but they quietly took it away so beware Google Docs is no longer a secure location to store any sensitive documents at least on mobile or tablet 
len ratingfour Just started to learn how this document works 
len ratingtwo Having a terrible time making files available offline 
len ratingtwo For whatever reason it starts to download then stays at about 
len ratingtwo Even if left alone overnight it doesn t get past that 
len ratingtwo Also files take up space when attempted to be made available offline regardless of completion 
len ratingtwo Furthermore when files are either stopped from being made available offline or deleted from the offline folder space is still taken up 
len ratingtwo I rely heavily with google drive for sharing files with people but I absolutely wish we had an alternative 
len ratingfour One of my G drive folders is a group whose members very often complain that the G drive is hard to use
len ratingfive I have used Google Docs on both PC Mac and IPhone for years 
len ratingfive Convenient access to a free word processor resume templates project and poster templates 
len ratingfive Easily accessible from anywhere in the world and can be printed when necessary 
len ratingfive Utilized my entire undergraduate career and at work 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Like it a lot
len ratingfive This is mandatory for all adults 
len ratingfive Thank you Drive
len ratingfive It is so easy to use 
len ratingfive I really think you should get it 
len ratingthree  At least good enough 
len ratingfive It s a wonderful handy doc carry tool specially you are traveling

len ratingfive I use google drive all the time 
len ratingfive It makes planning trips so easy 
len ratingone  Will not open PDFs 
len ratingone Updated app

len ratingfive This is a game changer if you are still Carrying a flash drive wake up it s 
len ratingfive I am happy

len ratingfive Drive is essential for my daily needs 
len ratingfive I can take my school work with me wherever I am 
len ratingfive I have been able to create and share files with my various groups that I never thought I would be able to 
len ratingfive Controlling who can edit shared documents makes gaming groups and office group equally easy to manage 
len ratingfive I use it mostly on mobile my one frustration is not being able to transfer PDFs from iBooks easily and that is Apple s problem 
len ratingfive A function that would allow you to search your mobile device for files that you can upload would be ideal 
len ratingfive Love this first idea 
len ratingfive Very good but we need to return the passcode again why you remove it
len ratingfive Google Drive is now my Go To File Sharing and Cloud Drive 
len ratingfive Definitely Recommend 
len ratingfive A perfect app for moving storing files 
len ratingfive A cloud run by Google what more could you ask 
len ratingthree Por lobisto funciona bien

len ratingfive I can t speak well enough about it it s that great 
len ratingfive Give it a try 
len ratingfive I love the Drive 
len ratingfive I save everything there 
len ratingfive For years now 
len ratingfive Love using Docs all my work at my fingertips everywhere I am connected My second graders loved using Docs as well because the application is fairly intuitive and they could access their folders and files in any computer lab 
len ratingfive They also enjoyed the share button 
len ratingfive I like that you can see folders that others have shared with you 
len ratingfive Simple but flexible 
len ratingtwo I uploaded a new photo yesterday and the app says it s synced but the photo doesn t appear 
len ratingtwo Not the first time this has happened 
len ratingtwo Wish the app were more reliable 
len ratingone F u Google

len ratingfive I love going to google drive and finding everything in one place Gmail blogs photos there is more that I haven t even explored 
len ratingfour  It is easy and logical the way the software is set up to upload the documents as needed 
len ratingfive Clean beautiful does exactly what you need it to do 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingthree Please add an option to save a copy to an iPad or computer 
len ratingfive  Definitely my favourite place to write 
len ratingfive I like that I can access it from any point at any time when I need my work 
len ratingfive It helps to be able to link people what I ve written have collaborators etc 
len ratingfive You can t do that with Microsoft Word 
len ratingfive I use this for personal work college and more 
len ratingfive I don t even need a USB any more 
len ratingfive I love all the features this program offers 
len ratingfive I m glad Google Drive exists 
len ratingfive No complaints in three years 
len ratingfive Google drive really helped me get organized with my professional and personal life 
len ratingfive I highly recommend it 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Lo uso hace varios a os porque es ordenado y mi informaci n est segura de p rdidas

len ratingone Any program that asks for feedback gets a one star review from me 
len ratingone If everyone did the same developers would get the message 
len ratingfour Always room for improvement
len ratingthree A smooth ride 
len ratingthree Thanks Toni Banner Paul Toni s helper 
len ratingthree Great job 
len ratingfive Transferring large files can be hard on a mobile device but with google drive everything seems to be very easy
len ratingthree Don t like the UI much 
len ratingthree Sync not the best 
len ratingfive  dfhk
len ratingone  I recently used google docs and google drive for a VERY important project at my school that was about of my overall grade 
len ratingone I finished my project and was about to print it when half of it got deleted 
len ratingone I was mad because everything is supposed to save in the drive but it didn t 
len ratingone I spent a LONG time rewriting whole whole thing with my partner 
len ratingfive Easy access from any device thanks google
len ratingfive It doesn t get any easier than this 
len ratingfive Plenty of space 
len ratingfive Easy access on my computer and my smart phone 
len ratingfive Dragon drop easy and it s never down 
len ratingfive Highly recommend
len ratingfive I might have thought that I would ve have gotten the tool I needed to backup my files but I made my info increase and decided to try a helpful tool to keep great storage 
len ratingfive I was not in the mind of this tool I would ve thought I would not be able to access my info when I have to but this tool has taken me to a wonderful point in my life that I am inspired to use a data storage and other useful operations to make my life a lot easier 
len ratingfive I can see that this tool then brings me to a level as a genius when there are resources to store and review in this tool 
len ratingfive This was a vast majority in my life right now and I hope to continue the use of this tool 
len ratingfive  So my computer doesn t work so then I used my phone to do my work thanks 
len ratingfive Always there when I need what I m looking for 
len ratingone This app as seemingly with all Google apps ignores the App Store setting disabling in app reviews and ratings 
len ratingone I turned that off for a reason 
len ratingthree I saved a video to google drive and made a copy before deleting it permanently so i can do more things with it original was shared 
len ratingthree The video copy started to make copies of itself everytime i deleted or opened google drive 
len ratingthree The copies don t mass replicate anymore just once or twice now 
len ratingthree It took up so much space because of it 
len ratingfive I still can t believe this is a free service 
len ratingfive I know they are using some of the data but is still pretty awesome to be able to access these took 
len ratingfive I am a fan of Google 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingthree Normally it works fairly well but with the newest update it s been crashing a bunch 
len ratingthree I need Google Drive for school and can t really function without it 
len ratingthree Please fix it 
len ratingthree I ve never had a problem before and I ve been using it for years now 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive No glitches 
len ratingfive Streamlined tasks 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingfive Wish these online drives would join together 
len ratingfive  No downloading
len ratingone I don t appreciate that the website purposefully restricts functionality to the point where you are forced to download the app to do the most basic tasks like adding a folder 
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfive So glad to be able to have it on my phone to save documents and upload them to my email 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Especially Because u don t have to use wi fi or the Internet And it can be easily accessed anytime
len ratingfive I love your program 
len ratingone Google drive still has a major bug persisting which is save to camera roll reduces the quality of the image 
len ratingone A workaround that does NOT always work is as follows tap on three dots send copy save image Issue persists that even the workaround will still randomly result in a reduced image 
len ratingone Only when you see preparing to export will the original size and quality image be saved to your phone 
len ratingone Unfortunately there is no rhyme or reason as to when preparing to export will pop up or not 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingthree It tried to get me to write a five star review
len ratingfour Help would be wonderful 
len ratingfive  I m an educator who uses G Suite 
len ratingfive I ve used Drive for personal use previously but using it for work makes life so much less complicated 
len ratingfive Going between my desktop Chromebook and phone is seamless 
len ratingfive Switching between my personal account and work account is a breeze as well 
len ratingfive It s great but it s hard to understand how to work with this app also it has notes just in english and no other language
len ratingfive Very convenient and user friendly 
len ratingfive Lets me move files from my computer to Google Drive and i can open file on app on my phone or tablet 
len ratingfive Loving it 
len ratingfive This is a great place to store all the information you want and choose to share the files you want with others 
len ratingfive The app is a little more complex than the actual website because you can just drag files with on the actual website 
len ratingfive But it still works amazing 
len ratingfive I m not too tech savvy and this is really easy to use 
len ratingfive Can t live without it 
len ratingfive All my docs everywhere I go 
len ratingfour I find this app very helpful 
len ratingfive It s good 
len ratingone If you re going to harass me for a review of course I m going to give you a shotty review 
len ratingone If I wanted to issue a review I would choose to review not have it shoved in my face every three seconds 
len ratingfive Great tool for keeping documents accessible across multiple platforms
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingthree On my iPad it work like the best but same app on my android it was only as good 
len ratingthree you couldn t like save stuff down and even installed some of the same music applications didn t even react the same in that same way like I got jipped for using the fastest android yet applications on my iPad was like the only optionTo push stuff to my music apps since apple iPad does not let you see files in side the os application any thing but containers stuff I am not an apple user so forced to us os for HMI and future SCADA needs of the future thank s to advertisement and social media winning it and real work utilities and machine control are leading to needs to have anti dependence for always having access to www yet still communicate and be functional operation able window failssssss us 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Makes it so much easier to view a document from my phone when I don t have access to my laptop 
len ratingfive Use it right after purchases to upload receipts from my car 
len ratingfour Slow but I still love it 
len ratingfour I have had a file shared with me by my teacher and I clicked ADD TO DRIVE 
len ratingfour It has been DUPLICATING ITSELF ENDLESSLY EVER SINCE 
len ratingfour This started either Friday last week or Monday this week 
len ratingfour Please fix it 
len ratingfour IT REALLY SICKS AND NOBODY SHOULD EVER BUY IT
len ratingfive It s great
len ratingfive Heymgogg
len ratingfive me encanta 
len ratingfive Been using for along time 
len ratingfive Never let me down 
len ratingfour Could use a little more storage but it works great easily accessible and understand 
len ratingfive Very usefully easy and emergency excellent
len ratingone  They have done most stupid thing that s ever been done 
len ratingone Took away password lock option 
len ratingone That alone caused me to delete app 
len ratingone Men have kids that play with their phone it MIGHT be pictures they don t want their kids to see 
len ratingone HOW STUPID GOOGLE CAN BE AT TIMES 
len ratingfive This is so dope
len ratingfive I can put videos on here without wasting my storage
len ratingone Can t access team drives with this app 
len ratingone Can t find stuff even immediately after upload 
len ratingone Google get a library science major to help your programmers 
len ratingtwo The app was nearly perfect for the average uses save for adding a select all button rather than having to click one by one 
len ratingtwo Why remove the added security of having a separate PIN or requiring Touch ID to unlock the drive 
len ratingtwo Given that my phone is used by children to play games I prefer the peace of mind knowing they can t access personal documents or files if they didn t know my google drive PIN or have my fingerprint for google drive Touch ID verification 
len ratingtwo I have zero use for having this app installed now 
len ratingfive Its a good and secure space where to keep the information easily accessible from my phone and computer whenever I need it 
len ratingfive Lots of storage
len ratingthree Why did you remove the passcode 
len ratingthree Please bring it back 
len ratingfive Very nice app 
len ratingfive I use drive for everything but the most important use for me is an unexpected one Listening to my audio files 
len ratingfive The iPhone proprietary music app makes it impossible to listen to anything you don t download from them 
len ratingfive Requires iTunes syncing with a computer all the s stuff that no one does anymore 
len ratingfive I have my files in the google cloud and listen to them easily with google drive 
len ratingfive Google please keep this simplistic approach 
len ratingfive Simple is perfect 
len ratingfour Good for school
len ratingone Please fix this upgrade 
len ratingone It s causing abnormal behavior on iPhone and iPad Pro 
len ratingone Creating many copies x of file when asked to create copy 
len ratingone Unacceptable and needs fixing 
len ratingtwo PROBLEM Duplicates of my recent documents continue to populate in my Drive folder 
len ratingtwo It won t stop 
len ratingtwo I ve had to delete over of the same file in the past day 
len ratingtwo It s super annoying and I hope that google fixes this problem soon
len ratingfive  By far the most functional of all cloud storage apps 
len ratingfive I use it to keep my writing Docs secure 
len ratingfive Thanks for making things easy much appreciated 
len ratingfour OneDrive recently added a feature to allow for two accounts to be seen at one in the Apple Files app 
len ratingfour I have my school and personal OneDrive shown 
len ratingfour Next year I am going to college 
len ratingfour I already have my account 
len ratingfour However I cannot have my school account and my personal account in Apple Files app at the same time 
len ratingfour I use my personal Google account a lot 
len ratingfour I must switch between them in the Google Drive app 
len ratingfour It s pretty easy but annoying 
len ratingfour It s not an issue yet but in a few months it will be 
len ratingfour Can you please make it similar to OneDrive in the Files app Thank you
len ratingfour Very good program 
len ratingfour Like the app
len ratingfive Moving drawings docs and files work best with the drive

len ratingfive Probably is the only convenient way to upload all my pictures from my phone and be able to access it from my computer 
len ratingfive A great way to share any image and files with friends and family 
len ratingfive College student friendly 
len ratingfive Work friendly 
len ratingfive Only limitation is when I use it so often I wish for more space and you need to pay for that 
len ratingfive Usually in that case I just do a clean up day 
len ratingfive Something to keep in mind is that this more so a share space and temporary storage 
len ratingfour Viewing C C files is unsupported and there aren t any really good text viewers editors for iOS 
len ratingfive  Everything synced perfectly and there isn t any B S and no malicious activity 
len ratingfive Outstanding great backup everything easily found the absolute best across the board
len ratingfive With the wide app availability across computers and mobile devices Google Drive s convenience is hard to beat 
len ratingfive I use Drive EVERY day for work school and personal life 
len ratingfive I not only like it but I rely on it 
len ratingfive I would take this over Drop Box and iCloud any day 
len ratingfive  Pretty good app 
len ratingfive I m a college student and have an excessive amount of documents to keep this makes it easy to access in my phone and a conveniently organized way to keep everything in one place and have it on the go 
len ratingfour Google has a whole slew of useful apps but I find this one my go to whenever I have to find something 
len ratingfour I love the user interface but it would be nice to be able to open forms to edit in an app instead of trying to do it through Chrome 
len ratingfour Everything else that I open opens in the applicable app or this app 
len ratingfour Great work Google 
len ratingfive I lost my phone and couldn t be recovered but I found I still had all my drive really a lifesaver
len ratingone So it gets a Star

len ratingfour  Google Drive is great for online storage 
len ratingfour I save all my important documents and pictures on it 
len ratingfour It s also very inexpensive if you need some extra storage space 
len ratingfour I do not like the fact they took away the password lock to get into the app 
len ratingfour Makes no sense why you would get rid of that feature 
len ratingfour Other than that it serves its purpose 
len ratingtwo  Ya no est Disponible la opci n de la Contrase a y era algo que me convert a en un fiel seguidor de la aplicaci n
len ratingfour I like using drive as a reading tool 
len ratingfour I just wish it had add a annotation capabilities on the PDF s

len ratingfive I love Drive it is so easy to use 
len ratingfive gDrive is the bee s knees 
len ratingfive So useful for collaborative projects it is

len ratingfive  By far the most functional of all cloud storage apps 
len ratingfive I particularly enjoy the ease with which I can customize sharing settings 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive Can now access my files anywhere its great 
len ratingthree Please when people upload a file make sure it s in its original quality and size
len ratingfive This app is so great and awesome 
len ratingone Google drive is supposed to be free and it was on icloud I got charged dollars and I can t even get a refund because it doesn t say on my purchase history that I bought anything it even did this when I downloaded Google Earth I am not happy because it said I bought something but I didn t it charged me dollars for a free app 
len ratingfive I m not sure how I ever lived without access to my files love this on iPad phone and desktop 
len ratingfive I really like it 
len ratingfive It helps me to share a huge files with others 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive  Always comes in handy

len ratingfour It is a great resource for me and I think you would like it to 
len ratingfive Absolutely love it 
len ratingfive It makes teaching so much easier 
len ratingfive  We could manage our own google drive folders easily 
len ratingfive Additionally it s convenient to uni students 
len ratingthree Was debating whether I should give this app or stars because it truly is a great app but the removal of the passcode is annoying which is the main reason I got it for privacy 
len ratingthree Other than that the app is great and easy to use
len ratingtwo The app needs to have the passcode option back especially for older iOS versions that don t support Apple Files 
len ratingtwo Don t quite support the silent move on Google s part 
len ratingfive  Needs a replay button I hate to press the play button all the time
len ratingone Make it so it can save apps too like games 
len ratingone I don t want to lose my game progress
len ratingfive Opening saving downloading files onto my iPhone as easy as on my macbook
len ratingfive  Like it
len ratingfive I can t describe how this makes my life easier 
len ratingfive Loving it 
len ratingfive One of my most used apps 
len ratingfive The app does it s job 
len ratingfive No surprises here
len ratingfive Love the ease of using Drive on all my devices 
len ratingone Not opening on iphone
len ratingfour Nice to have a separate place for your Pictures
len ratingtwo Last replacement Google drive application with Sync application made drive use cumbersome and inconvenient
len ratingone Anything that my school makes me use I hate
len ratingone  Doesn t allow me to select folders to save for offline viewing 
len ratingone Therefore useless 
len ratingone Not able to markup or comment on files or fill out PDF forms for that matter
len ratingfour I am getting sick and tired of seeing years immediately following the number in regards to the way Google versions this app and their productivity apps too 
len ratingfour Please bring back real version numbers so we at least have a rough idea of how far along you guys are progressing insofar as the bug fixing process is concerned too 
len ratingfive I can access my files on my Mac iPhone Chrome book and Windows systems 
len ratingfive Works great and I have had no issues 
len ratingfive Love it easy across all of my devices

len ratingfive Also love that I can easily switch between accounts 
len ratingthree On my team I make the folders and maintain their organization 
len ratingthree On my Google Drive the shared folders are all at the top and other documents are below them in alphabetical order 
len ratingthree On my colleagues Google Drive the shared folders are all mixed in with the documents 
len ratingthree I wish their folders were organized like mine the author of the folders 
len ratingthree When documents and folders are shared to me from others they are all over the place and I have to look closely to find them 
len ratingfive Drive has been a godsend for my Faculty 
len ratingfive Discover this app when my Kodak Printer app stopped working 
len ratingfive Totally satisfied every since 
len ratingfive Ever since I did the new update my Google Drive keeps shutting down after I open the App 
len ratingtwo Pdfs Black out
len ratingfour It s a good app and it just needs a few fine tunes thing to make it best
len ratingfour This feature used to work flawlessly but now not so much 
len ratingfour Only owner edits show 
len ratingfour But the file sharing is great 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive Perfect 
len ratingfour This is getting where things need to be 
len ratingfour Collaboration is so much easier with Drive 
len ratingfour Only a couple of hurdles to jump in my use easier connection with FaceBook and Google Drive Photos and well maybe that s it 
len ratingfive This app is a great easy way to do what you can do from your laptop computer on your phone
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I don t know why everyone in the world would ve use this 
len ratingfive It works perfectly except for not everyone uses it 
len ratingfive For those who do not google drive has ways to share documents with only one more step 
len ratingfive Get it and save yourself and your friends family colleagues time 
len ratingone Pretty common feature with other cloud apps
len ratingfive I only allow the best photos to be placed 
len ratingfive That makes it easy for me to find those photos giving me the most joy 
len ratingfive And once I figured it out sending them out was so simple 
len ratingfive But the main thing is keeping the cookie cutter junk out of your way 
len ratingfive Same is true for my poetry collection 
len ratingfive It is so easy to use and I love how I can view documents across devices 
len ratingone Can t download videos to device 
len ratingone This is the most user unfriendly software since MS DOS HORRIBLE 
len ratingone Very difficult to use 
len ratingone Not user friendly at all 
len ratingone Whose brilliant idea was this 
len ratingone The PIN made sure that I could hand my phone to friends or if my phone was stolen without worrying about them trifling through my personal docs 
len ratingone This app is useless to me now 
len ratingone I will have to log in and log out every time I want to use my files 
len ratingone I might as well move to Dropbox at this point of time 
len ratingone This was such a good app also 
len ratingone What a waste 
len ratingfive For a distributed team
len ratingfour ADAsraAq
len ratingfive Ur that one that is the best
len ratingfour Find this app very helpful when listening to a music file though 
len ratingfour I have not been able to figure out how to access the music file and listen to it from my phone

len ratingfour It is very helpful 
len ratingfive It does what it should 
len ratingfive Great tool when your on the GO GO

len ratingthree My complaint is a new one 
len ratingthree I hate that they ve removed password protection from the Apple iso version 
len ratingthree I store personal info for travel and have a few pics I wouldn t want my children or anyone else seeing in the app 
len ratingthree It s really stinks now that I don t have the extra layer of security
len ratingfive Nesesito la c mara no esta funsionando ke lepasa
len ratingone The app is crap nothing saves nothing opens what happened 
len ratingfour Definitely worth the download

len ratingfive Thanks Google Drive 
len ratingfive Dr Myers Brooklyn NY 
len ratingone Absolutely crazy to take away the passcode lock on the app 
len ratingone Why can t way have the option to add that extra layer of security 
len ratingfive If you are a gmail user it is a must app 
len ratingfive It makes things so easy and seamless 
len ratingfive You can store and organize your email attachments share documents store your private documents too 
len ratingfive It let s you be in control of your own data and privacy 
len ratingone If my iphone goes to sleep there are errors when it uploads 
len ratingone Uploading multiple photos or a video forget it 
len ratingone Wish this would have been solved a long time ago
len ratingfive It s so easy getting where my files are 
len ratingfive It s also helpful because Google Drive keeps all the important stuff
len ratingone  Why did you delete the program PIN 
len ratingfive Everything is awesome 
len ratingfive Everything is cool when your part of a team 
len ratingfive Everything is awesome when your living on a dream 
len ratingone Drive used to be good but That was before Google wanted to take over the internet Now it has glitches and loses documents 
len ratingone Today it asked to store a zip file but it didn t recognize the file type once it was uploaded 
len ratingone Fix what you already have created BEFORE doing anything else please 
len ratingfive Simply Awesome
len ratingone How is there not the option to save multiple files photos to the device in a batch 
len ratingone Rather than having to open the options for every single individual file before selecting the send to and save file options we should be able to select multiple items and do the same steps only once 
len ratingone I m also not a fan of the fact that photos don t save in their original resolution I m not trying to download a preview thumbnail 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive It s awesome it s the best that I have seen very easy to use 
len ratingone Bring back Security Features 
len ratingfive Very nice and convenient way to store files
len ratingfive  Sometimes I can t use this software

len ratingfive It helped me pull my average up by points 
len ratingfive I m a student saying this so I would know 
len ratingfive TRUST ME 
len ratingfive It s so Amazingly helpful

len ratingthree I like this beautiful building because it s looks good 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Minimal effort is put into this product 
len ratingfive Does what it says it does 
len ratingfive Only minor issue that I have is that the sharing can be a bit complex

len ratingone I tried other places in the Cloud and came to Google Drive 
len ratingone I am happy that I did it 
len ratingone The Drive is so swift and easy that after transferring my existing collection of Books I have been busy the last few days looking for more Books in English and Books in languages other than English 
len ratingone I hope I am given enough years to read my new collection 
len ratingone Thanks Google you have won me over 
len ratingone N Subramanian
len ratingfive Took me a long time to finally give it a try 
len ratingfive It is a phenomenal resource that gives you access to all your important files anywhere and at all times 
len ratingfive Sharing function is super useful 
len ratingfive You can download videos to your phone
len ratingfive Perfect 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Very pleased 
len ratingfive This app is great and very portable 
len ratingfive Its an amazing apps for users You should increase drive capacity from free version GB 
len ratingfive This is an expectation from users Regards
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive for over years 
len ratingfive It s reliable convenient and free 
len ratingfive No need to look elsewhere this app is the best free cloud storage app 
len ratingfive Add Google Photos and you ll recover a ton of space on your mobile devices tablets and PC 
len ratingfive Very Good
len ratingfive Without Google Drive Id be so lost with all my content 
len ratingfive Writing on Google Docs leaves Files lost all over the place sloppy and disorganized but with Google Drive Im able to organize all Docs and Pics into Folders with Drive 
len ratingfive Dopest app 
len ratingfour The only thing I would complain is that I still need office 
len ratingfive  Yay thx
len ratingthree  Have to close it in order to refresh and see newly uploaded documents 
len ratingfour  This is good
len ratingthree Add a synonym right click option
len ratingfive It s great and it s free 
len ratingfive What more could ya ask for 
len ratingfour As a student I am constantly using documents slides and Google drive on my IPAD and on my computer 
len ratingfour It is ok its not the same as on the computer but the changes save almost instantaneously Which is awesome for group projects 
len ratingfive Love love love this app

len ratingfive This is awesome for my business 
len ratingfive Excellent for back up and personal document when I was out of the office in a meeting or other stuff 
len ratingfive Congrats 
len ratingfive very useful
len ratingtwo My RTF files are showing up blank and will not show up in a search 
len ratingtwo In order to read an RTF file I have to go via Chrome 
len ratingfive Greatest app ever written analogous to the bible in the book world 
len ratingfive Use this so for pretty much everything easy to use and so convenient
len ratingone  This app will wipe out your extended file metadata if you use it on a Mac 
len ratingone It supports Files theoretically but you will get strange errors and get data loss if you try to create a new file via the Files api in a third party app 
len ratingone Save yourself a bunch of hassles and just go with Dropbox which works better has better apps and is more comparable with a wide variety of apps and services 
len ratingfive Thanks to this I have not needed a USB drive in forever
len ratingfive I really like google drive because I can tips on my phone so it makes it really easy to do it
len ratingfive Tom a while to use it it is a great asset 
len ratingfive I never have a problem using this app 
len ratingfive Cannot say the same about most others I use for storage 
len ratingfive Quick and easy to load and download 
len ratingfive The google drive totally replaces my portable drive and gives me an convenient access to both my Mac and Windows laptop
len ratingfive Sooo nice to have the files I need at anytime provided I can connect to the internet Google has set the standard in cloud computing and storage 
len ratingfive Am I a file pack rat 
len ratingfive You bet 
len ratingfive It certainly beats hands down making room in a thumb drive guessing what s on cd dvd media etc a lot of my issue is laziness and not labeling media though this provides me with anytime access and I can organize the first time my files so I can go straight to them in the future 
len ratingfive On top like a cherry I don t have to worry about backing my files up 
len ratingfive Thanks Google for making my busy life a little less stressful
len ratingfour Drive is a fantastic tool by itself worth stars hands down 
len ratingfour The drive app on my iPad however has some minor quirks here there 
len ratingfour For whatever reason when I open Excel files on my iPad they will be changed sometimes quite dramatically 
len ratingfour Reopening the same files on my laptop afterward columns will be resized and sometimes color will be removed 
len ratingfour I use pop up pictures and one time I thought the quirk had removed all of them 
len ratingfour Fortunately they were saved and all changes were only structural and not of the content 
len ratingfour Super great app to have access to my files whenever I have my iPad with a few minor issues just with Excel as far as I ve seen 
len ratingfour Highly recommend 
len ratingone It s confusing
len ratingfive Awesome thank
len ratingfive Drive offers the solution to issues we didn t even anticipate 
len ratingfive Just WOW 
len ratingone Google review and be in a local guide as a level for urns are you free storage up to TB I don t know why my account doesn t reflect that I did my part they haven t done their part by awarding me for writing all the reviews I did

len ratingfive I use this to swap documents between work and home 
len ratingfive Lots of capacity 
len ratingfive Easy to access 
len ratingfive Easy to organize 
len ratingfive I was able to convince my wife to share docs across the web 
len ratingfive Great app

len ratingfour I can attach a resum to an email and send it using my phone 
len ratingfour I ve even done it in an office before an unexpected interview 
len ratingfour Safe relatively secure and portable across multiple devices PC tablet and phone 
len ratingfour Going through Apple s Files app it says Item under all my folders 
len ratingfour I have more than that in all my folders 
len ratingthree Don t like that there s now a separate app for google photos 
len ratingthree The point for me was less space taken up on my devices 
len ratingthree No thanks 
len ratingtwo Uploading a minute video takes as long as a minute video well over an hour and yes I have tried in several different WiFi networks

len ratingfive My drive has prove to be very easy to use 
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfour I love Google Drive 
len ratingfour I trust Google in general way to much 
len ratingfour But this app is almost perfect 
len ratingfour My only complaint is that you can t edit slides or docs without downloading the slides or docs apps 
len ratingfour I personally don t have much storage so downloading two extra apps is not helping my case 
len ratingfive The best assistant I ve ever had 
len ratingfive When I m in a bind Google Drive never fails me 
len ratingfive Again like I said it s like having one of the best assistance right at your fingertips 
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingfive If you like Apple but don t want to convert to their cloud products Google Drive is the way to go 
len ratingfive I honestly don t know what I would do if there wasn t Google Drive 
len ratingfive It does everything I need it to and then some not to mention the ability to access it on anything anywhere anytime 
len ratingfive Biggest bonus it s free 
len ratingone  They have done most stupid thing that s ever been done 
len ratingone Took away password lock option 
len ratingone That alone caused me to delete app 
len ratingfive SuperEasy 
len ratingfive Iz gud

len ratingfive I don t know how I got along before it 
len ratingfive Functional 
len ratingfive  I want to play eve
len ratingfour The only thing I wish that it had and kept the th star off was the ability attach photos etc to already saved document along with the ability to edit and change docs that are saved to google docs

len ratingfour Please allow this app to take up less Space
len ratingfive Love you google 
len ratingfive  Melhorou a forma de como se guarda arquivos principalmente fotografias 
len ratingfive With Google Drive the limitation that is experienced in email attachment of large file is now a distant past 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree If only there was a better way the tag images with more than star 
len ratingthree Tag them with colour etc 
len ratingthree Also wish you could restrict the search function to just within this folder or this folder and other folders within it 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfive It s so simple to operate 
len ratingfive Absolutely amazing 
len ratingfive Easy to use and works great every time 
len ratingone I loved this app and the passcode lock gave me the on top of apple s passcode comfort to store some of my personal documents

len ratingfour Pretty good not great Google makes everything dump people friendly
len ratingfour  It s great thanks so very much for the help and I m glad you have this app
len ratingfive  One of the best things I have the homer to use and I adore this s app 
len ratingfive Great for traveling you can copy whole folders with hundreds of files into GD and them use them as your master files while traveling just drag the folders into GD and all their files copy And for any file in GD you can also choose to keep a copy on your device in case you go offline gig free pretty good 
len ratingfive So far using it for travel instead of a flash drive and instead of Dropbox where editing files gets messy but may will use it as my main folder if it continues to work as well as it s been working so far 
len ratingtwo Too many unsupported file types with no help on how to convert them 
len ratingfive Files are always there for me and my clients 
len ratingfive Able to listen to my lectures anytime anywhere 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate 
len ratingfive I like it very much 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Works great just make sure to copy links into internet if sent from different apps not just open directly or won t work
len ratingfive I use this app for personal and professional productivity 
len ratingfive Collaboration made and access made easy 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Really enjoy how flexible this is and what it does for the sake of humanity 
len ratingfive It will revolutionize everything 
len ratingfive EVERYTHING 
len ratingfive Muhahahahahaha 
len ratingfive Google rules the world and listens to everything you do 
len ratingfive It predicts things and I have no idea how they know especially when I have a conversation with someone completely independent of anything personally connected to google but when I get back to my device google somehow knows everything 
len ratingfive And when I say everything I mean everything 
len ratingfive It knows more about my wife than I know 
len ratingfive It s scary people 
len ratingfive So scary 
len ratingfive That s why I give google stars out of 
len ratingfive This is cool game
len ratingfive Nice app better than the website
len ratingfive I don t know how I would be able to function without this app 
len ratingfive Great service 
len ratingfive Amazing app for pictures documents storage
len ratingfour I like it 
len ratingfour Just wish it brought pictures up quicker 
len ratingfive Hello to anyone considering what cloud service to use 
len ratingfive Google appears to be the most user friendly across devices 
len ratingfive I use the drive for work and personal and have found it to be very useful 
len ratingfive I like the fact that I don t have to be without any photos or videos that I have stored on the drive 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive Drop box and Apple drive are the ones that should take a lesson from Google on how cloud services should be run 
len ratingfive Works just like it should
len ratingfive There is a bug in offline video player It is hard to quit 
len ratingfive The best cloud drive period 
len ratingfour Podr a ser mejor sin embargo es una herramienta de primera
len ratingfive  Recommended
len ratingfive What a great central place to keep all your files 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Drive 
len ratingfive Glenn M 
len ratingfive I can upload files to the drive and have them be available offline 
len ratingfive How great is that 
len ratingfive  bug G
len ratingfour Don t get me wrong this is a great app and very useful but recently this and the other google apps have been taking up more space 
len ratingfive  Very useful 
len ratingfive Me parece bastante rapida 
len ratingfive Works just as I need it to 
len ratingtwo Que solicitacao oqq nimguem manda email 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate for a beginner like myself 
len ratingfive So many options to help run my start up company 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive  T t
len ratingfive Drive is always working even when you re not having any internet connection 
len ratingfive It always has the best options and it is WAYYY better than Microsoft 
len ratingfive More options and more compatibility 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Microsoft has apps just like google and let me just say google s apps are always better 
len ratingfive  Google Docs is exactly like word but free 
len ratingfive Same thing with other developers like the people who created Dropbox 
len ratingfive Google drive is like dropbox but better 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work google 
len ratingtwo This actually blew my mind 
len ratingtwo When you save a photo through the Google Drive app it saves it at a lower resolution sized to your devices display 
len ratingtwo I assume it also applies more compression but I haven t tested for that 
len ratingtwo This is extremely irritating as I previously used the app to transfer photos from my PC to my iPhone thinking they would be kept as originals 
len ratingtwo I now use iCloud Photo Library to transfer my photos since discovering this a few months ago 
len ratingfive My band uses our gmail address to pass files back and forth 
len ratingfive Pretty sweet deal thanks I also can upload mp scratch recordings so I care share via social media 
len ratingfive I have used this to increase my tools library being invited by friends 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone No clear
len ratingfive The only good cloud backup service I ve used 
len ratingfive I don t use it for backups though I use it for sending files between my devices 
len ratingfive The free GB or so never seems to run out 
len ratingfive It would be great if they made it easier to access my files from computer then having to go through my recent or maybe i just don t know what im doing lol but i love the app personally 
len ratingfour Easy to use and easy to share 
len ratingfive Very cool
len ratingfour would love to have a feature or function to download multiple photos instead of downloading one by one
len ratingfive This is fabulous for file backups and multi platform access to your files 
len ratingfour Google has got it right maybe not in all areas particularly total security but it s something all companies including Apple have to work on 
len ratingfour Ease of use and good options are what make this a really viable choice for storage 
len ratingfive Fire app
len ratingfive I often read the reviews of an app prior to deciding if I will download 
len ratingfive I did not on this particular app 
len ratingfive I just simply started using it 
len ratingfive Then after more than a few months using the app I read the reviews 
len ratingfive I see I do not know how to fully use the app 
len ratingfive The app does everything I have asked of it 
len ratingfive However the reviews clearly show my five is well deserved but I have so much more to learn 
len ratingfive My concern like all online storage and computers is security 
len ratingfive I do not know how security this app is but I suspect it is as vulnerable at GOOGLE allows it to be 
len ratingthree Me gusta pero necesita dar mas gb gratis
len ratingone Google is gathering a ridiculous amount of personal information on its users and people are catching on 
len ratingone I will be deleting my Gmail account my Google drive and anything else google related including Google Chrome 
len ratingone Thanks big brother 
len ratingfive I absolutely love Google Drive 
len ratingfive Google has made it so easy to keep all of my important files in order and very easy to retrieve when I need to do so 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive everyday and have found it to be the best way for me to keep everything in order 
len ratingfive Sync files from your phone to work to home to some Internet cafe 
len ratingfive It s very simple and it always works 
len ratingfive Google drive is the easiest and best way for a teacher to stay organized 
len ratingfive You can access your materials from any device never have to worry about losing an external drive and has so many additional apps programs like Google Classroom Google Forms which helps me grade and Google Slides 
len ratingfive Best cloud drive out there for me 
len ratingfive Integration with Google apps Chrome and Adobe saves me tons of time 
len ratingfive Offline access of documents works 
len ratingfive great for personal use and syncing between different device 
len ratingfive  Wonderful 
len ratingfive Appreciate the ease of access n free storage space 
len ratingtwo The interface is constantly changing 
len ratingtwo The entire system changes far too often 
len ratingtwo It s like it s being developed by year olds 
len ratingtwo I would not use it except I m forced to for work 
len ratingtwo The drive is the best feature of google tools 
len ratingtwo The other apps are worse 
len ratingtwo Sharing is nice 
len ratingtwo But the interface and features ruin that so I can only give it a 
len ratingfive  Love this app
len ratingfive This app gives me the exact access i need to my google drive 
len ratingfive The functions are great and easy to use 
len ratingfive Love the ease with which I can find what I need on any device 
len ratingfour  This app is useful because it s like an office max or word document mobile to have any data stored 
len ratingfour Gives me access to all my docs 
len ratingfive Was on gdrive right from the start and at first it was pretty bad now it s the best 
len ratingfive Google drive is one of the best things to come out of Google 
len ratingfive The only negative is attempting to transfer pictures from Google pictures to FB or IG 
len ratingfive To do that you needed degree in computer science 
len ratingfour I love it and all but I can t save the photos I ve made onto my iPhone 
len ratingfour When I press and hold it only highlights it 
len ratingfour And there s no other way to save them besides going there on Safari
len ratingfive The drive app is really awesome and keeps all of your photos safe and I really enjoy that 
len ratingfive This site is a terrific alternative to the Microsoft open view site 
len ratingfive Trusting the ethical actions of the Google team this site affords the opportunities to share in an OS independent site
len ratingfive  Much needed for me throughout graduate school
len ratingfour Great app but should come with music player for Google Drive embedded
len ratingfive The future is here 
len ratingfive Is not a dream is google drive 
len ratingfive All my stuff online all the time 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingthree There needs to be a passcode to open the app on the iPhone 
len ratingthree also there should be a way to lock a specific file 
len ratingfive Just love having Google Drive on all my devices 
len ratingfive I can carry and access it anytime anywhere and I know it s safe secure and SAVED 
len ratingfive  I like it very much 
len ratingfive Best service with more space
len ratingfive Good idea to say or save time time is money he said it as was that was in my childhood it s true to not off center just cause they say it I just figure cool Northropgrumman future cyber intake flight test computer special new t saber wing check one verify Anton m
len ratingfive Google as usual is the master of quick efficiency and syncing 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive I use this app on my school iPad almost every day
len ratingfive This app is THE BEST if your looking through the reviews trying to think should I get this YOU SHOULD TOTALLY 
len ratingfive You can either do a document a slide and something else I forget it s so good for work school projects and even writing stories if you mind 
len ratingfive I m doing my school project right now on sea turtles and it s going great 
len ratingfive If you spell a word wrong all you gotta do it right click on that word and you get a drop box and at the top it should the word spelled correctly 
len ratingfive Next thing it works on any device yeah that right iPhones iPads computers anything 
len ratingfive This is app is soooo super good totally get you won t regret it 
len ratingone Why won t it let me sign into my school account instead of just automatically signing in my email 
len ratingone I have work that I would like to do at home 
len ratingfive Great app love it

len ratingfive This app is very user friendly 
len ratingfive Great interface and many easy ways to do simple things such as dragging and dropping files copying pasting crating new folders and moving files around 
len ratingfive Never fails
len ratingfive Perfect for team work
len ratingfive It s good again
len ratingfive It s googlicious 
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingfive It s good
len ratingfive Dope
len ratingfive It helped me with my homework and it is really helpful even though I m in elementary I think it s good for college and high school for projects
len ratingfive Love this app easy to use and a great tool for on the go and at home when it comes to organizing documents 
len ratingone  piece of sh t
len ratingfive This is the quickest way for individuals to share work particular when you are not all in the same organization 
len ratingtwo I had a HTC prior to switching back to an iPhone 
len ratingtwo The Google Drive experience with the Android system is entirely unmatched 
len ratingtwo The ability to download multiple photos at once definitely improved my productivity and efficiency 
len ratingtwo That s one feature I would like to see added for iPhone users 
len ratingfive I appreciate the ease of use 
len ratingfive Just love it 
len ratingfive Works Great 
len ratingfive Thank you google
len ratingthree PLEASE fix the glitch that does not allow you to exit viewing a file 
len ratingthree It is extremely frustrating when I m trying to upload and organize folders and I cannot click on an item because then I will need to ex out the entire app and restart it just to go back 
len ratingthree YOU NEED AN X BUTTON 
len ratingthree Please
len ratingone  I had no choice I had to continue with this or not get any email 
len ratingone What a load of crap 
len ratingone Explain it before I have to get this update 
len ratingone I already have Google maps photos etc on my new device 
len ratingthree Drive is a huge asset but some of its functionality could be better 
len ratingfive This app is quite useful 
len ratingfive I am pleased with it and have no complaints at the moment 
len ratingfive I also appreciate that I have enough free space to use as I please and that it integrates well with certain other apps 
len ratingfive I don t know how I ever got along without it 
len ratingfive  I can do my homework here 
len ratingfive Piemel
len ratingfive Easy to back up iPhone
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I think it is a great way for me to access my files at home on my phone instead of at school on my chrome book 
len ratingfive Absolutely genius 
len ratingfour Still great though
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive  I love google drive 
len ratingfive I may have apple but I love google lol
len ratingthree Unlike OneDrive Dropbox or Box google has decided to make working with MS Office docs inconvenient like not letting you search for them 
len ratingfive Works as expected
len ratingfive The best way to share pictures and docs only drawback is when it comes to videos it takes a long time to upload 
len ratingfive Either way the best safe sharing tool out there 
len ratingthree It s a really good app but to upload a picture or especially a video it take a really long long time 
len ratingfive Very reliable love highly recommend to everyone whose loses phones pads tablets or touches 
len ratingfive This does the job
len ratingfive Dope
len ratingfive Great tool work home everything else
len ratingtwo The only reason I download it so I could print it from my phone 
len ratingtwo However it always forces me out whenever I try to print it 
len ratingtwo Maybe there s some bugs 
len ratingfive Awesome and easy to use 
len ratingone It is so bad I m so not satisfied with it at all
len ratingthree I don t know how to write lololololoololololololoo
len ratingfive I love this app because I like to work on school projects at home but I couldn t because I don t have a chrome book but now I can
len ratingone  This app literally fails to open a pdf that is only Mb 
len ratingone The Dropbox app works just fine opening it so it s not an issue with the file 
len ratingfive Great place to securely store your important documents 
len ratingfive They have different types of templates too 
len ratingfive Free storage 
len ratingfour Love google drive great monthly pricing and easy to upload and download on different devices 
len ratingfour My only issue is the creation of multiple versions of the same documents and files 
len ratingfour I use the backup and storage and it regularly makes two and three copies of file 
len ratingfive  good
len ratingfive Very good and I really like the no need of internet to be able to use
len ratingfive I use it for everything
len ratingone I signed up for GoogleDrive bc I needed to send large files to clients online 
len ratingone I was never warned that they would need to have a Gmail account to do so 
len ratingone Then the clients who have Gmail accounts can t download my files off my GoogleDrive links 
len ratingone I ve gone thru each folder changed the settings to EVERYONE has link access to share edit delete they still can t download my files 
len ratingone There is no troubleshooting links I can find online that goes beyond changing the Link sharing to ON 
len ratingone So frustrating I ve about had it with the embarrassment 
len ratingone Thankfully my clients are understanding as I could have very well lost them over this inconvenience 
len ratingfive I use the drive on all my devices 
len ratingfive Works great when traveling or at home 
len ratingfive Drive is a great tool to use when you need access to a document from anywhere including your phone 
len ratingfive I have used this app on my computer for years but the mobile app was missing functionality until last year since then I barely go into the computer app and primary use the mobile 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work 
len ratingfive Money money money ya ya ya ya
len ratingfour Love the access from all my devices 
len ratingfour And not having the dreaded thumb drive 
len ratingfour I can edit my work and see it on everything 
len ratingfour Just wish I had more storage space 
len ratingfour  super easy to use
len ratingfive  good
len ratingfive I really love this app it s extremely capable and keeps me mobile 
len ratingfive A 
len ratingone Don t just walk away assume your loved photos are safe because I could have lost so many if i hadn t followed up 
len ratingone Only of my videos uploaded 
len ratingone I guess it took so long somehow my multitasking was closed 
len ratingone Or you have to leave it open because it doesn t run in multitasking 
len ratingone Also very slow 
len ratingone Also it filled my entire Iphone gb with my drive which I thought was NOT supposed to live in your device 
len ratingone I couldn t add anything to phone files for weeks while Drive sat there filling up my iphone 
len ratingone Which runs horribly with google apps 
len ratingone Idkw 
len ratingfour The app is insisting on a review so here it is Drive is an excellent app for doing documents in the cloud the Google Way 
len ratingfour I have been using G drive for awhile now it s fantastic
len ratingfive I would give it a star 
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingfive I can now always do my homework easily on the go instead of doing it on my laptop it is simple and you can do things on the go
len ratingfive Herramienta b sica Ayuda out tener provecho de todas las funciones es indispensable tenerla
len ratingfive Than iCloud Drive 
len ratingfive Way easier 
len ratingthree How the HLL do you log out 
len ratingthree I m using my iPhone app 
len ratingthree And there is no visible way to log out 
len ratingthree I can just close the app but logout 
len ratingthree I know there must be a way to do it but where have they hidden it 
len ratingthree Arrrrgh 
len ratingfive Safe me lots of time grime losing all my data
len ratingfive This works well on iOS 
len ratingfour I d give five stars if videos would always offer playback speed options 
len ratingfour Ex 
len ratingfour YouTube lets you playback X speed but on my iPad I can only watch regular speed on videos 
len ratingfive Great tool to navigate various apple and windows environments 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Only works sometimes
len ratingfive Universal for all docs repository
len ratingfive So good because it goes from your computer to your phone
len ratingfive With using gmails and other mail accounts you should have this app it can prevent any ways of sharing your personal information and a very easy way to share send and receive any thing that you can by technology 
len ratingfive Hope they keep making the UI easier and easier to use and lower the storage cost and keep raising the currently slow upload speed 
len ratingfive My Google drive allows access to my data for personal and work 
len ratingfive I could not live without it 
len ratingfive What else could you want 
len ratingtwo Why all the functionality of this app is not available on iPhone is just sad 
len ratingtwo But there are other apps for that

len ratingfive It s a good app 
len ratingtwo  Ok I d love to hear the reason for such a feature to be removed 
len ratingtwo Seriously who s the genius at Google that figured this would be an improvement 
len ratingtwo Well I guess Google doesn t really value the security of our documents and files all that much anymore 
len ratingone Stop
len ratingfive So much better than iBooks
len ratingthree Google Drive works okay as a standalone app but I am very unhappy with how it works in the Files app from Apple 
len ratingthree I always see an error when I use Pages and try to create a new document in a Google drive folder 
len ratingthree When I restart Pages and navigate to the same folder the file will actually be there Just today I had an incomplete listing of folders in the Files app and there is no way to force a refresh of the folders listing 
len ratingthree I hope that Google and Apple work things out 
len ratingthree  I don t like how this app and all google apps are not for the Apple Watch and if all apps were I would rate it stars
len ratingtwo It s good but maybe you could add an option to link things to google photos
len ratingfive It s a really handy app that allows me to pull up files whenever and wherever I need them

len ratingfive This is a fast efficient way for me when it comes to uploading and turning in my college assignments 
len ratingthree I can t edit any of my documents 
len ratingthree What s he point of having all of the app if I can t edit and only view 
len ratingthree If I have an assignment I need to turn in or I need to double check something or send something than the app has a use 
len ratingthree So I guess a is a good enough rating 
len ratingfour Couldn t give it and a half but I would if I could 
len ratingfour It s a great app to manage all of your files and it s very accessible 
len ratingfour It s easy to view your stuff and is good for school but I have one complaint 
len ratingfour Whenever I want to open a file it opens in the separate Google Docs app 
len ratingfour This is kind of a bummer because I would prefer to only have one app for all this and consequently it takes longer to load 
len ratingfour I know there s some super logical explanation for it it s just a little inconvenient and takes up more space on my phone 
len ratingfour Overall however it s a great app certainly easier than going to the website and I d recommend it any day 
len ratingfive I Love google drive

len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingfive Having access to my documents from my phone or other device anywhere anytime is great
len ratingone When I download content sometimes entire pieces are missing 
len ratingone For instance ALL a the text from a Microsoft Word Document will be gone but the background picture is there 
len ratingone Or a table is missing from a report 
len ratingone Although other times the entire document is loaded just fine it is very frustrating when I can t view or edit my own papers on hand like this app claims to allow me to do 
len ratingone Thumbs down 
len ratingfive Don t really wanna write a review but I wanna appreciate the fact this free service keeps all my files pictures documents pdf videos slideshows etc in a safe place

len ratingfive I trust the reliability of the Google cloud out of any other to store the things I need to 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive The best app
len ratingfive Google drive is great
len ratingtwo Excuse for file management 
len ratingfive Been using google drive for years now 
len ratingfive Glad there s an app for it 
len ratingfive  I can t think of anything wrong with it 
len ratingfive It s amazing 
len ratingfive Reliable and fast
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive Works as advertised always available from everywhere 
len ratingfour Does what it s supposed to
len ratingfive Great app just great
len ratingfive Thanks for the Application
len ratingfive Google drive is the best 
len ratingfive I can access it from anywhere any platform 
len ratingfive  stars
len ratingfive Extra storage space for my phone love it 
len ratingfive No competition 
len ratingfive Wow 
len ratingfive Thanks for all the space 
len ratingfive Easy to do large file transfers 
len ratingfive Nice interface as well 
len ratingfive Thanks again Google 
len ratingthree The app itself is very useful but there are a lot of glitches and problems in the coding that makes it hard to use 
len ratingthree For instance if you re scrolling through Photos every time you rest your finger on one of the photos it has you select it and it is very hard to unselect it 
len ratingthree Another problem is you have to get separate apps for Google Dr Google docs google sheets and Google slides instead of having it all in one app 
len ratingfour When I need to send a volume of pictures videos or documents it is very easy to put in this cloud and forward the link to a specific folder that recipients can retrieve and share 
len ratingfour It works for me is there handy and secure 
len ratingfour My only draw back is that I still have difficulties dealing with this application interface which I find not so intuitive 
len ratingfour I recently had to upgrade storage because I could not load a big file even after deleting a lot of my stored stuff 
len ratingfour The cost of storage with google is very reasonable cheaper that the competition 
len ratingfour At some point finally a warning popped up telling me that the file was too big 
len ratingfour I did not know that Google drive also stores my mail and I need to do some house cleaning of my gmail to free space 
len ratingfour There is room for improvement 
len ratingone I d like to be able to write docs from the app 
len ratingfive i like it
len ratingfive Google Drive Rocks 
len ratingfive Great for AV storage and sharing 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Google makes all their apps 
len ratingfive Reliable easy to use 
len ratingfour This app is awesome 
len ratingfour I use it so often 
len ratingfour It s a great way to transfer files quickly 
len ratingfive Tiene funciones admirables f ciles de usar y est dotado de caracter sticas profesionales 
len ratingfive This allows me to access my files from anywhere 
len ratingfive As a student Gmail it gives no bad things you must get it if u like my ipian
len ratingfive  Can always be better 
len ratingfive I can keep going and going with this app 
len ratingfive I have used this app since my very first phone and believe I have tried the forbidding FRUIT Not for me 
len ratingfive It s one of my very favorite apps 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and find whats been saved with a easy way to find what has ever been saved to it 
len ratingfive I Got TO DRIVE 
len ratingfive  or 
len ratingfive In my previous office we used Microsoft Office Outlook and Box for file storage sharing and editing 
len ratingfive Box edit works but is super clunky and hopeless for real time document editing 
len ratingfive Google Drive just works better across a shared workspace environment with Google docs for group editing commenting comment resolution taking etc 
len ratingfive Perhaps even more importantly Google Drive and Docs and Sheets are a great way to collaborate across operating systems 
len ratingfive My office is half Apple and half Windows environment in HQ and about in our international offices 
len ratingfive Google is platform agnostic I use Drive and their office suite from my iPhone iPad Windows desktop and iMac 
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingfive The one area where I still prefer Microsoft is for email 
len ratingfive Gmail is just not sophisticated enough for enterprise use 
len ratingfive We are stuck with it in my office and all use different workarounds 
len ratingfive I ve been waiting for a decade for gmail to have half the functionality of Outlook 
len ratingone What s the point of removing a feature of the app forcing users to download another app while still leaving the tab used to access said feature in the first app 
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingfive Cloud service to go when it comes to storing speed and sharing period
len ratingfive I am the product 
len ratingfive And if I do say so myself I am one star brother trucker 
len ratingfour I like this for school and now for info from my coach
len ratingfive is very very good i love this app
len ratingfive It s very nice apps I love it
len ratingone You took out the passcode lock numbskulls 
len ratingfive Google s done it again taking Cloud technology to new heights by providing its users with the software tools they need to organize and share their data among others 
len ratingfive I would recommend Google Drive for beginners casual tech folk and computer experts alike 
len ratingfive Or for working with others
len ratingfive Help with the loads of pictures
len ratingfive Awesome app really simple and resourceful especially in college
len ratingfive It takes me to any google app 
len ratingfive Use it all the time 
len ratingfive Many reasons why 
len ratingone I used to use this all of the time to move images from my pc to phone but now all of my images are becoming low res 
len ratingone This isn t an issue with anything else because they re completely fine on my pc but when I view them on my phone they re smaller files 
len ratingone On my pc they re x and on my phone they re x Fix this 
len ratingfive Best way to transfer stuff from your Pc Email onto your iPhone 
len ratingfour System enables access from multiple platforms 
len ratingfour That makes it easier to keep things up to date 
len ratingfive Nice place to keep docs set aside for when you need them
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive I use Drive for my business and it comes in handy ALL the time

len ratingfive Thank you google for creating such an amazing app We love how it is online and right there when you need it Love Co
len ratingfive There s just nothing like an app set of apps that just do what they should and always do 
len ratingfive This app does everything that it says that is will do 
len ratingtwo I m a college professor and love that I can access my files from anywhere 
len ratingtwo I mostly save teaching notes and answer keys that I use in the classroom during a class 
len ratingtwo The only problem is quite often it takes forever to open a file or if it opens the file pinch to zoom won t work and I ll just see a white screen or worse it ll just force close so you ll see the document for about seconds and then your back on your home screen 
len ratingtwo Sometimes you can only see of pages 
len ratingtwo All of these problems have happened on my iPhone s and still occur even now on my iPhone plus 
len ratingtwo It s been going on for several years off and on thru many different updates including this one in January it s quite aggravating that it s not dependable 
len ratingtwo If you absolutely must have something DO NOT depend on this app 
len ratingtwo Have a backup plan 
len ratingtwo Oh and in case you re wondering not only does this happen on the colleges wifi it happens at home on my very reliable high speed Verizon FIOS connection 
len ratingone Non transparency with release notes 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive So easy to follow and find 
len ratingfive Highly recommended
len ratingfive Grateful for this 
len ratingfive Makes everything so easy on your phone on the go 
len ratingfive Highly recommend it 
len ratingfive I am an Independent consultant for Perfectly Posh and this app makes it very easy for me to share with my team and with my clients
len ratingfour Works well for storing retrieving and sharing using a desktop computer 
len ratingfour Mostly fails to download large PDFs on an iPhone 
len ratingfive I like this app 
len ratingfive But the only problem is I don t know how to download music 
len ratingfive Some music app have to download music from Google Drive or Dropbox 
len ratingfive I have no problems at this time since the updates fixed them all 
len ratingfive I love and trust this source which I use for multiple things
len ratingfive Easiest way to draft refine and share work with my team 
len ratingfour Seriously 
len ratingfive Very nice and handy to have everything I need from google on my phone 
len ratingfive I believe that google is really like a god in many ways 
len ratingfive If you have a question you ask google 
len ratingfive If you need to get somewhere you use google 
len ratingfive If you want blessings beyond your wildest dreams google can also help you with that 
len ratingfive In the future google may evolve into an all knowing all seeing all powerful supercomputer that loves mankind as a creation of his own and serves him as a god would 
len ratingthree Takes to long and pause to play any file
len ratingfive I recommend this app 
len ratingfive It s SOO easy to use and instead of saving it every time you edit something google drive saves it automatically 
len ratingfive The color changing button and font changing button and everything else is very simple to use 
len ratingfive You can add transitions to make things cooler and there are different templates like MLA science report and photo album etc 
len ratingfive You can make a slideshow document or site and many other types of presentations 
len ratingfive You also can also mostly easily upload things onto google drive it s lot easier than other apps like it 
len ratingfive You can also share send your presentations them to other people with an account 
len ratingfive If you want a simple easy to use presentation making app this is the PERFECT app to use 
len ratingfive This app always works 
len ratingfive Very easy to setup and use 
len ratingfive Love it so far 
len ratingfive Great app to work with when keeping everybody in the loop and on top of things 
len ratingfive Highly recommend this app if you don t already have it 
len ratingfive Provides fast easy access to the files in your Google drive even on my old iPhone S 
len ratingfive I love using this app for school purposes as it is so easy to use 
len ratingfive Although I would like to make a recommendation add a button where you can loop music and it can pretty much play forever 
len ratingfive amazing app thnx google for this drive
len ratingfive Google once again sets the standard 
len ratingfive Nothing compares 
len ratingfive You need this application 
len ratingfive I can look at everything I have made and edit it all
len ratingfive This

len ratingfive Works well 
len ratingfour Gets the work done
len ratingone I was so happy we converted to drive at work and when we decided I shoulda download to my iPad so that I could update files from anywhere i was thrilled 
len ratingone Mobility comes at a HUGE price with this 
len ratingone No undo can t even view the entire document or spreadsheet and I have no idea why 
len ratingone Half of my pro screen is grey 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Waste of my time and energy 
len ratingone My iPad is lighter than my laptop and easier to use in general looks like I have to lug the laptop around though 
len ratingone I can honestly say this is the first time I have ever written an app review like this 
len ratingone I am so disappointed 
len ratingfive It helps me out now that I m teaching US History 
len ratingfive I can deposit school materials and have access to all of them instantly
len ratingfive I use my G drive for all my personal and business documents spreadsheets and PDFs
len ratingtwo The pictures I download to my computer through Drive never show up on any other device very frustrating
len ratingthree Needs easier and more instructions to use 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingthree I noticed recently when attempting to search within an extensive document for a keyword I was unable to pull up any type of search bar 
len ratingthree I can do the simple control F on a computer and that works just fine 
len ratingthree On the iPad when I click on the three dots in the top right corner there is no search feature available 
len ratingthree I switched to Google Drive because my company WiFi accepts Google Drive not Dropbox 
len ratingthree The main difference I have noticed is Dropbox provides the ability to scan in PDFs as well as search within the document 
len ratingthree I m not sure if I am missing something obvious when attempting to search within the document 
len ratingthree Can you please shed some light 
len ratingfive Excelent tool best of the best
len ratingfive Genial para guardar todo lo que necesites 
len ratingone I have two google email accounts and a friend sent an email with a link to images on her google drive 
len ratingone No matter what account I switch to it keeps asking me to get permission 
len ratingone I have clicked the link to ask permission and you would think that I have it since I was sent a link 
len ratingone  but it s a week later and I still can t see the images my friend is trying to show me 
len ratingone And there s no one to call for tech support 
len ratingone If I could give minus stars I would 
len ratingtwo My spreadsheets aren t opening properly 
len ratingtwo That can screw up a day in the field quickly

len ratingfive Google drive is the best app to use for all types of files and things you need to keep in one place 
len ratingfive The best part is that it is harder to run out of space than it is to find your documents 
len ratingfive All essentials stay in one convenient location 
len ratingfive Yes excellent
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Google docs is a very helpful writing app 
len ratingfive I think everyone should use google docs and google apps to do typing projects 
len ratingfive this is amazing for multiple reasons 
len ratingfive Number one it makes for great presentations slides Reports essays spreadsheets and etc 
len ratingfive Number two Google Drive makes it easy to share with your friends Family teachers bosses and peers 
len ratingfive Number three google makes it very easy to title delete rename re organize and etc 
len ratingfive Drive keeps myself and my team organized 
len ratingone I wish that the folders I have synced to my drive would automatically show the documents on it in my drive 
len ratingone Instead I have to go to my recents and look for it 
len ratingthree I like Google Drive and use it along with my kids for storing and sharing many docs 
len ratingthree However many of the apps on the iPad only allow back ups and exports as pdf or rtf files 
len ratingthree That knocks out a lot of usability for us since PDFs are not as editable 
len ratingthree It makes Dropbox and OneNote more viable options 
len ratingfive It s easy to use 
len ratingfive And it s safer than IBooks 
len ratingfive Makes getting documents easy from any platform 
len ratingfour My only complaint is that you can t move something on the left to the right 
len ratingfour Other than that this app will save your life
len ratingfive I m not sure you can expect much more from an app that allows you to see all the drive stuff on your tiny phone 
len ratingone Look google is proverbial lb gorilla 
len ratingone Good idea bad execution
len ratingone So I was trying to upload images and had tapped upload to upload files when Drive choose that moment to show the pop up Enjoying Drive So I went with it and tapped no send feedback The alert disappeared and after a few seconds of waiting nothing seemed to happen so I went back to trying to upload 
len ratingone Then the native star review sheet popped up 
len ratingone So here we are 
len ratingfive Thanks to Google Drive it is far easier to organize my papers and shared documents in one easy space 
len ratingfive The functionality is also fantastic 
len ratingfive Awesome saves my work
len ratingfive Pretty amazing and goood
len ratingfive Signs in right away and super quick
len ratingfour Google Drive is nearly a fully functioning cloud integrated with document creation and management of files 
len ratingfour It s great in almost every way and the most ambitious of any cloud except that it s slower than other cloud operations and has a few more glitches than some other clouds 
len ratingfive Is a
len ratingfive From sharing file to friends to looking up documents that I filed a long time ago this app stored everything
len ratingone I m unable to export videos from my google drive please fix that now 
len ratingfour  Great way to have access via all your devices anywhere 
len ratingfour Sometimes it is slow to load using my iPhone 
len ratingfour Also there is a delay at times with upload from one device and visibility of the file by another 
len ratingfour Overall very satisfied 
len ratingfour Nice way to keep organized
len ratingone It couldn t even find my account when I entered it right 
len ratingfive I dare u to make google drive better than notability
len ratingfive Google brings great tools and this one is no different one place you can share store things that you can retrieve from any where in the world as far as you have internet and access to computer or phone love this tool
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingfour It s doesn t have random play options 
len ratingone Disappointed reduced my storage

len ratingfive This app is so easy to use and I love it 
len ratingfive I can access my Google Drive anywhere at anytime 
len ratingfive It s fantastic 
len ratingfour It s pretty nice just sometimes there s uploading problems otherwise really good and helpful
len ratingtwo I can t find things in Drive 
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingfive I like it it does my homework
len ratingtwo The big reason for using a cloud drive is to access files on any device 
len ratingtwo This does not work well across PCs or iPads 
len ratingtwo I have to use Dropbox to share files in this manor 
len ratingfive When you don t have internet you can easily make the files available for offline use 
len ratingfive I love to be able to go back to my pics every time I want
len ratingfive This app is very easy to use 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfive They can scan all my documents for ad purposes so long as they securely protect them which they seem to do 
len ratingfive I m happy with the integration among platforms 
len ratingfive Generally it s an awesome product 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive This app keeps me working no matter where I am 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive It is so much easier to access than some of the other clouds 
len ratingfive I can find things I ve saved and create new things right in this app 
len ratingfive I ll never use another cloud as much as I use Google Drive 
len ratingfive This app helps me stay organized in my classroom 
len ratingfive Yay 
len ratingfive Even on my iPhone I can have all my files LOVE
len ratingfive I m always using this app and I just pretty much use it all the time at school to get some stuff finished 
len ratingfive I barely get homework 
len ratingfive Thanks for the awesome load of stuff Google 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive Drives helpful for backing up documents into the files I have still around I like it and wish that they would ensure your privacy first though and then allow you to own or share
len ratingfive I fine it this app to be very useful quick and convenient 
len ratingfive I am not a techie but Yr old grandma with lots of pics of the grandkids 
len ratingfive Now I can keep them all in one place and easily share with others 
len ratingfive Sweet 
len ratingfive C est formidable 
len ratingone Had to download drive just to find out I needed docs too 
len ratingone Waste of time 
len ratingone Could have just done this on my computer 
len ratingone Don t recommend for ipad 
len ratingfive This app is very easy to use 
len ratingfive It works very similar to the desktop version 
len ratingfive I use a iPhone and it works seamlessly 
len ratingfive It is a pleasure to have my files available to me on all of my devices and wherever I go 
len ratingfive They update as I make changes 
len ratingfive It is tremendous 
len ratingfive Like I said Awesome 
len ratingfive Google Drive is the best 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Absolutely Fabulous
len ratingtwo Bring back the password to open feature changed my rating to stars 
len ratingfive Fantastic app would love it if the videos I saved were a little more consistent but overall amazing 
len ratingfive Makes things so easy 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I use drive mainly for keeping all my school documents organized does everything I need and more 
len ratingfive Runs perfectly on iPad 
len ratingfive Easy seamless flawless 
len ratingfive Amesome
len ratingone bad app doesn t work at all
len ratingfive  Tis good
len ratingone I had a large PDF file that I couldn t email so I put it on google drive BECAUSE of that 
len ratingone Because I was under the impression that you could store and access large files 
len ratingone However not only will it not preview because the file is too big it won t open in google drive or any other app I can t share it either because it always says cannot be downloaded or no connection even though it has no problem opening anything else 
len ratingone Please fix this as I wasted over an hour and a half scanning pages into PDFs for no reason 
len ratingfive I absolutely love google
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingthree Syncing seems to be inconsistent 
len ratingthree Accessing from one device to another can be challenging 
len ratingthree Not sure how to force proper behavior 
len ratingfive Very nice
len ratingfive I m a student in MD and i think it is good 
len ratingfive Love being able to grab and drop pdf s no hassles 
len ratingfive Easy as pie love it 
len ratingfive This share drive is very practical for my congregation elders it helps us to stay in touch with various important task and know what events are scheduled 
len ratingfive I use G Drive every day 
len ratingfive It is like a big hard drive that I can access anywhere from any device 
len ratingfive Great for collaborating with colleagues and for storing working documents to keep refining 
len ratingfive Useful
len ratingfive Never had an issue satisfied
len ratingfive Just plain perfect
len ratingfive Convenient and multi functional 
len ratingfive And Outstanding And Free
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Es una aplicaci n noble y una de las mejores en su tipo 
len ratingfive good app
len ratingfive Best program ever 
len ratingfive And easy to use 
len ratingfive I never have problems with this program either on the computer or phone it is very efficient 
len ratingone If it s not broke you shouldn t fix it 
len ratingfive I m a high school teacher and I love that I can keep all my school and personal files separate 
len ratingfive Plus it s easy to organize and I can I find things easily 
len ratingfive And it goes where I go 
len ratingfive I love Google drive as a service and this app is a great user interface for Drive 
len ratingfive It makes working in a cloud easy 
len ratingfive I use it routinely 
len ratingfive Great performance and speed deserved
len ratingfive This bessssssssst 
len ratingfive I have done my homework by this 
len ratingfive Does what I need it to
len ratingone I have a school account with full team drive access on every other platform but this app will not let me access my team drives 
len ratingone These are extremely helpful for undergrad and grad studies with teams 
len ratingone I need access to my team drives for this app to be worth anything more than star 
len ratingone Otherwise the app runs very smoothly 
len ratingfive Say what you want about Google but nothing out there comes close 
len ratingfive Best Ever
len ratingfive This app is more useful than the entire phone that houses it 
len ratingfive Been a staple for my sart up ideas 
len ratingfive All this none have worked yet 
len ratingfive I hant lost anything ether thanks google 
len ratingfive Very good app to organize my Docs or Slides 
len ratingfive This will come very handy if you use a lot of the Google Programs
len ratingfive Just the best platform possible
len ratingfive This is the one of best tools tools that google has you can share information with everyone that u email I recommended
len ratingone Always room for improvement
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingfive I can easily open and pull up resume check list presentations from keynote integration on my google driveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
len ratingfive This is excellent medium for storing and sharing project documents between multiple consultants and working stations 
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingone I am very disappointed that you can no longer passcode protect this app 
len ratingone It means that if the phone is accidentally left open that someone can t easily view anything stored in Google drive 
len ratingone There is no option in settings to set up a passcode for the drive 
len ratingone If you are considering using this drive be forewarned that anyone can say anything you store in this drive if your phone manages to be left open 
len ratingone They can simply tap the app and open it 
len ratingthree I love Drive for the most part but am frustrated by their recent move to disable passcodes 
len ratingthree Why am I only allowed one level of security my phone passcode 
len ratingthree It s seems that with the rampant data breaches we should be adding layers of security not removing them 
len ratingone Google was once number one in most areas 
len ratingone Their inability to make a service for cloud storage that is fast and convenient is evidentially beyond their capabilities 
len ratingfive Another good product from Google
len ratingfive Easy 
len ratingfive Safe 
len ratingfive A lot of Space 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive I share scans photos audio oh yeah and work together on documents 
len ratingfive It has been a staple in my toolbox for quite a while 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I have an iPhone which charges you for almost every app that actually does something you might need 
len ratingfive But this app was free and does so much 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I never give any app five stars but this one deserves it 
len ratingfive The google drive app lets you use google docs slides sheets classroom and more without WiFi say you are on a road trip or a train or plane and you want to write or do something on google classroom 
len ratingfive You would usually just go to safari which on a plane you wouldn t be able to access and look up I google classroom 
len ratingfive From there you would click on the link and peruse your business 
len ratingfive Using it on the web can create distractions and you might not even be able to be access the web if you don t have WiFi at the time 
len ratingfive With the app which is a great score because it is free 
len ratingfive lets you access docs no matter where you are 
len ratingfive It is an app so it can be accessed without interruptions and blocks 
len ratingfive I personally love this app as I am a writer 
len ratingfive I simply click on the app and magic 
len ratingfive I can write down all of my thoughts and ideas etc 
len ratingfive This app is truly amazing and I recommend you purchase it today 
len ratingfive This app saves me all the time 
len ratingfive I can t live without it
len ratingfive I just love how I can access files from any location and collaborators can edit with multiple file users at the same time 
len ratingone This app lacks the most basic feature that nearly every app has being able to lock the app 
len ratingthree It s helpful because you can see your projects but you can t edit them unless you have the apps 
len ratingfive Excelente aplicacion la recomiendo por su capacidad de almacenaje 
len ratingfive v good
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive Great
len ratingone It d be good if I could use the application in the ipad 
len ratingfive The best storage app out there 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and works with everything 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingthree For documents it works great but the Google Photo feature doesn t always work well 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive thanks
len ratingfive Please bring back the ability to set a password with this app 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive Simple cloud addition 
len ratingfive Can t imagine staying organized without it 
len ratingfive Pretty simple stuff it works 
len ratingfive The best
len ratingfive I am really happy by using google drive 
len ratingone Always has pop ups asking if I like the app 
len ratingone No not with all these ratings pop ups 
len ratingfive Useful
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingfive Easy to work with

len ratingfive Great to know someone out there is always trying to improve the ability to save restore and move pictures with ease 
len ratingfive Thank you for the memories through picture saving 
len ratingfour  I love google drive it s amazing and cool 
len ratingfour But Everytime I preview something in the files app it opens google drive super annoying please fix this
len ratingone It does not support Zip drive files 
len ratingfive I have been utilizing several different applications unknowingly never really concerned with what application I was using 
len ratingfive Well if you have any doubts about this app please know that when everything fails on you and you loose all documents except the documents you have saved with this specific application then you will start paying attention to where your documents and other professional documents or materials are being saved 
len ratingfive I love the app 
len ratingfive I can deal with all the documents anywhere with my phone 
len ratingfive Always available Changes Saved from all my devices
len ratingfive myintmyatzaw

len ratingone  Photos processing For like an hour 
len ratingone Uploading to Drive is such a pain 
len ratingone With Apple s cloud service it s easy 
len ratingone With Drive well Google is a lost and dying company that can t get the simplest app working 
len ratingone The only way I can get this app working is if I upload a couple photos or videos at a time 
len ratingone Who wants to stand around and watch uploads and then select others until all your files are uploaded 
len ratingone Microsoft s cloud service is no better 
len ratingone Guess I ll just stick to Apple since it s seamless and it works 
len ratingone Transferring all my files to iCloud and no longer paying for this horrible service that doesn t work at all 
len ratingfive Google Drive saves lives relationships papers and jobs 
len ratingfive  EDIT ALL WAS FIXED but I didnt find one picture I would use this app for school work and to put pictures from my phone into here so that my phone would have more space 
len ratingfive With the new update there is no longer google photos

len ratingfive Google Drive makes my world a better place
len ratingtwo It doesn t open big files anymore

len ratingfive I really like GOOGLE DRIVE and find it super handy

len ratingfive  This popped right up with all my files 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive A bit tricky to learn but worth the rffort 
len ratingfour I love what drive can do and I love that it is mobile even more

len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive Filling out so I stop getting notified to fill out a review
len ratingfive As the technical director for a Public Radio station featuring an in studio program I often need to send a show edited at home back to the station for broadcast in wav format 
len ratingfive I find Google Drive to be the easiest and most convenient way to share a hour show at the speed of my internet connection 
len ratingfive Once uploaded to Drive simply tag the contact to whom needs wants it and it appears in their inbox to be downloaded 
len ratingfive What could be easier 
len ratingfive With the addition of the player it is possible to listen to what is in my Drive at my leisure

len ratingfive This is a Great application 
len ratingfive Very useful 
len ratingfive Thank you

len ratingfive Thanks Google you make life easier for me 
len ratingfive Easy app does everything I need and more 
len ratingfive  DontBeEvil
len ratingfive Love the storage and organization 
len ratingone I read a lot of the recent reviews of Google Drive and for me personally I don t understand why there are so many positive ones 
len ratingone I find it very inflexible and I have a difficult time finding the files I want 
len ratingone I don t really like its search capabilities and if I didn t already store my files on Google Drive I would not use this app at all 
len ratingfive Love google drive and all google products
len ratingfive I love using Google Drive 
len ratingone Not impressed 
len ratingone I have no idea how to print my document 
len ratingone Sure would be nice if I knew where to get help 
len ratingfive  So sucky it s cool
len ratingfive This app makes my file management so much easier 
len ratingfive Accessing my large files across multiple devices is a breeze and so easy to share a file with friends or colleagues 
len ratingone Google drive makes it impossibly complex to open and edit Microsoft Office documents from Apple devices 
len ratingone Makes it hard to collaborate remotely 
len ratingone Google removed the passcode lock on all of their apps so that means if someone gets access to your device they can rummage around your drive and documents to their hearts content 
len ratingone Better yet Google never notified app users so I found out by having confidential information stolen 
len ratingone Thanks Google 
len ratingone I ve deleted you 
len ratingone I ll find a different way to store info 
len ratingfive This is a great app with plenty of storage space and ability to access anywear Drive has never let me down 
len ratingfive I ve had it for about years and I would suggest this app to anyone it applies to 
len ratingfive One of my most used apps
len ratingfive I have been using the drive app exclusively for quickly storing accessing files between my iPad and desktop 
len ratingfive The ease in functionality has been pivotal in my routine 
len ratingfive So easy to access and use all files when needed 
len ratingfive It s great it works perfect and effortlessly 
len ratingfive Good job Google 
len ratingfive Great integration with google suite 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive Easy to organise
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Enables fluid movement and accessibility to Google Docs on any device 
len ratingfive The app is not quite as robust as using docs on my laptop but it s close and I ve benefitted from the convenience on several occasions 
len ratingfive I can access recipes while shopping my Book Club s reading list and my entire file cabinet of professional documents w ease 
len ratingfive  This app is an excellent tool for School business or personal uses 
len ratingfive It s smooth interface allows the user to view all their files with ease and efficiency 
len ratingfive I ve been using this app for almost six years now and it has never let me down 
len ratingfive Excelente herramienta para administrar mis documentos y obtener acceso en todos mis dispositivos 
len ratingfive Love
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive Practical and effective
len ratingfive I love having access to my files wherever I am 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I ve used G drive for years 
len ratingfive It s quick efficient and reliable 
len ratingfive There may be other cloud storage services with more bells and whistles you can t go wrong with this one 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive Google is the best and will remain best
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Simple and straightforward structure
len ratingtwo Error message stating something went wrong 
len ratingthree What a concept 
len ratingthree Whenever I go to Google Drive to check my photos they are there 
len ratingthree I can t say the same for iCloud 
len ratingfive best thing ever
len ratingfive I have a brand new iPhone and the cloud was full almost immediately 
len ratingfive I ve had google drive since forever and it will always be my go to for photo storage 
len ratingfive Hands down the best 
len ratingfour Frustrating that some files are preview only ex Keynote and cannot be opened
len ratingfive I use google drive and the whole suite of google products daily 
len ratingfive They have replaced Microsoft Office products for me 
len ratingfive Drive is especially useful because it s pretty much a memory stick I can access from any internet connected computer or smart device without needing a physical memory stick 
len ratingfive The integration of drive into my smart devices means I don t have to save things locally any more 
len ratingfive A quick tap and any files I have can be everywhere I need them 
len ratingfive Despu s de yousendit vino Drive a salvarnos la vida porque Box y Dropbox solo que quieran mayor volumen y pagar por poco
len ratingfive I have been using Google drive for a while now sometimes I don t even realize the pictures or files that I need are right there at the tips of my fingertips just by logging into Google Drive from anywhere and it has been a lifesaver more than once in terms of looking for something I needed and I find it 
len ratingfive Also many moments and memories via pictures I thought I had lost forever but realize are stored right there safe and sound in my google drive 
len ratingfive The safety and security are on point and overall thus far Google Drive is Awesome 
len ratingfive It also alerts you for each and every sign in attempt on any device and periodically prompts user to verify and conduct security checks for device sign in and activity review ensuring that everything is done by you the user and also that only you have access to ALL YOUR Information 
len ratingfive Top it all off it s absolutely FREE 
len ratingfive No fees as of yet but even if they were to charge for this service it would be well worth the monetary cost for the peace of mind it provides 
len ratingfive THANKS GOOGLE DRIVE 
len ratingfive Keep it Up

len ratingfive Also I can quickly make changes to my resume and google drive docs has me ready to submit the updated resume in no time 
len ratingfive It cleans up the mess of a paper trail I make in life
len ratingfive Easy to use this app has all my important file from the university

len ratingfive It s much better than accessing my google drive from the internet or the gmail app
len ratingfive I use Drive in professional church and personal work 
len ratingfive I also use it with grandchildren and have a big family project coming up that will be shared on Drive 
len ratingfive It is SO useful and accessible 
len ratingfive Some features are not as intuitive as I would like so I am providing Google Drive lessons for groups with whom I work 
len ratingfive So far it s been pretty soild with my simple needs of video and music storage 
len ratingfive Some pics and some other minor docs 
len ratingfive Not sure how it will handle larger overall storage but for now it s perfect and useable
len ratingtwo Not sure why google changed drive so that you can t search within specific folders but it s greatly decreased the quality 
len ratingtwo That was one of the best features 
len ratingtwo Has made it hard working in the drive 
len ratingfive I use drive daily to keep tract of life and in my teaching 
len ratingfive No more lost documents 
len ratingfive Easy to use and free 
len ratingfive I feel like google docs helps us kids a lot 
len ratingfive We use this on an everyday bases and I would like to see google do more of these apps that we can use for school 
len ratingfive  Moving between devices is nice to have 
len ratingfive I also like the automatic save feature 
len ratingfive It has been stable and simple to use 
len ratingfive I would recommend it to friends 
len ratingfive  cool 
len ratingfive Was able to share files with colleagues

len ratingfive Streamlined 
len ratingfive Organized all my files
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive Had to give a document when I was not at my desk and went to Google Drive and sent it to the person right there and then 
len ratingfive Wonderful to have all of my documents available as needed 
len ratingfive One downside is that it does not sync in time on all of my other devices 
len ratingfive HSF H
len ratingfive Definitely the best and easiest to use online folder 
len ratingfive And I m an Apple man through and through 
len ratingfive But the iCloud folders 
len ratingfive Give a break 
len ratingone Apps that interrupt me to ask for reviews get one star automatically 
len ratingone I am doing actual work and you are getting in the way 
len ratingone It s a disrespectful design 
len ratingone Furthermore trying to trick negative reviews into a private form while sending positives to the App Store is a shady inflation of your score 
len ratingone For all these reasons I give this app a one star review 
len ratingfour Hay
len ratingfive Perfect for my business projects 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone  They refuse to fix the bugs that they have had for the past few years 
len ratingone It tells me that I don t have permission to open files that I create it does this often 
len ratingone Constantly says rate the app I ll give higher when they decided to fix it 
len ratingfive Meh 
len ratingthree Only stars because I m still learning this 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive It been awesome using the drive 
len ratingfive It is very easy to use 
len ratingfour Works fairly well but occasionally fails suddenly and I can t finish my homework
len ratingfive Both convenience and relevance wrapped up in one awesome package making available the various options I would need to access any of my notes folders pictures files etc 
len ratingfive and it allows me to do it efficiently with the work off line
len ratingfive  Una aplicaci n nica
len ratingtwo I have used Google Drive happily for years 
len ratingtwo This latest version however hangs on the login screen 
len ratingtwo If you force it to quit and restart you can sometimes about of the time get past that to access your files but for the most part this version is completely unusable 
len ratingtwo Really hope they get this fixed 
len ratingfive Love using it 
len ratingfive I can switched easily between Google accounts and review the files I have there 
len ratingfive Love how I can email from here as well as view the files 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive  Nice test
len ratingfour I love google drive 
len ratingfour I still have lots to learn on how to use it but it has been a lifesaver for my team 
len ratingfive Works great to share things 
len ratingfive Perfect app to carry and work my documents everywhere 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I can look and see everything I ve saved and it really just puts a smile on my face to see all the weird pictures I have saved on Google Drive 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Can access what I need on both my personal phone android and work phone iPhone 
len ratingfive Having access to my drive from my phone is amazing 
len ratingfive I am currently waiting at an appointment and working to update some files 
len ratingfive Great on the go access with this app 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive I love this 
len ratingfive I can watch my son type his essays and other things in this google drive 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive I made it work and good
len ratingfive Amazing capabilities for collaborating with my team keeping everything in one place and being able to access the content from anywhere I have Internet
len ratingfive This app makes my personal work so much easier by allowing me to access my files anywhere I go since I tend to move from computer to computer a lot
len ratingfive Always grateful to have all my documents spreadsheets at hand whenever wherever I need them 
len ratingfive This app is awesome and provides the convenience of accessing my files anywhere anytime 
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive for iPhone for a few years and I love it 
len ratingfive I like the search option and the file layout 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Very useful program
len ratingfive  PDF 
len ratingfive Great app everything on go unlimited storage
len ratingfive Me hace le vida f cil 
len ratingfive I can retrieve my documents from anywhere 
len ratingfive Plus most job boards uses Drive 
len ratingfive My One Drive account don t populate when I need to upload my resume 
len ratingfive Love having all my work in one spot online 
len ratingfive I wish it was more user friendly with the iPad
len ratingfive Me costaba mucho ordenar los archivos en la pc con las jerarqu as de carpetas y directorios que se iban abriendo cuando quer a tener archivos que usaba cotidianamente o archivos que dejaba de resguardo 
len ratingfive Con drive me resulta mucho m s f cil y tengo disponibles lo archivos donde vaya a trabajar sin tener que llevar mi laptop o pendrive 
len ratingfive Best app ever 
len ratingfive I love google
len ratingfive Great for the inventive
len ratingfive Easy to use and very effective 
len ratingfive What more do you need 
len ratingfive I love anything Google does 
len ratingfive Use all the time
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Great for storage
len ratingtwo There should be easy icons to assist to set up save the files like Dropbox
len ratingfive Thanks for the recent update Google Drive works flawlessly 
len ratingfive I could open the app and listen to offline files for hours with no issue 
len ratingfive I think so many files in here it s crazy
len ratingfive Use drive primarily on my desktops to keep important files synced up on all machines 
len ratingfive App works as intended 
len ratingfive Sometimes I ll save a pic to drive from my desktop so that I can have it on my mobile 
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingfive Really helps me to write and export my things to my teacher whenever it is needed I can also send scripts or projects to my fellow classmates in project too good app 
len ratingfive Google Drive knows de wae 
len ratingfive There is no app better than this one 
len ratingone Won t allow me to download video files from drive 
len ratingone Needs the passcode lock and touchID function back 
len ratingone No logical reason to take this out 
len ratingone Sometimes you let someone use your device but want to restrict certain apps 
len ratingfive Everything is just kind of slept around in one area you should put each part in different tabs on the bottom of the screen what they do in dropbox it would make it such more convenient
len ratingfive I would like a function to see all recent edits but otherwise works good for me 
len ratingtwo What s the point of getting drive if you need the individual apps doc excel etc to edit things
len ratingfive  My band uses the drive to for sharing new material keeping the band schedule song lyrics etc 
len ratingfive I personally use it to have user manuals at my fingertips anytime I need them 
len ratingfive Also storing any other information I might need to have easy access to 
len ratingfive Using it along wit Google Docs is great 
len ratingfour It s great I love it 
len ratingfour Only thing is I seem to have trouble erasing stuff 
len ratingthree  Good app but not worth stars yet they need to make this more usher friendlier 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive  S per 
len ratingthree I d honestly have given this App five stars if it d would have shut the hell up about rating it and writing a review in the middle of me using it 
len ratingfour Love everything about it 
len ratingfour Only thing I d ask for improvement is organization display of files that have been shared with other people 
len ratingfive I use this app to share pictures of my kid with her grandparents and videos 
len ratingfive So useful 
len ratingfive I also use this to transfer data from my pc and iPad no matter where I m at 
len ratingfive So useful 
len ratingfive Google Drive is the best because it is very helpful to store things like files 
len ratingfive If files ever gets damaged or broken I can just use Google Drive
len ratingfive Google Drive is a terrific app and resource 
len ratingthree Why does Google Drive not allow saving FOLDERS for offline access 
len ratingthree I have to use another service for this feature 
len ratingone Won t let me download video
len ratingfive Works great across devices and for collaboration 
len ratingfive I work from San Diego for a retail store in LA and this has made it easy to share files 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT 
len ratingfive Always accessible and easy to use 
len ratingfive I can use this across multiple platforms and everywhere I go 
len ratingfive Absolutely recommend it 
len ratingone was uploading images and the app froze so of course my synced images didn t complete the upload so guess wat i gotta do go back nd select all of my photos and try again 
len ratingone dont install not worth it
len ratingfour Works well on the iPhone S however I do pave difficulty sending large files from it 
len ratingfive Bam 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingtwo I miss the old days where you could hover over an icon and a balloon popped up telling you what to do 
len ratingtwo Ahh good times 
len ratingtwo I m sure this is totally an awesome Google feature I just need more training to use it effectively 
len ratingfive  Convenience and accessibility is what makes it great 
len ratingfive Access to documents and photographs without access to my laptop has been wonderful 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingone  Every mobile phone alway has password protection it doesn t mean no one can touch but sometime someone could use it also when google take out the password on there app it mean who ever touch your phone could see It easily that s the worst thing that goggle did that way Come the private privacy picture google should has better idea to protect there app and costumer privacy 
len ratingfive I use my drive to organize all my files 
len ratingfive Syncs from my desktop to my phone computer all with the app 
len ratingfive Easy to download other apps to be able to edit files 
len ratingfive I have the google docs app but rarely use it 
len ratingfive It s nice that it s there though for when it s needed 
len ratingfive A must have for online files 
len ratingfive When you click download on a website from your phone it s easy to set up drive as your file save source 
len ratingfive Once it s there it ll be super fast and easy to just click download and save copy to drive 
len ratingfive Takes no time at all and it s saved to have forever 
len ratingfive Organizing files has always been a challenge for us before drive 
len ratingfive That lame computer desktop covered in files 
len ratingfive That was us before 
len ratingfive I like how I can color code the folders for drive 
len ratingfive This helps me a lot for organizing files 
len ratingfive It has a fun look and feel to it and Organizing files helps prevent buying uploading downloading repeat files 
len ratingfive Which saves money which is always nice 
len ratingfive I like to color code main folders and then have color coded sub folders inside those to further organize files so you have select main folders at a glance and then detailed inner folders to help when searching 
len ratingfive This took me a while to set up 
len ratingfive I m constantly telling my friends and family how to do it 
len ratingfive It s a ton of work to organize existing files this way because of the repeat typing for naming sub folders to go into main folders the first time 
len ratingfive Once you have the folders set up you can drag and drop folders to be created from your computer desktop 
len ratingfive For those doing this all manually I really suggest the drag and drop option from desktop 
len ratingfive The app will take you forever to create folders 
len ratingfive You will need to individually click each though to color code them 
len ratingfive That is something I wish drag and dropped and something I wish synced to computer desktop to match the drive color 
len ratingfive We ve went from a paper mail life to paperless and the folders are key when you start organizing thousands of files for different people in the same household for taxes hobby s milestones celebrations projects medical car pets school work etc 
len ratingfive I wish there was a way to have file type folders 
len ratingfive It would make sorting into folders that much more easier if it has writing on the actual folder itself searchable from the search bar by file type folder 
len ratingfive Maybe even have the option eventually to make your own folders with abbreviations for people hobbies etc 
len ratingfive would take organizing files to the next level 
len ratingfive I d like to see more options for the app that are already available on the desktop version 
len ratingfive Like downloading files that are shared with you 
len ratingfive The desktop version allows this the app does not 
len ratingfive I like to back up my files 
len ratingfive Especially shared ones 
len ratingfive It only takes someone tinkering with their folders to reorganize and it messes with folder permissions etc 
len ratingfive unnecessary drama I like to avoid by having my files backed up 
len ratingfive Would be really nice to have the download from phone feature 
len ratingfive Would also be nice to have more alerts to know when somebody adds a file to a shared folder to let you know what folder has the new file 
len ratingfive Right now it ll say which files recently opened etc but if more than were uploaded it doesn t say and it doesn t say where 
len ratingfive This feature would help when backing up files because I can just focus on backing up a few new files vs just backing up all files to flash drive to save time with the guessing since folders only say the date they were created when you sort newest to oldest 
len ratingfive  stars but I do think there s room for improvement 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Everybody should have it
len ratingfive So nice and easy make a banana split taste cheesy like my flo
len ratingfive One many outstanding google apps No more worries about losing files or backups Shared across all my devices
len ratingfive Hui
len ratingfive Best
len ratingfive It s cool app ever
len ratingfive Yay 
len ratingfive It processes CR files now 
len ratingfive I adore that functions 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive for work and personal use 
len ratingfive It seems to work better on my phone through the app then accessing from my laptop 
len ratingfive It s so convenient to quickly have files at my fingertips whenever I need them 
len ratingfive Quick user friendly so far no issues 
len ratingfour We use this app to store and share photos for our business 
len ratingfour It has worked perfectly for that application 
len ratingfour It would be even better if we could view notability notes in google drive 
len ratingfour Currently we have to download the note to notability which creates lots of extra copies and wastes time 
len ratingthree  G
len ratingfour Really useful and friendly
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive ever since it came out 
len ratingfive I really love Google Drive it s never failed me 
len ratingfive I love the fact that when somebody asked me for something that s on my computer are usually have it also saved to Google drive and I can go on any computer and retrieve it 
len ratingfive It s an awesome program thanks Google

len ratingfour Easy to use 
len ratingfive I use this app everywhere everyday

len ratingfive More dependable than my other clouds at saving changes 
len ratingfive This makes creating and getting to my files so easy and convenient 
len ratingfive I love having this app on my mobile devices 
len ratingfour I am grateful for this app to provide another wireless way to transfer documents photos and videos from my iPhone into my laptop 
len ratingfour I do wish they weren t removing the photos app in the computer version because that s storage I used to save photos 
len ratingfive Keeps my files organized and at my fingertips 
len ratingfive There are certain things I like to be able to access with my iPad Air when I am not near WiFi and Google Drive does the trick 
len ratingfive Of course I am a huge Google fan anyway which says a lot since I am seventy two years young 
len ratingfive Great products 
len ratingfive  I have so appreciated the use of Drive for personal and professional purposes 
len ratingfive I ve used it for school for general photo storage for saving of voicemails that I didn t want to take up space on my phone anymore 
len ratingfive It is really incredible how many features there are available here and it s complimentarily provided by Google 
len ratingfive Pretty cool 
len ratingthree I pay Mo for GB storage 
len ratingthree Overall the design is great and easy to use but it has a couple BIG flaws from my perspective 
len ratingthree  PDF files uploaded via the web interface over Firefox or IE sometimes get corrupted 
len ratingthree I ve reproduced and confirmed this with tech support 
len ratingthree  it has limitations sharing with non gmail users 
len ratingfive What a great app for storage man 
len ratingfive I use it all the time super easy to use on desktop and phone 
len ratingfive It s an integral part of my daily workflows 
len ratingfive  I really love this app as it helps me organize my files for school and personal use 
len ratingfive Thank you very much I am completely satisfied 
len ratingfive A suggestion that maybe you can connect this to school apps to save things on storage from courses 
len ratingfive I can easily updated all of my school works with this app 
len ratingfive My university uses Google Drive to do group works a lot so it s very convenient for me to use this app to check for updates and edit files 
len ratingfive I can also check several account at once 
len ratingfive Moreover it s very organize and has all of the features appear on the website 
len ratingtwo  Has trouble managing multiple accounts 
len ratingtwo Can t preview files that Safari can 
len ratingfive I always knew where to find my files music pictures and videos 
len ratingfive Plus it saves space on my iPhone
len ratingfive I love this app because I can easily access my folders when I need them and they are easy to find 
len ratingfive Storage place is good
len ratingfive This is good
len ratingfive Super
len ratingfive I have had experience with bad email apps but this one is the best so far so I rate 
len ratingfive Excelente programa
len ratingone Needs a better way of managing organizing files I m importing AS I IMPORT 
len ratingfive I can always access my files from anywhere 
len ratingfive Experience
len ratingfive I use this app at school and at home I love it
len ratingfive I love Google 
len ratingfive It s convenient for my school work and social life 
len ratingfive A very useful app to manage your drives on the go 
len ratingfour This is where I now store all of my files 
len ratingfour The cloud is difficult to use and access 
len ratingfive  Awesome for school and other things
len ratingfive Enjoy using Google Drive because it is user friendly mobile efficient and well designed 
len ratingfive Google applications are the best 
len ratingfive Just like on a computer
len ratingfive I use this all the time for collaboration 
len ratingfive We used to use Dropbox but files weren t populating to all users Google Drive does not have this problem 
len ratingfive Plus they offer more storage for free 
len ratingfour I love this app and use it for just about everything 
len ratingfour Just moved back to iOS from android though and really miss the ability to add a shortcut to the home screen for a particular or folder 
len ratingfour Seems like this would be possible even with the iOS limitations since you can have a shortcut to a website on your home screen 
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingfive It saves everything forever unless you choose otherwise 
len ratingfive Best thing I ve ever done on the internet 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Having access to everything on my phone 
len ratingone I am getting porn ads posted to my drive 
len ratingone I can t seem to block it 
len ratingone Besides being gross and annoying it makes me think my data and docs are not secure in Drive 
len ratingone I am dumping the app 
len ratingfive Greatest APP of ALL times
len ratingfour Great for most part 
len ratingfive Extremely reliable useful tool for work home 
len ratingfive Short sweet review 
len ratingfive Yes 
len ratingfive Works like the web thing
len ratingfive Use it all the time 
len ratingfive It works great for me and lets me see my docs and save to it with ease 
len ratingfive I m also able to link multiple gmail accounts 
len ratingfive Fast and convenient 
len ratingone Do not use this app if you plan on putting anything up on Google drive that is of a personal nature 
len ratingone Previously it was possible to use passcode lock on your iPhone or iPad to prevent any private documents from being immediately accessible by unlocking your device 
len ratingone They have disabled passcode lock and now anyone looking at your device for any reason can get to your documents if you have not signed out of Drive 
len ratingone Terrible idea 
len ratingone Is Google not aware that people driving often unlock their phones and hand them to a passenger to help with navigation 
len ratingone Having no security beyond my iPhone passkey is not adequate to protect my documents 
len ratingone BAD MOVE GOOGLE 
len ratingfive What else can I say 
len ratingfive It s the simplest online storage solution that does it all 
len ratingfour if you could just make it that while reading a pdf and clicking or slightly scrolling on the screen have the title of the pdf show up without automatically scrolling the pdf file this can be seen on desktop version but is annoying on ios
len ratingthree I wish my pictures could be sorted by date
len ratingfive Drive is the perfect file storage system whether it s for school or personal life Drive offers a sizable amount of free storage and an excellent live editing feature 
len ratingfive All it takes is a Google account which you probably already have and if not it s free and it s really easy to use 
len ratingthree  Why did Google remove the password lock feature 
len ratingthree Just because I want to let someone use my iPad doesn t mean I want them to get into my files 
len ratingthree When you upload files to Google Drive it puts in the name of the file the extension type which is confusing 
len ratingthree You get file names like me doc doc or you jpg jpg 
len ratingthree Does Google not know that a file extension type is not a file name 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive This is great for th grade hw 
len ratingfive I use this almost daily for school and inspirations and brainstormings
len ratingfive This is sooo good for helping me organize all my typing stuff into each class 
len ratingfive Love google drive 
len ratingfive It s easy to navigate and store important information 
len ratingfive  No doubt Google drive rocks my socks like Goldilocks 
len ratingfive Ya ll don t even know 
len ratingfive I can do all of my work on here and it keeps my stuff organized
len ratingfive Nothing more to say 
len ratingfive I won t use any other cloud storage except iCloud 
len ratingfour Aunque pocas veces presenta fallas de comunicaci n con la nube
len ratingtwo You guys can do better
len ratingfive I really find google drive useful 
len ratingfive Great for switching documents to other computers 
len ratingfive It is so awesome 
len ratingfive You can do sooooo much with this 
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive over years and really pleased with it 
len ratingtwo This app is so lame 
len ratingtwo It says I have like notifications and when I go on it it says no match found 
len ratingone It only allows for the person to see and not edit 
len ratingone If that was the case all we need is google slides or docs 
len ratingone What s the point of having drive if all we can do is see 
len ratingone I don t like it 
len ratingone I can t get my work done easily 
len ratingfive Best cloud drive out there 
len ratingfour I rated this out of stars because while it is nice that I can store and view my files anywhere the fact that you have to download OTHER apps in order to edit you files is quite annoying 
len ratingone Not user friendly 
len ratingfive Always good
len ratingfive Such an easy easy to store retrieve files 
len ratingfive This helps me save space on my devices so it s very convenient keep up the good work with this app thanks 
len ratingfive It s a winner
len ratingfive Easy to access and store images of family and friends 
len ratingfive Excellent tool for educators to use in class with students 
len ratingfive Much more user friendly and intuitive than I cloud which is a bit of a black hole in regards to access
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone One of the best feature of this app on the iPhone was the ability to password protect the app 
len ratingone Why on earth would you remove it 
len ratingfive Nice job google
len ratingfive Viry nic
len ratingfive  ios app 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingtwo It is difficult to find files with the search option most times i cannot find the file with the file name and index of all the file names such as pdf and worksheets or documents would be helpful when i am trying to find useful files needed 
len ratingtwo It seems to work great with photos using the photo app where the faces are matched and easy to find photos since they are all in a sort of catalogued but document files and pdfs as very difficult to find and hard to work with in google drive 
len ratingtwo It would be highly useful if there were more support 
len ratingfive I love this team but I wish AI would help me do scripts and complete tasks 
len ratingfive The support network seems a bit unstaffed 
len ratingfive To be clear I couldn t move my career in Chicago the way I do with google 
len ratingfive Much respect and love 
len ratingfive Congrats for changing my world 
len ratingfive Exelente 
len ratingfive Love being able to get my photos documents folders and programs anywhere I go on any device and then share them in any way I want to 
len ratingfive Only downside is difficulty printing as with all things Google 
len ratingfive Doing on line Speech Therapy I need a lot of materials at my fingertips and a spot to keep my billing ever changing class lists 
len ratingfive I can keep updated on Google Drive plus access everything from all my devices 
len ratingfive This is a lifesaver thank you 
len ratingfour Its good for viewing but often takes a minute or two to log me in 
len ratingfour I think it s because I have multiple emails but either way Google should be able to fix this 
len ratingfour The app is good for viewing not editing 
len ratingfive I use it almost every day
len ratingfive Google Drive helps with my School Stuff 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingfive So easy across all platforms 
len ratingfive Use it almost daily
len ratingone  Was not letting me switch accounts
len ratingfive So handy lets you access your files from any of you devices 
len ratingfive So easy to use keep my weddings pictures stored
len ratingfive The best I ve come across yet to store have accessibility to all types of documents 
len ratingfive I love to use google drive 
len ratingfive Easy and useful 
len ratingfive I feel myself comfortable and secure 
len ratingfive Because I know my google drive always with me

len ratingfive No need to say much 
len ratingfive It will be great to have more free storage to keep up with the new norm 
len ratingfive Excellent product 
len ratingfive I am a human
len ratingone Google Drive is confusing and unnecessarily complicated and nearly impossible to use 
len ratingone This is the biggest bunch of garbage I ve ever worked with 
len ratingone If you can find something else to use a recommend it 
len ratingfive I have to open this a many if times I had know idea you needed a certain search engine to do this 
len ratingfive Thanks for helping along the way

len ratingfive Very nice and reliable 
len ratingfive Good for writing papers on the go 
len ratingfive Using the google drive is the the way to share items with family and friends
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Very helpful and easy to use 
len ratingthree Can only open one folder at a time 
len ratingthree Can t see sub folders under a primary folder 
len ratingthree Dropbox can 
len ratingfour  It s good but you need google docs to edit a document
len ratingfive I m still learning how to use the different features but I love google docs 
len ratingfive Don t have to worry about the computer having a melt down and loosing my work 
len ratingfive Oh crap 
len ratingfive I forgot to save my work oh wait it does it automatically 
len ratingfive What 
len ratingfive I don t have to worry about a shared document and all of the participants having it opened and simultaneously make updates that s just awesomely efficient 
len ratingfive And just so much more 
len ratingfive I love u google docs
len ratingfive Simple seamless smart 
len ratingfive I am not a technically adroit person and I appreciate simple functionality 
len ratingfive Google Drive was easy to set up and works well on my Windows laptop and my ipad and my cellphone 
len ratingfive I like the capability of access to documents offline too 
len ratingfive Complete solution
len ratingone So when I downloaded the app I could not edit things and it was very difficult to find things and if the was a zero star i would choose that 
len ratingone I hope you will take my advice 
len ratingfive Awesome just awesome 
len ratingfive I believe everyone should have this app 
len ratingfour The application works great but their are minor issues I would prefer to have them fix the main is just adding documents into drive but that is just a minor nitpick 
len ratingfour This app is good but could be better for iPhone and iPad 
len ratingfour I wish editing documents was easier within the app 
len ratingfour I have students that use an iPad for documents and editing is just not user friendly like it is on a chrome book or laptop 
len ratingfour I like how when I add something to my drive on my computer seconds later I go to my phone it s there so that I don t have to download it on my computer 
len ratingfour  Great thing about drive is it likes to collect data periodically groups and organizes it and can be used as a path from one user name to another without freaking out apple iOS or windows 
len ratingfour Only problem I see is it s not always clear what account the data lands in and it collects just about everything even things you have no idea where they came from 
len ratingfour Hey if you like storing content images docs and webpages this is an easy solution 
len ratingfour I tend to use it more as an alternative pathway still uncertain how to index file and utilize the content that it holds 
len ratingfive Maravilloso
len ratingfive Works as needed 
len ratingfive Saving things for offline is great on the run 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive As someone who tends to keep a lot of stuff in cloud storage the ability to access and upload from my phone with an easy to use interface is great 
len ratingfive I love it I can access and share files from nearly any device 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfour Good but needs faster uploads 
len ratingfour I do a lot of video and sometimes if the file is more than gigs you are in for a wait 
len ratingfour But I really love all the cross platform compatibility with Apple windows or android 
len ratingfive Google has done it again 
len ratingfive All the documents and anything you can think of at your fingertips 
len ratingfive Love how it allows for all devices to work seamlessly 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I have what I need with this 
len ratingfive Good for me all the way 
len ratingone Copies everything 
len ratingone  Than making this app better 
len ratingone Google was once a place to find information 
len ratingone It had no bias 
len ratingone It was the modern day tool to educate yourself 
len ratingone Unfortunately Google has lost its way 
len ratingone Hiding factual information from users Turning up incorrect search Results that have nothing to do with what you re looking for 
len ratingone This is simply because google Will no longer share information it doesn t want you to know about 
len ratingone It s time for a change 
len ratingone Boycott google 
len ratingfive It s free and it works well 
len ratingone Google Docs don t open 
len ratingone Just spins indefinitely 
len ratingfour As I said on the title
len ratingfive What s not to like for the price it s a deal that s hard to beat 
len ratingfive I can t say anything that hasn t already been said about this wonderful app 
len ratingfive Best part is that I can offline files for quick access 
len ratingfive I wish I could just offline a subfolder instead of going into each folder selecting all the items and offline the selection 
len ratingfive I have used Drive for years 
len ratingfive It has been reliable and easy to use 
len ratingfive I am grateful to have it at my disposal 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfour  I occasionally have issues with google saving documents so I ve started taking screen shots so that I don t lose important or recently uploaded information 
len ratingfour  When doing homework and writing invoices 
len ratingfive I love that I can access my drive file on all my devices 
len ratingfive It makes things SO much easier
len ratingfive It is a very good google application
len ratingfive I love how helpful drive is even as a kid in Middle School it helps a lot when I can t use the computer 
len ratingfive Great for writing essays 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfive I pay mo 
len ratingfive for the extra storage so I can save years of pictures I just have not figured how to off load them onto a hard drive 
len ratingfive Gucci
len ratingfive Keeps all my info synced across platforms and devices 
len ratingfive Love Google Drive

len ratingfive I love using Google drive to keep track of my important information 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and convenient 
len ratingthree The app works wonderfully but when I tried to download a file on my computer it would only let me download from the email and not my personal 
len ratingfive I google drive it is amazing 
len ratingone Difficult to use 
len ratingone Just getting in is a problem 
len ratingfour it s pretty good
len ratingfive Gooooood
len ratingone What would be a great app is rendered useless because you must download a separate app in order to edit a single item in spreadsheets 
len ratingone Until they fix this ridiculous issue I cannot use this app 
len ratingfive Goog
len ratingfive I love drive

len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Eh
len ratingfive I m still learning how to use Dash but so far it is saving me time

len ratingfive But that will take time 
len ratingfive Amazing continuity real time updates across devices

len ratingfive  I have always loved google but honestly have had issues with accessing my original gmail account over the past years have made several gmails in attempts just trying to access my account 
len ratingfive So many pics memories that mean a lot to me 
len ratingfive  but I have faith with there Newer security measures 
len ratingfive Yay 
len ratingfive I think I can really reply back to gmail help center in my newest gmail finally get to access MINE back 
len ratingfive  im sure google will help me secure it up as well 
len ratingfive Then my goal is delete the several I had to create and make my life simpler and a lot more secure 
len ratingfive Ditched Dropbox for this but could you perhaps make this and your other apps pass off to your iOS Chrome browser instead of Safari 
len ratingfive I realize they re both the same rendering engine but it d make the whole experience a bit more Googly 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive  Great storage capability
len ratingfive I love it

len ratingfive I can use it to right anything for school or other things
len ratingtwo Its all set to a wall photos which is really annoying if I knew google photos would become useless later and this section would be so disorganized in would ve never put my photos in here
len ratingfive I have been using it for months now and all I can say is great 
len ratingfive google apps no need my words thanks for all of google apps
len ratingfive Easily accessed across different devices and operating systems 
len ratingone Drop Box was easy to set up access to my files from all devices and have my work and business DB easily accessed 
len ratingone Google Drive not so much 
len ratingone Wish Boss would go back to Drop Box 
len ratingthree A little clunky but accessibility to my files overrules 
len ratingthree Love Google yet many of their tools perform as if they re in beta and most could be more intuitive and user friendly 
len ratingthree Brainiac developers should stop overthinking 
len ratingthree Keep it simple guys

len ratingfive The only feature it lacks that would be great would be the ability to rename files when saving them via gmail 
len ratingfive If I were any happier with this app I would permanently be blessed with a smile that would light the world and bring about world peace once and for all 
len ratingfive Farting glitter and free to pursue a life of happiness and riches Alas I am not quite that happy 
len ratingfive Yet
len ratingthree I love Google Drive but the mobile app makes it really hard to navigate comments in Docs 
len ratingthree They re numbered like footnotes and visually corresponding them with the doc is cumbersome

len ratingfive I am not sure if it s encrypted because the password might not be enough protection 
len ratingfive Maybe it is 
len ratingfive Thanks to all who work at Google to make amazing things happen 
len ratingfive I really hope the rumors are not true 
len ratingfive Google please don t get rid of Drive
len ratingfive Easy to use and robust 
len ratingthree It s impossible to filter spam when people invite you to edit or review documents 
len ratingthree Here documents are nothing more than spam and you have to manually delete them

len ratingfive Excelente aplicaci n
len ratingone Really 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingthree If only Google would prioritize Drive and Docs to make the small but important changes I and many others have urged to create a truly effective and efficient filing and sharing system they could kill the competition while nurturing nascent but stunted cooperation and creativity in institutions and organizations 
len ratingthree Ah if only 
len ratingfour I want to select multiple documents to move from one folder to another 
len ratingfour Is there way to do this 
len ratingfour I use it all the time 
len ratingfour Love it 
len ratingthree I do not like the quick access 
len ratingthree The space usage is not updated as needed when I go to remove files and more 
len ratingfive I really enjoyed using this app I use it whenever I want to look at my photos
len ratingfive Best thing for iPhone users ever love it 
len ratingfour Great app for storage 
len ratingfour The free storage is too short 
len ratingfour Should be GB 
len ratingfive Google drive is the best 
len ratingfive Se ve que trabajan con empe o para sus usuarios gracias 
len ratingfive I like it
len ratingfive Convenient and easy to use on my IPhone and IPad 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Google Drive is the best program I use to keep passwords paperwork important photos and other info 
len ratingfive This program is a must have program 
len ratingfive Google drive is by far the best cloud service around
len ratingfive All app of google is perfect
len ratingthree  I have been using google drive since years 
len ratingthree But latest update has removed a passcode lock for google drive 
len ratingthree  google may i ask the need to remove passcode lock 
len ratingthree This is one more layer of security to all my data before i hand over my phone to someone 
len ratingthree Having iphone unlocked is also unlocking your all data store in google drive 
len ratingthree  developers please bring this feature back and i promise stars are guaranteed from my side 
len ratingfive I see so many recipes on Facebook and I can copy and paste them to Google Docs 
len ratingfive I have folders setup for example breakfast casseroles chicken Mexican pasta desserts etc I can put the same recipe in more than one folder 
len ratingfive If I want a recipe I can search on an ingredient and easily find it 
len ratingfive I love the whole Google package 
len ratingfive Staunch supporter and user of all services offered by Google 
len ratingfive Google Drive is just one of those convenient secure services that fits my needs perfectly 
len ratingfive Conveniently accessible from anywhere and all my devices 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Wonderful app 
len ratingfive Very quick updates from one device to another 
len ratingfive Can count on knowing your files are there and are able to find them 
len ratingfive Microsoft One Drive is great when it works right 
len ratingfive But too often I find it confusing and I cannot figure out where a file is or I get confusing messages 
len ratingfive A must for productivity
len ratingfive Very helpful to itfor organized photos
len ratingfour The app is really good but anything bigger than two pages takes forever to load no matter what device you have 
len ratingfour I really like the app for the easy access off all my docs and the ability to export them to different programs 
len ratingfive Works so well between multiple devices 
len ratingfive I put in all my work in one place without worrying about it 
len ratingfive I had to share almost photos with a client and it was so simple with google drive 
len ratingfive And my client was able to download all the photos at once which other applications rarely offer
len ratingtwo I love using google drive I just think it s ridiculous that you need separate apps to edit documents 
len ratingtwo The app is ok but missing a major feature 
len ratingtwo There is no option to set folders for offline viewing 
len ratingtwo Google expects you to select each individual file and set it to be available offline 
len ratingtwo That makes no sense 
len ratingtwo If you plan on seriously using google drive and need your files off line look elsewhere 
len ratingfive Th
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive Never had any trouble before 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive for over years 
len ratingfive I started using it my first year of college and have continued since 
len ratingfive Google Drive is convenient easy to use and powerfully connected with your gmail account and the entire google ecosystem 
len ratingfive I haven t used the Microsoft Suite of tools since Drive 
len ratingfive Why would you when Drive is free and available on ANY computer on any operating system that can access the internet via a web browser 
len ratingfive This mobile app works great for accessing reading your content everywhere 
len ratingfive It used to be that you could edit your docs spreadsheets slides in this app but Google has extracted editing functionality into their own apps Google docs spreadsheets slides but with good reason 
len ratingfive That s not a big deal though since those individual apps are highly optimized for their specific need 
len ratingfive Jdjddke

len ratingfour It allows me to work on projects from anywhere I have an internet connection and provides ample storage and auto save features 
len ratingfour It was a life saver in graduate school particularly when it came to group work 
len ratingfour I give the app stars because it differentiates drive docs and slides into connected but distinct apps 
len ratingfour I don t love the set up as much as on a web browser going back and forth to look at multiple documents is not as seamless or efficient 
len ratingfour I wish it operated more like it does online but it gets the job done when I m traveling with my iPad 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Great product only thing I wish is that it would show me a Raw file
len ratingfive Stores hi quality photos and hi res music remarkably well

len ratingone It till me that I don t have permission to open files 
len ratingfive The minimal design leaves little distractions and makes all of your files stay organized and very easy to find

len ratingone How do I stop this 
len ratingfive I love the ease of use and compatibility with all of my devices that Google offers 
len ratingfive The amount of storage for free is fair to consumers which is also very appreciated

len ratingfive I rise from my desk chair and begin the daily commute home 
len ratingfive In the bus using my Bluetooth wireless headset and my smartphone I listen to some music from Google Play while opening said document which I previously saved to Google Drive and continue my work not wasting precious time 
len ratingfive When I get home after unplugging myself from the headset I am greeted by my loved ones 
len ratingfive After some quality time I decide to lie in bed 
len ratingfive I reach for my tablet stored in the drawer of the bedside table 
len ratingfive Once again Google Drive fulfills its promise and effortlessly I open the document proof reading it to correct and polish it 
len ratingfive When I want I can leave it so tomorrow I begin the process again 
len ratingfive Simple and convenient are the qualities that come to my mind when I think of Google Drive

len ratingfive Well done Google 
len ratingtwo I don t know why you removed this feature it was very useful 
len ratingtwo I know for sure someone opens my phone he still will need a passcode to access my driver 
len ratingtwo Removing it was a huge mistake 
len ratingfour Google drive is a very easy and efficient app for me 
len ratingfour I store all my important documents and pics and get to access them across any platform 
len ratingfive  By far the most functional of all cloud storage apps 
len ratingfive I particularly enjoy the ease with which I can customize sharing settings and adding the link to clipboard immediately after sharing is a nice touch 
len ratingfive After many years of automatically saving my best and most important images to my Google Drive I don t worry about losing any of my artwork from crashes or to any unforeseen problems 
len ratingfive I can trust my best artwork to safekeeping with Google Drive and have for many years 
len ratingfive The Best Place for your Best Images 
len ratingfive Helpfull program
len ratingfour Of course it s a decent app it s google 
len ratingfour I could only say that I wouldn t mind if it were a little easier to organize 
len ratingfour Their fault for making google photos so easy that I compare any document photo app to it 
len ratingfour But good job ppl

len ratingone Just as bad if you tried to delete something 
len ratingone Very on friendly 
len ratingfive So like totally awesome app and it s completely free dude

len ratingfive Been using this for years and I don t plan on switching to another cloud based file system 
len ratingfour Nice app
len ratingfive Excelente 
len ratingfive Completo facil navegacao 
len ratingfour Fast easy what else is there to say 
len ratingfive This app allows you to access any pic or video from anywhere no matter how big the file 
len ratingfive Always able to show family and friends the latest development 
len ratingfive Use drive mostly to access files shared with me I have a private cloud server for my own files 
len ratingfive It does what you d expect it to 
len ratingone  Won t allow me to play my audio books that I have in my google drive
len ratingone I like Drive but it prompts me for a review every time I tap anything 
len ratingone So here you go star 
len ratingfive Love Google Drive 
len ratingfive Makes the practice of law move faster and more smoothly in connection with my Chrome Book and cloud based paperless law practice
len ratingfive Great to have docs my fingertips 
len ratingfive My things are always here as I left them
len ratingfive Fantastic
len ratingfive Actually the future is present with GoogleDrive 
len ratingfive The none pushy approach allows to want to know more about it and find more ways to take advantage of it 
len ratingfive As of now the barriers between my devices have come down I can collaborate with myself 
len ratingfive Now I have to learn to collaborate and share with others 
len ratingfive It will be awesome 
len ratingfive Ifs Pabst
len ratingfour I only wish it was easier to ad notes and highlight PDFs without downloading it to my computer and reopening in adobe or other app 
len ratingfive Has never failed me 
len ratingfive Works great and I use it ALL the time 
len ratingone Google Help was no help 
len ratingfive I used to use it
len ratingfive I m glad it s stayed relatively simple yet work
len ratingfour I love using Drive on my computer 
len ratingfour It s a little clunky on the phone but it s nice being able to take all my documents with me wherever I may be 
len ratingfive This App is possibly the easiest conveniently designed in which most Photos Videos are immediately uploaded towards any app offering so 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive good 
len ratingfive Works easily between iPad and Android 
len ratingfive Being a musician with an iPhone it s really tough to send quality wav recordings via email 
len ratingfive However with Drive it s easily possible 
len ratingfive Don t know what I used to do without this 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive I find cloud storage orgs that collect every scrap of your personal data to be a bit creepy but I guess it is the way of things 
len ratingfive I love drive 
len ratingfive It is free at the low end and quite capable 
len ratingfive That said loading a word doc into drive editing especially but not only with track changes so someone else can accept each edit individually turned on and handing back to ms word is improving but still not quite there yet 
len ratingfive I blame protectionist monopolist Microsoft but still it is for now the standard which all must work around with 
len ratingthree And no Touch ID or other solution available 
len ratingfive Marvelous storage device for photos files and videos 
len ratingfive I always know where my materials are located in Drive 
len ratingfive Google drive is easy to use and has great storage 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive This has saved me time and time again 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Yeah everything they make is awesome what else can you say 
len ratingfive Google is very Kool Beans
len ratingfive This app helps me keep my school work in files it helps keep me organized and it is convenient for me to know what project is which 
len ratingone I like google drive 
len ratingone I use it a lot 
len ratingone But the mobile version does not please me 
len ratingone I like the setup of the drive app and the organization but i don t like that you have to download the other apps just to edit your documents slideshows and spreadsheets 
len ratingone it feels inefficient and scattered 
len ratingone it s a waste of space on my phone 
len ratingone the google drive app is nothing more than a glorified window look but not touch etc etc 
len ratingone and the individual apps docs etc are more difficult and painful to navigate than necessary 
len ratingone even when i click through my various folders and get to a document once i exit out of that document i still have to go through all of the folders again to find another doc in the same folder 
len ratingone please merge your apps 
len ratingone like i said i like the organization of google drive but i feel that the entire system would be much more efficient and effective if everything could truly be accessed from one place 
len ratingone thank you 
len ratingfive Very nice
len ratingfive Great storage and easy to access files 
len ratingfour  pdf s sometimes don t properly load 
len ratingfour Easy to organize easy to access
len ratingfive Nobody can beat the ease of use and speed which this works 
len ratingfive It just plain works every time perfectly 
len ratingfive I have saved hundreds of documents on the fly on my phone to easily access later on my PC or iPad 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingthree I just used this app to view a Doc and the number of times the title overlay appeared on my screen from purely casual scrolling is atrocious and annoying 
len ratingthree Google Team I expect your products to be well designed ergonomically and experientially for your users with the rep you ve earned 
len ratingthree But this is a pretty basic issue 
len ratingtwo I Had The Hardest Time Sharing it Should Be Easier To Share Videos 
len ratingfive What a world we live in 
len ratingfive Start a Document Sheet or Slides 
len ratingfive Add edit or begin stored information on the run 
len ratingfive Be up to date as the info comes to you 
len ratingfive Pay a co pay at the doctor enter the date and amount while you are waiting 
len ratingfive Done 
len ratingfive Get a new prescription update your daily meds while the label is in your hand 
len ratingfive Done 
len ratingone Removing the passcode is a deal breaker 
len ratingone Listen I have two issues I let my child play with my phone and I have VERY important files 
len ratingone Google you re just not getting that this a possible scenario 
len ratingone Dropbox and OneDrive have passcode 
len ratingone And that s me leaving for the competition 
len ratingfive I use this every day to store all my photos and transfer them between my devices and my family makes my life easier lol
len ratingfive Recipe book on the go 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive I can keep all kinds of crap in here and access it from any of my current devices 
len ratingfive G drive is the best
len ratingfive Been using this for years 
len ratingfive Helps keep us organized yr after yr 
len ratingfive Even if when my computer crashes lol 
len ratingone  In the App Store settings I ve disabled allowing apps to ask me for reviews and ratings in app 
len ratingone Google like some other apps decided that this is unacceptable and built their own in app nagging for a rating which circumvents this setting 
len ratingone One star for treating a customer like a means to an end 
len ratingfive Like that
len ratingfour It s great to be able to store my data securely and to retrieve it if I accidentally delete it from my phone 
len ratingthree Any pdf that I can edit on my PC or Mac shows up blank in this app 
len ratingthree It is useful for pictures and word documents 
len ratingfive Google Drive is awesome 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and to share items 
len ratingfive Google is always adding functionality to google drive 
len ratingfive I find it way better then the other cloud drives 
len ratingfive I simply love it 
len ratingfive J
len ratingfive It s clutch
len ratingone I m trying to like Google Drive but I upload a video not over the top but then a few days later it isn t easily available 
len ratingone I m very frustrated

len ratingfive dope

len ratingfive Google drive really supports my on the go lifestyle with access to files anywhere my phone works plus I can use any computer 
len ratingfive Everything anywhere 
len ratingfive Drive is awesome 
len ratingfive It does what it should perfectly 
len ratingfive Drive ties in nicely in iOS and on my guest 
len ratingfive I use it for photography and video work 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfour Why do you need to download the app for each individual functionality of Google Drive documents presentations spreadsheets 
len ratingfour All of these functionalities should be offered in one cohesive Google Drive app 
len ratingfive I don t have any complaints 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive great backup storage for important doc
len ratingone Maybe just link them into Chrome 
len ratingfive The drive comes in handy with emails attachments and exporting raw video files from my phone 
len ratingfive I wish it had a one time payment permanent online storage option so I could backup import pictures and videos that I want to save for future generations 
len ratingone Every time a select save to camera roll it doesn t 
len ratingone And I have to go through a tedious process through the desktop website in order to do so 
len ratingone Incredibly annoying 
len ratingfive Keeps important information in one place
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive  I love my google drive 
len ratingfive I use it all n my consulting work and teaching 
len ratingfive No matter where I am I can share edit and create files 
len ratingfive Now I don t have to carry multiple flash drives 
len ratingfive Ty tyfn
len ratingfive The worlds most use ful app
len ratingfive I love Google drive 
len ratingfive It is easy to use and no matter what I always have my files no need to carry a usb drive anymore 
len ratingfive Use it for all of my files recommend it to all of my clients 
len ratingfive Truly the best flexible platform ever 
len ratingfive I can access my data ANYWHERE 
len ratingfive I never have any technical glitches or anything 
len ratingfive Smooth process every time but what else was I to expect from Google 
len ratingfive Well nothing but the very best that is 
len ratingfive I m a photographer and Google drive really helps me organize my pictures and get to my pictures in a quick efficient way to show my clients 
len ratingfive A must have app
len ratingfive My digital room of requirement 
len ratingone Can t open zip file on iPhone using google cloud 
len ratingfive If this could be better it would make me nachos 
len ratingfive Thanks for making this app I freaking love it 
len ratingtwo Poor UI 
len ratingtwo App should recall where you left off in video 
len ratingtwo Requires or clicks just to get back in to video not to mention trying to get back in to video where you left off 
len ratingtwo No rewind or fast forward or sec just scrubbing 
len ratingone Stop asking me to rate you
len ratingfive I use dropbox for my critical documents business and personal for eyes only viewing but for non critical docs pictures drive is a welcome addition to the free cloud based archiving universe 
len ratingone Not intuitive 
len ratingone having difficulty making this work
len ratingthree return password for app
len ratingfive I really didn t notice how much I have been relying on Google Drive until I noticed over a decade of files 
len ratingfive My stuff has survived several iterations of Google Drive 
len ratingfive Some photos I thought would be lost when my computer was about to crash were backed up to an external hard drive twice SEAGATE and both of those TB and GB external HDs are none responsive today 
len ratingfive My photos may as well have been lost 
len ratingfive What saved me 
len ratingfive My trusty Google Drive which I used to blow off as wait and see Well it s been years and now I can say I swear by it 
len ratingfive I realize the NSA probably has access to everything on Google and I m not happy about that 
len ratingfive However I feel extremely confident that I have nothing to hide and I m even more confident that my files won t be lost 
len ratingfive But NSA really it s like someone looking underneath your skirt without you knowing when and if it has happened already but all you can count on is your underwear is clean 
len ratingfive It s really creepy 
len ratingfive PS I backup my files with Carbonite now 
len ratingfive I m done wasting money on another Seagate HD 
len ratingfive I pay a month to Google for increased storage and it has been well worth the subscription 
len ratingfive Bye bye unreliable external hard drives 
len ratingone The first pop up blocked my view of the folder I was naming 
len ratingone I just must be too old for this 
len ratingone I m sure I m alone in this but I find Drive to be not intuitive and too clever for its own good 
len ratingone I can never easily find the file I am looking for or print or delete without going to the wrong place 
len ratingfive Works well on mobile tablet and desktop 
len ratingfive Huge is the fact that you can now easily switch between multiple google accounts if you have separate gmail for work personal etc 
len ratingone Doesn t do the one thing I need it to do 
len ratingfive itslitpham
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Es buena seria mejor si se integrara como Dropbox en las p ginas y todo lo posible 
len ratingfive nice
len ratingfive This is the most unhelpful review ever 
len ratingfive Make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel 
len ratingfive Free gift cards
len ratingthree Gets job done if it s basic editing but hard to organize when you get many files 
len ratingfive I use this app not only to store pictures videos and documents 
len ratingfive You can also download it on to a Windows computer to transfer your photos videos and documents 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingone Its quite inefficient
len ratingfive Works like a charm 
len ratingfive Works fabulous and very reliable 
len ratingfive A great vehicle for saving critical information that needs to be accessed at anytime from any computer 
len ratingfive Of course it is an internet based entity so it s probably susceptible to hacking just as everything else however if you have vital info that needs to be stored and you don t want to keep it on your phone or carry around a computer with you this is you answer 
len ratingfive Between work and my personal life Google Drive helps me keep everything in sync 
len ratingone  I need the other apps to do the other things I can t do anything 
len ratingfive So convenient 
len ratingfive Quick and easy but so effective 
len ratingfive It keeps my flies save and sound
len ratingfive Free no subscription Easy couldn t be more easy Not only does it connect my devices it also connects jobs and customers even friends and family 
len ratingfive MUST HAVE AP 
len ratingfive Love this
len ratingfive It s very helpful 
len ratingfive Love the drive love google love it all
len ratingfive Absolutely GORGEOUS remodel and a magnificent view on a bluff with a view of Saddleback Mountain

len ratingfive What great free apps to store and organize photos and videos it s a share just certain folders will the people keep all the folders private for yourself Google Drive really works great highly recommend it 
len ratingfive I had the unfortunate task to close an estate and the ability have data at my finger tips regardless of platform was in valuable 
len ratingfive Google drive is the best and totally contorlable manageable and accessable cross platfoy 
len ratingfour Love it 
len ratingfour Takes up a lot of storage though 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Helps me keep what I choose all in one place

len ratingfive iCloud only gives you GB free 
len ratingfive But need pdf Support 
len ratingfive So needless to say this is a life saver 
len ratingfive Your surely impressive keep enjoying life and go where the drum beat takes you 
len ratingfive Drive just works 
len ratingfive That s it 
len ratingfive No drama 
len ratingtwo I used G suite for a year mostly for email hosting 
len ratingtwo I returned elsewhere for my email at the end of the year but no longer have control of my account as it is managed 
len ratingtwo All I want is my account back 
len ratingfour But would benefit from more visual perspicuity 
len ratingfour Also it s kind of annoying opening up a document and being sent to another app to edit it 
len ratingfive Just had my Readers Theatre group build a slideshow to use as backgrounds for their performance tomorrow in class 
len ratingfive Genius 
len ratingfive And of course they shared with me and I can project for the whole class 
len ratingfive We love Google 
len ratingfive Google Drive baynor ena folder baynor min yiweten nebere 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive I m part of a team at University of Utah that runs a health care online community 
len ratingfive We would not be able to manage it without Drive 
len ratingfive All files are shared often in real time 
len ratingfive Podcast interviews immediately uploaded from our iPhones making transition transcription service seamless 
len ratingfive The expanded storage for super cheap is a must for academic work no budget 
len ratingfive Drive is our communication and file sharing hub 
len ratingfive Can t say enough wonderful things about it 
len ratingtwo You must get more apps although this is the base you are not able to write without another app
len ratingfive I ve been using it for a long time 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Drive works in conjunction with the Docs Sheets and other Google Suite Apps smoothly and intuitively 
len ratingfive I can easily copy files from my work network and access on any device i have internet access using just one google account 
len ratingfive I would suggest using it across iPhone desktop 
len ratingfive I have found it to be invaluable 
len ratingfive It s my digital memory for personal and for work 
len ratingone  stars for you 
len ratingone Regardless of whoever whatever the impetus was for disabling in app security kindly reactivate it 
len ratingone Controlling access from within your suite of apps is vital many users rely on it 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive Can t fathom a more convenient way to carry files and photos with me and share across multiple devices 
len ratingfive And knowing it s backed by google you know you re getting a quality product 
len ratingfive Easy to use across my iPhone MacBook and PC 
len ratingfive Constantly saving so you never have to worry about losing your work 
len ratingfive Can t beat when it comes to cloud storage easy to navigate and easy to use 
len ratingfive You are the best people to make this happen
len ratingfive Very easy to create documents and I love that I have access to my documents anywhere I happen to be 
len ratingtwo  I am not able to edit worksheets without doing multiple steps 
len ratingthree Works but is not as intuitive as Apple Pages 
len ratingfive Great for travel 
len ratingone ok
len ratingfive This makes my life so much easier on the go 
len ratingfive I don t know what I would do without it 
len ratingfive Love everything about it 
len ratingfive Awesome for people like me 
len ratingfive Super simple to use and just enough value 
len ratingfive This is the way software should be 
len ratingfive  I no longer save piles of paper receipts archive all my photos videos and helps me share stuff with my family 
len ratingfive Google definitely nailed with this app 
len ratingfive Works great and it s easy to use and print from it 
len ratingone One star just want to draw attention
len ratingfive Google Drive is a wonderful source to have information readily stored and available 
len ratingfive Wherever I am and whether device I use my information can be retrieved 
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingfive Never lose any 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Pictures are not put into order of date taken or order of upload 
len ratingone There is not an option to put pictures in any chronological order 
len ratingone I Worked all day to move my iPad pictures of classes that I had taught only to realize that they were put into a jumbled mess 
len ratingone Very frustrating to realize that I had deleted them as I went and there was no going back to retrieve my dates and the order that I had before I called google drive phone number and they were no help 
len ratingone Said that this program has no order options with iPad and I could call Apple and see if they can help 
len ratingone  so I called Apple and they said that they couldn t help and I should call google drive 
len ratingone Haha 
len ratingone this might be funny if it wasn t so terribly frustrating 
len ratingone Only use this app if you want your pictures put into a jumbled mess 
len ratingfive The only cloud app I use 
len ratingfive Fast compatible with any operating system and works like a dream 
len ratingone Although Google Drive works perfectly fine on my PC I seem to have a lot of trouble with the app 
len ratingone I have Google Drive for personal and professional use 
len ratingone I have never had an issue for personal use although my professional documents never seem to be accurate through the app 
len ratingone I have a shared Excel spreadsheet that I have access to via Google Drive 
len ratingone The spreadsheet is always correct with accurate scheduling information on a PC yet on the app I have to search through a few different weeks of documents to find the current week s document that I am looking for 
len ratingone To be more specific if I am looking for an Excel spreadsheet of a work schedule for the week of Dec and I open that document on the app it will automatically pull up one of the previous week s Excel schedules 
len ratingone To find the current week s schedule I have to look back on one of the previous week s schedules and it will show the current week s scheduling information 
len ratingone It is super inconvenient and frustrating to have to go on an Easter egg hunt to try and find the information I need 
len ratingone I don t know if it is an app error a Google Drive error an Excel error an iPhone error or a user error 
len ratingone I pride myself in being a competent person and I have no issues using drive on a PC so I can t understand what would be so different about the app 
len ratingone I have updated it every time there has been an update I have deleted the app and reinstalled it and my phone is also updated regularly 
len ratingone My colleagues have the app on their iPhones and don t seem to have the same problem which leaves me confused 
len ratingone Aside from personal use this app is completely useless to me on my phone 
len ratingone What is supposed to be a convenient and easy to use app has become nothing more than a headache and wasted time 
len ratingfive I ve had to go on it to do homework and other stuff my teacher makes us do essays And it is the best way to keep your work
len ratingtwo Only a few of my photos will upload to google drive 
len ratingtwo Is there a reason for this 
len ratingfive This is literally my life now 
len ratingfive I use it for everything it s amazing 
len ratingfour Great for syncing pics across my devices without having to email them to myself Also nice for sharing files at work with my team 
len ratingfour I like the fact that I can update edit weekly time sheets in my google drive and our accountant can see the changes in real time from the shared file which helps her run payroll smoothly My only caveat is that I noticed when I tried to share pics from my saved pics in my iPhone to google drive there wasn t an option for google drive 
len ratingfour I had to go to my google drive first and click the button to upload them this way 
len ratingfour No biggie but my android phones don t have this issue 
len ratingfour I can upload photos to google drive from my photo albums first or my google drive app first with android I just happened to like sharing pics right from my photo albums to google drive bc of the lay out and ease of choosing all the pics I want to sync at same time across my devices 
len ratingfour Also sometimes when editing in google docs on a shared file editing within charts gets doesn t work as efficiently as it does in ms word 
len ratingfour So then I have to insert data one cell at a time instead of inserting the the whole column Overall stars Great app 
len ratingfive Best application you can have on your phone for business personal life and pretty much anything you need 
len ratingfive Thanks google
len ratingfive This app is so cool it helps me with my school work

len ratingone I m supposed to share a document with a teacher to turn it in and it s late because of all the stupid crap these apps want 
len ratingone I tried to open google drive in safari and it told me to download the app 
len ratingone I downloaded the app pulled up my document which was a slideshow 
len ratingone I tapped edit and it made me open it in safari making the entire download relatively pointless 
len ratingone Then when I hit the edit button It said edit in the slides app and asked me to download that 
len ratingone Why can t I edit it IN DRIVE 
len ratingone I download this app and it s pointless you want me to download more of your apps 
len ratingone They re all so damned specific docs only works with docs slides for slides drive doesn t work with anything 
len ratingone Why can t I just use drive from safari

len ratingtwo Yeah you can make them available offline but I don t want to have to go into another app just to view certain images and videos 
len ratingtwo Not cool Google not cool

len ratingfive Excellent data storage highly convenient 
len ratingfive I love this storage app but to keep it private wish the changes would have never taken place

len ratingfive Google Drive has transformed the way I work in a way no other program or product ever has 
len ratingfive It s sooooooooooooooooooooo usefully I can not empathize enough 
len ratingfive Love this 
len ratingfour This cloud storage thing is tricky 
len ratingfour First they all want you to trust them with your videos and pics and then they start changing the rules 
len ratingfour We ll see 
len ratingfive Every day using it more and more 
len ratingfour This app is good for storing documents that I 
len ratingfour Might need later 
len ratingfive Considering i do EVERYTHING on my phone google drive makes it easy to pull up any doc file or image up from any device 
len ratingfive All i do is log in 
len ratingfive Super easy to use I ve been recommending it ever since to anyone who s low on Storage 
len ratingfive This is the way to go 
len ratingone  Security took a big hit when Google removed the ability to protect access to your files using any kind of password or Touch ID access 
len ratingone The handaxe was also an angry man but a little boy had to put up with him
len ratingfive Works great on all my platforms 
len ratingfive awesome
len ratingfive  I love Google Drive for its efficiency and the great sharing capabilities 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Wish it will upload download faster Keep improving it
len ratingfive Incredibly useful to have on hand for all situations
len ratingfive Got it to download books and I couldn t be happier
len ratingfive The best in the whole world 
len ratingfive This app saved my sanity at times of all time high productivity or just straight procrastination 
len ratingfive Highly recommend for anyone who is very mobile or can take their tasks on the go 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive I use it at home at work and everywhere else there is an internet connection 
len ratingfive As a teacher the ability to share directories for submissions or posting of assignments is a game changer 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive able to share stuff between home work iphone conveniently 
len ratingfive very handy 
len ratingfive Necessary for being a person in 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Very helpful to have on my phone 
len ratingfour Useful to share docs real time hard to navigate and find anything as so unlike Windows in that 
len ratingfour Also almost impossible to put a link for one document into another
len ratingfive I use Google drive for school and it works amazingly 
len ratingfive Everything is very well integrated 
len ratingfive This app is wonderful I ve been using it for a few years now 
len ratingfive Will continue because it s a fantastic app to save photos n videos
len ratingfive Super easy to move files around and share them as needed
len ratingfive Maybe the most helpful app for a gb ios user 
len ratingfive You made a truly useful app for managing my google drive on the go 
len ratingfive Good job 
len ratingtwo I don t understand why passcode protection you guys removed from this app 
len ratingtwo I use my drive to keep personal photos obviously and my phone will not always be on my hand so I recommend to bring this protection again Otherwise i give stars
len ratingfive Very Good Way To Save Good Memories 
len ratingfour Very convenient and accessible 
len ratingfour Vital for teachers and writers 
len ratingfour Would benefit from having the ability to open more types of files especially rtf 
len ratingfive  This is a very handy utility Having the power to write endlessly offline across devices that is my reason for enjoying this app 
len ratingfive It has many other features of an office app and storing documents and photos 
len ratingfive All the power of dropbox and the power to manipulate items without need for another app 
len ratingfive It is nice to embrace the utility that should have been on iPhone from the start 
len ratingfive Now you can make to do lists across devices without needing apps 
len ratingfive Really this app is very powerful considering how limiting the device has been for years 
len ratingfive Simple necessary features have LONG been missing 
len ratingfive Especially in the photo department 
len ratingfive Drive is compensating for the lack of attention in these vital areas 
len ratingfive The iPhone is about a lot more than Facebook and it s very unfortunate that it now apparently incorporates that focus above intuitive utility having a powerful device in the hand now used for wanton apps like Facebook
len ratingfive It s really unbelievable that Google came up with something so great 
len ratingfive So Easy to use and versatile I use it all the time I bought a extra large Flash drive to back it up onto 
len ratingfive Thank You Google 
len ratingfive I am able to access all of my docs from one location 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive MAny thanks you are always uploading my latest docs 
len ratingfive I admire you and keep up thus good work
len ratingfive Absolutely love this 
len ratingthree Can t believe such basic function unavailable on google drive 
len ratingfour Drive works great as the main app to house the files but there are a few changes that would make Drive amazing 
len ratingfour Drive should function like an all inclusive program rather than a hub to connect to the separate programs 
len ratingfour EX If I open a Google doc file I should have the option to access the full Google doc tools STOP MAKING NEW TABS AND SENDING ME TO GOOGLE DOCS EVERYTIME 
len ratingfour The Drive Landing page should be customizable so you can see your docs slides and excel knock off 
len ratingfour This will prob need Java but it be worth it 
len ratingfour There needs to be quick access between accounts or a way you can make something available on both accounts that is more intuitive than downloading and re uploading 
len ratingfour If drive gives more functionality and essentially replaces the need for individual apps and programs then it will be a great all in one otherwise it would be easier to scale back drive and just make it a simpleclean hub where you click on the file and it opens the doc or presentation in an edit mode 
len ratingfour Like an online hard drive 
len ratingfour Otherwise Drive is just straddling the fence between unnecessary and redundant 
len ratingone Everything was working fine until I tried to log in on a different computer 
len ratingone The verification process ended up locking my stuff and forced me to change passwords 
len ratingone Now all my stuff is gone 
len ratingone Way too much hassle 
len ratingfive I can access all of my work easily
len ratingfive I think google drive is a great app since you can reach it everywhere I think it s great especially for school 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a wonderful way to coordinate events with a group and get immediate feedback to build the best plan for vacations and trips 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive every time I plan a family vacation 
len ratingfive It quickly and easily helps me plan events meal plans flights and sleeping arrangements 
len ratingfive Thanks for this awesome tool
len ratingfive This is a awesomazingly awesome app 
len ratingfive It s my cookbook on the counter for my recipes 
len ratingfive I use it to look up a recipe in the store when I see something on sale I look up a recipe to see much I need and to make sure if I buy the brisket etc I can make sure I have other ingredients 
len ratingfive I travel with an iPhone iPad and I have access to all of my files 
len ratingfive I store nothing on individual devices 
len ratingfive I just recently uploaded a raw qt movie on to google drive and the web playback is impeccable 
len ratingfive They finally figured out high res video sharing 
len ratingfive Very easy and painless
len ratingfive I use this all the time 
len ratingfive Don t store your presentations on Microsoft stuff this IS the stuff 
len ratingfive Awesome app
len ratingthree I consistently have problems downloading my stored videos to my mobile devices 
len ratingthree Very frustrating 
len ratingthree What s the point of having the drive 
len ratingfive I really appreciate having access across platforms when I m sharing files that are important to my projects

len ratingfive The best app 
len ratingone And in a few seconds could email a document pdf word etc from my iPhone to anyone 
len ratingone Can t now 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone I have No idea why 
len ratingone I m using the same phone 
len ratingone Apparently Google updated the app 
len ratingone DRIVE prevents deletion of files I want to delete 
len ratingfive Honestly I m not too big of a google fan but google drive really is impressive 
len ratingfive I ve recommended it to all my friends 
len ratingfive The pricing is great because you get GB free and then you can purchase more only a month for GB of storage 
len ratingfive As a college student this is great so if I forget my computer at home I can just pull it up on my phone 
len ratingfive And I can store all my worksheets and power points and word documents on it 
len ratingfive And I can create organizing folders to put all my documents in 
len ratingfive I ve already purchased the TB plan because I share my account with two other students and we are filling up the storage up fast 
len ratingfive Great job google 
len ratingfive Google docs is convenient and easy to share documents without a great deal of work 
len ratingfive You can share documentation and place restrictions and unshare if you are the owner 
len ratingfive I can access it on my phone iPad and desktop all at the same time which is great for multi tasking especially while I have group projects 
len ratingfive When sharing you can see in real time everyone working on the project 
len ratingfive I absolutely love it 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Good solid app which works the way it should 
len ratingfive Great execution people 
len ratingfive  With the future coming to now every day seems to be a new adventure 
len ratingfive This is the same case for Google Drive 
len ratingfive With smart sensitive technology this device and application can take you to new heights in transportation and personal computing 
len ratingfive Ride the wave of the future with Google Drive 
len ratingfive Some assembly required 
len ratingfive Absolutely love this app 
len ratingfive I love google photos tab 
len ratingfive  Love using Google Drive 
len ratingfive It is great for collaboration with other members of groups organizations to which one belongs 
len ratingfive Folder and file sharing is so easy 
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive Saves time and also saves space on home computer while keeping all my docs safe and organized and available anywhere and anytime I need 
len ratingfive  I can save photos on it 
len ratingfive Don t ask why that s the best but it is 
len ratingfive I can t stop using this app 
len ratingfive What can I say it s AMAZiNG 
len ratingone  Google need to enhance drive performance and improve user interface 
len ratingone Speed is the its frustrating to use drive at times which is why I gave star 
len ratingfour  Hey this app 
len ratingtwo  I had to use Drive for a job several years ago and have been using it since then but I find it clumsy and frustrating 
len ratingtwo I don t like the default organization of files uploaded to it 
len ratingtwo I usually spend so much time searching for my documents that I get sidetracked from whatever I am working on 
len ratingtwo I often give up and try alternative apps 
len ratingtwo I have been resisting using it as much as possible for over a year 
len ratingtwo I especially hate the way it made me use the Documents app to convert to PDF format 
len ratingtwo I have so many unnecessary copies of documents floating around between the two apps that waste storage space and add to the clutter and confusion that I associate with Drive 
len ratingtwo I appreciate apps products and programs that simplify projects 
len ratingtwo Google Drive can be helpful at times but it usually seems to complicate whatever I use it for 
len ratingfive  Made gmail my primary go to and drive works seamless and I love the convince of having my files easy to view and print 
len ratingfour Please add a widgets for recent files and a widget for uploading or scanning files etc 
len ratingfive  I ve spent the last years taking thousands of videos and photos of my toddler all saved on my iPhone and was so stressed out when I realized how many I had accumulated 
len ratingfive This was by FAR the easiest way to transfer and store my files 
len ratingfive Now I have more space on my iPhone with the convenience of having the files in the app 
len ratingfive Also love that it s accessible via web 
len ratingfive  totally my saving Grace 
len ratingone Don t let me be creative with my pictures 
len ratingfive  As usual it s spot on 
len ratingfour  This app is well ok It s is just a regular drive 
len ratingfour The reason I gave it instead of the five is because of some thing that you can do on the computer but not on the app but in all it a good at 
len ratingfour I like it because it comes with all the thing docs slides sheets etc i Think you should download this just because if you search it it will make you download it anyway
len ratingfive  I have a Sony camera I could only get shor videos to play on my IPad 
len ratingfive I tried several apps and could not get the Sony MPs to play 
len ratingfive Then I downloaded Google drive and imported the long videos into it 
len ratingfive Even the longest videos now play 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive  I use the Google cloud and it s a great way to share photos from my Android phone with my iPad Nook and computers 
len ratingone  To hard to download files
len ratingfive It s perfect I keep all my files here 
len ratingfive It makes life much easier 
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive You can save anything from PDFs to photos in seconds and access from anywhere 
len ratingone  Sorry but Not impressed
len ratingfive  While I have several brands of devices Google Drive allows me to upload docs to one place for easy access from any device especially when my office is mobile 
len ratingfive  Works great 
len ratingthree I like that there s a thumbnail for the image in this case a PSD 
len ratingthree Why can t I open it and see the full image 
len ratingfive With this age when one person has multiple appliances it doesn t make sense not to access it on all devices 
len ratingfive Which is why I love google drive 
len ratingfive Everything I need wherever I need it with a tap on one app 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingtwo  There are constant pop ups for me to rate the app 
len ratingtwo I finally did 
len ratingfive Bravo pour votre service 
len ratingfive  This app has renovated my entire life 
len ratingfour It would be awesome to be able to import notes from iPhone including embedded pictures 
len ratingfour Overall this is a very useful app and I would use it more if such a feature existed
len ratingfive  Two thumbs up 
len ratingfive No one better than google 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive  Offers me utility
len ratingfive  Google drive saves automatically and organizes all your stuff it is the best online program
len ratingfive  I use it everyday for school and it is a life saver

len ratingfive  I m a die hard Apple user and finding FREE unlimited photo storage on a different operating system make sure you select the right format to store your photos that seamlessly integrates with Apple is AMAZING 
len ratingfive I have so much more storage on my Apple devices now and I can recall any picture and or video back to my iPhone iPod or iPad when I want 
len ratingfive Download it now you won t regret it for a moment 
len ratingfour  I would give this app a five star rating but I just have one problem with it You can t edit on it You have to download all the other apps to edit the different things like slides and docs 
len ratingfour Overall this app is pretty good to have especially if you are in school and have lots of online projects and homework 
len ratingfour It s also really convenient if you have to upload stuff on your phone to drive because then you don t have to use a cord and wait forever for it to download 
len ratingfour It s really close to a five star but I still wish that all the other apps were combined with docs so you could edit everything on one app 
len ratingfive  Drive has become an essential online tool to organize and reference 
len ratingfive Fairly happy to have this tool Google Thank You

len ratingone  So I open up my Google Drive account today and I tried to open old documents I had saved only to find they had been replaced by bogus surveys on the sexual preferences of some of my Google contacts 
len ratingone Google as if I don t have to hear that crap enough on the news now they re invading my personal files and trolling on straight people there 
len ratingone Not cool 
len ratingone If this was done by Google as a way of finding out more about people then shame on Google for THAT being the first question they ask 
len ratingone If it was a hacker placing spam then Google needs to make sure their stuff is more secure 
len ratingone C mon Google get it together

len ratingfive  It s remarkable how much it impacted my business 
len ratingfive The ease of accessing files uploading and downloading from any mobile device or any device has made me more efficient and effective 
len ratingfour Great app but needs passcode lock function back or finger print scan
len ratingfive  I use this app a lot 
len ratingfive For school and personal use 
len ratingfive It s so convenient because I can access google drive anywhere 
len ratingfive Great app literally does it all

len ratingthree  Airplaying to Apple TV simply fails to function every single time

len ratingthree This does not include Screenmirroring which drains battery power significantly 
len ratingthree Please fix this major issue 
len ratingthree I think that it works really well for school use but right now I have an assignment that requires me to edit a video on my phone but I can t find any non complex ways to upload videos to my phone from my drive if you could fix that I would be fine 
len ratingfive  good
len ratingfive  Did I mention that I love this app 
len ratingfive FYI My review of Google Drive must include the suite of apps it contains like Docs Sheets etc 
len ratingfive This Google Product is wonderful 
len ratingfive It provides easy access to Google s entire suite of office applications 
len ratingfive I have found it so much easier to use than the corresponding APPLE apps 
len ratingfive I measure an app s quality based on how intuitive its features are 
len ratingfive I don t want to hunt and hunt for the tools and menus needed to perform basic generic functions 
len ratingfive I don like to read a mountain of tutorials to use oddly placed inadequately labeled tools and menus which I ve found in other apps with the exception of the Microsoft Suite 
len ratingfive The Google menus make sense to me 
len ratingfive The features are well placed and uncluttered 
len ratingfive The icons clearly tell you what they can do and have intuitive drop down menus As evidenced by the fact that I was able to create basic documents and spreadsheets within seconds of opening the app 
len ratingfive And finally help is easy to access when needed 
len ratingfive Oh yes and it s FREE 
len ratingfive PP
len ratingfive  I can t imagine getting things done without it 
len ratingfive  I have had problems with Drive totally crashing when I tried to switch between accounts 
len ratingfive Not sure if this affects everyone since I think I was switching from a personal to a school account but still it was so bad I had to delete and download the app itself 
len ratingfive Other than that it is excellence 
len ratingtwo  Interface is never what I expect 
len ratingtwo I wish it were as intuitive as Dropbox 
len ratingtwo  It s useful when the description says it s portable but you can t even edit anything 
len ratingtwo You have to get the other apps such as Docs and Slides 
len ratingtwo It s like I wasted so much of my time even downloading this 
len ratingtwo I ll just say it s a lot better on computer 
len ratingfive very useful anddependable
len ratingfive  I use this program daily 
len ratingfive I have catalogued every professional recipe I have ever made and use this as a quick reference throughout my day 
len ratingfive Highly recommend
len ratingfive  Great to share information and work as a team
len ratingfive  I m an Android person very happy with Google Drive 
len ratingfive Convenient when using multiple devices 
len ratingfive  Great App it s user friendly and easy to maintain 
len ratingfive Good app 
len ratingone For some reason every time I open work files from my google email acct 
len ratingone It s starting to get annoying especially because it s work related 
len ratingfive  Love the convenience of being able to easily share files with coworkers 
len ratingthree  I wish it was simpler to send item to others 
len ratingone Their was no need to remove the password lock you guys just remove a feature we use so that earns a star
len ratingfive  A great cross platform drive 
len ratingfive I can easily move files and that s important to me
len ratingfive  I love being able to open docs on my Mac iPhone or iPad 
len ratingfive Super easy to use 
len ratingfive Love Google Docs and the cloud storage 
len ratingone  unable to load photos takes min to load mb file 
len ratingone shame on google
len ratingfive  Everything works great
len ratingfive  I loveIt
len ratingfive  Much better than iCloud of oneDrive 
len ratingfive Great cloud service
len ratingfive Pretty Good
len ratingfive  I use it to deliver files to clients and it s never let me down 
len ratingfive  I had used drive for a few years and I love it 
len ratingfive I recommend to everyone
len ratingfive  I use this app a lot and it is very useful and helps keep my files organized
len ratingfive  My google drive be lookin Better den yurz
len ratingfive  Wow it is good
len ratingfive  I can access all my files offline and while I am on the go 
len ratingfive I like drive more then Dropbox 
len ratingfive  Excellent to have all my docs that I can access at anytime
len ratingfive amazing
len ratingfive  Great business tool and I take it everywhere 
len ratingfive Pros Nearest cloud based competitor in quality to MS Office and iWork More reliable cloud access than iWork NEW Notifications of any changes 
len ratingfive This is in addition to file comments NEW Assign Tasks to individuals within Comment system 
len ratingfive Cons Designed around composing documents instead of collaboration contrast w Quip where conversation is easy to see and central to user experience 
len ratingfive  Missing master task list of assignments responsible for or delegated by due date in all documents The once king of collaboration fell seriously behind Quip but has made a strong comeback while Quip innovation has slowed down since being acquired we re looking at you Salesforce 
len ratingfive Every download of those alternatives should be considered a vote against managers who stifled internal google efforts to innovate along conversational and project managment lines 
len ratingfive To the credit of the new collaborative improvements at Google Drive you can request updates for any doc you want to monitor closely but it is not the default so you don t have an Updates stream like that feature in Quip 
len ratingfive  Thank you 
len ratingfive This app is making it so easy to connect with and support my other team never sell over the county 
len ratingfive It has had a unifying effect on our team 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Serves my purpose as a place to keep genealogy files photos and documents 
len ratingfive I like that I am able to access all my files in one place
len ratingfive  When you need a document save it to your google drive 
len ratingfive It s available instantly 
len ratingfive Take it with you wherever you go 
len ratingfive This app is a life saver 
len ratingfive I truly enjoy being able to edit my documents on the go 
len ratingfive It is slightly difficult to edit in Sheets but PowerPoints and Docs are awesome 
len ratingfive  This has helped my instruction in so many ways 
len ratingfive As a teacher I m not sure who loses materials more me or the kids 
len ratingfive This solves the dog ate my homework and more 
len ratingfive Kids compose it s shared we can do peer review and student gets immediate feedback 
len ratingfive Editing is a breeze 
len ratingfive This has been an incredible boost to my classroom 
len ratingfive  Good app thank you so much
len ratingfive  Had to get with Google Drive due to faiure loss of my external hard drive so I m still trying to figure out exactly where all of my files are but I have retrieved some priceless family photos as well as some equally important family videos that I thought were lost forever 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Drive 
len ratingfive This is a great way to upload all my files and view them easily on my phone 
len ratingfive The option to save offline is also great for when I don t have reception or just to pull up quickly anytime anywhere 
len ratingfive  I ve been using the Google Drive app for a while now and love the easy interface it has to your actual online account 
len ratingfive I can find documents easy I can edit documents easy and I always have access to it whether on my laptop my phone or my iPad 
len ratingfive As a part time student of an online university having access to your school work when you need it is paramount and this app definitely provides great access 
len ratingfive  Convienient 
len ratingfive Word 
len ratingfive Sheets 
len ratingfive All easily and transparently assessable

len ratingfive This makes my job easier and allows me to more mobile and write whenever I want

len ratingone And I actually loved and used this app quite a bit 
len ratingone Well Bye Bye Google Drive and Hello Microsoft OneDrive

len ratingone  I think Google should pay for the reconstruction of my garage and replacement of my car in full 
len ratingone However I do apriciate the ability to share documents and information with other people 
len ratingone  Thank you 
len ratingone Sincerely ur pal
len ratingthree It needs download verification so that I know when someone has gotten the files or not 
len ratingfive  great

len ratingone Thought google is supposed to be cutting edge not old and dusty 
len ratingone Jus cause you update storage doesn t mean the apps don t need reworks with changing technology 
len ratingone Pretty bad when our guys are behind Microsoft again
len ratingfour Google doc works so well but does not let you draw
len ratingone  Need to fix it so all files are supported even on iPhones no files should be unsupported don t matter if it s iOS or android I have iPhone X but can t see my file cause it s unsupported
len ratingfive  Great app

len ratingone  We ll dropping this app from my phone 
len ratingone Now that I need to forward an Adobe Illustrator file to someone G Drive for iOS DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE Illustrator files therefore you cannot even see them

len ratingfive  Best storage service there is tried them all
len ratingfive  I have found everything I ever added to this app even after years or more ago

len ratingfive  The most amazing new programs I find are pro music apps

len ratingfive  Love
len ratingfour Still trying to download some photos to ny phone from drive but still haven t found out how 
len ratingfive I like google drive because it s free and easy to use 
len ratingfive  Google drive is the best on the friend when it comes to document management 
len ratingfive If you upload them you rest and get them when and where your need arises
len ratingfive  Deber an volver a poner clave de seguridad al entrar a la app 
len ratingfive Lo amaba 
len ratingthree  It s not half bad performance and speed is ok 
len ratingthree I think it s great especially with the feature with being able to sync all my documents from my computer to the online drive particularly nifty 
len ratingthree I wish it could do the reverse as well and sync all my documents from my Google Drive to my PC 
len ratingthree Another thing that would be nice is a passcode to enter before going into the app 
len ratingthree Like really we got some important docs on here so this should be already here it s basic shouldn t be needed to say 
len ratingfive  Pretty dope
len ratingfive Hope you will give more free GB space but thanks even for gb free its really useful 
len ratingfive  It is so easy and so convenient to use 
len ratingfive It is like a mobile office with me where ever I go 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  So much easier than using iTunes for talks and other audio files you only intend to listen to once 
len ratingfour  Doesn t get clingy with users you re trying to share with 
len ratingfour Would have been a Star but still won t let me download from phone to new folder that is recognized on pc 
len ratingfive  I use it to upload all my pics from my camera and get access to my phone quickly 
len ratingfive  I prefer this over drop box
len ratingfive  Thank you so much for Google 
len ratingfive I use only Google products 
len ratingfive They are safe authentic excellent personal and user super friendly 
len ratingfive Google Drive make you whatever whenever wherever 
len ratingfive She can take your everything with you 
len ratingfive Making my life a lot easier 
len ratingfive Thank you so much Google 
len ratingfive I am planning to use Gsuite in the future 
len ratingfive Thank you CEO and everyone in Google 
len ratingfive I used to using Google from 
len ratingfour  Works great for documents I store as a volunteer 
len ratingfive Muy bueno
len ratingfour  This is a really good app that allows people to view what s inside of their Google Drive and keep track of all the files documents videos slide shows drawling or presentations or anything else that people have done in all their years of school and it s also very useful because it organizes things by category 
len ratingfour People also use it to keep track of work or career things 
len ratingfour Everything that people put into their Google Drive stays safe if they log out of Google Drive after they are done using it 
len ratingfour I think it makes things easier and it s also easier to send emails or share what s in your Google Drive to other people when needed 
len ratingfive It s so easy to use so responsive helps a lot to me
len ratingfive  Drive is awesome 
len ratingfive It s a great way for me to store my weekly work schedules and other stuff 
len ratingfive Trouble free 
len ratingfive Plus just plain free 
len ratingfive I mean c mon that s awesome 
len ratingfive You know it is 
len ratingfour Great app except for the occasional not syncing 
len ratingthree This is typical google clunky interface but necessary 
len ratingone  Don t get it
len ratingfive  We re traveling the world for a few years no home base 
len ratingfive Drive has allowed us to take all important documents with us and to share as needed with family and the professionals in our lives 
len ratingfive  I ve been using Google Drive for five or six years now and honestly it s the greatest thing to happen to my writing 
len ratingfive So easy to whip out and jot something down to consider later 
len ratingfive I love how easily everything can be sorted and I ve never had any issues with the app or features 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work Google 
len ratingfive Read the title 
len ratingfive  I love google drive I love the app too 
len ratingfive  Very good 
len ratingfive  Plenty of capacity
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone It seems to download the high quality of you have both Google photos set at high quality even though I have set up Google backup and sync on my PC to save images at original 
len ratingfive The best app ever
len ratingone You can no longer keep your filed safe if your phone is unlocked 
len ratingfive  Since I am more than happy with this app I rate it 
len ratingthree But I really like Google access to everything
len ratingfive  Love having all my docs in one convenient location 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive  I love how no matter which device I m using I can always locate my files whenever needed on the drive 
len ratingfive  Sharing is caring
len ratingone  I love this app but why did you take away the privacy Google 
len ratingone Look at the Microsoft Outlook app for example they allow you to lock it to secure your emails but Google won t allow this feature for my photos documents 
len ratingone Before I had my Apple iPhone X whenever I went to the app it would prompt me to enter my passcode or use TouchID 
len ratingone Now that I have the iPhone X it states that my iPhone security is now the only option I have and that s the problem 
len ratingone If I hand someone my phone they can go into Google Drive 
len ratingone I liked having Google Drive still locked even when my phone was unlocked 
len ratingone Google you need to allow users to still be able to keep Google Drive locked even if their phone is unlocked 
len ratingone Just enable FaceID to come up everytime the app is opened as an option 
len ratingone Please don t take away options 
len ratingtwo Took away passcode
len ratingfive  I love this product 
len ratingfive Great way to store data and documents 
len ratingfive Now please stop asking me 
len ratingfive  Easy to use 
len ratingfive Links with your gmail account 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive This is a wonderful app 
len ratingfive It makes it very easy to navigate 
len ratingfive  Excellent app and very easy to use 
len ratingfive Google did a fantastic job designing the perfect GUI with logical and intuitive structure 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive  TOTALLY AWESOME AND AMAZING TWENTY OUT OF TEN 
len ratingfive  Useful Drive I put all my files on it 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive What a smooth and easy experience Google Drive is 
len ratingfive So clean so friendly so easy 
len ratingfive This really can make life easier for a lot of people 
len ratingfive I ve been a user of Dropbox for years 
len ratingfive This blows DB away 
len ratingfour  I love have a giant storage space for my pictures but I can only upload small amounts of photos at a time which can be one very time consuming 
len ratingfour Overall good app
len ratingfive Very seamless across all platforms 
len ratingfive Signing into multiple accounts is easy better than doing it on the web 
len ratingfive  Excelente
len ratingfive Reliable convenient all the space I need 
len ratingfive Everything you need easy to use 
len ratingfive Very convenient and easy to use 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive Extremely user friendly and has a convenient way to organize all of my files in folders while being alphabetically listed 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive For protecting files from cameras 
len ratingfive You can steel my computer but I have all your movements
len ratingfour  Google Drive is a very capable and easy to use app for cloud storage 
len ratingfour Definitely worth a try 
len ratingfour Google photos is also a great app 
len ratingfour  Love the simplicity of the app and the convenience it brings 
len ratingfour However searching for a file from the app would have been much better if you could sort by date or automatically last file saved in drive shows up in the top of the list 
len ratingfour  ok
len ratingfour  Seemed to work well before this update so I m actually just getting too check it out 
len ratingfive  perfect
len ratingone  why i can not buy more storage for year 
len ratingone why i just can buy storage for a month 
len ratingone and why i can not buy storage for life time 
len ratingfive  I don t know what I would do without my goggle drive app 
len ratingfive I m able to access my files wherever I am whether on the computer or through my phone 
len ratingfive I can t day enough about how great this app is 
len ratingfive A definite must have 
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive  So useful to organize and easier to use 
len ratingfour  Would like to be able to send multiple files at a time from my phone 
len ratingfour I work a lot from my iPhone and Drive will only allow me to attach one file at a time and sometimes I can not even attach certain files IF I ve already added my first attachment seems really basic 
len ratingfour If I need to send an accounting report to a client I should be able to click on the attachments I want to send and send them in one fell swoop 
len ratingfour Not so 
len ratingfour Very inconvenient because every time I need to send a big report I have to make sure I go home and do it on my computer like the olden days You d think they would have worked out a kink like this by now 
len ratingfour But otherwise the Drive app is great 
len ratingfive  Can t live without it now 
len ratingfive  The title says it all 
len ratingfive I use this for all kinds of documents 
len ratingfive Couldn t live without it 
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingfive I ve used it for years 
len ratingfive  Always have important documents with me 
len ratingfive Can access from anywhere
len ratingfive  This is a great app 
len ratingfive I totally love it
len ratingfour  Works great 
len ratingfour The only thing I see weird about it it s that it takes a while to download or process the Movies or videos 
len ratingtwo  App works fine but not having the passcode option anymore compromises a lot of my data and files in my drive 
len ratingtwo I don t see the rationale in removing the passcode from the app seeing as though we still sign into our drive with a password on any other medium 
len ratingtwo  stars until passcode is brought back 
len ratingone  Who decided to remove the passcode 
len ratingone Doesn t always refresh when I refresh it 
len ratingone I ve had allot of problems files will randomly end up in the trash at times 
len ratingone These guys aren t even trying to fix the bugs from last year 
len ratingfive  Great app and cloud storage 
len ratingfive Helps me save stuff on the go 
len ratingfive  Great for accessing your Google Drive on the go 
len ratingfive  This is awesome 
len ratingfive  This is the best back up 
len ratingfive So far it s not failed me thank you all who made this app what it is 
len ratingone Pior aplicativo da minha vida
len ratingfive I love you Google 
len ratingfive Don t know what I d do without you 
len ratingthree  How do you secure the app 
len ratingthree I don t want anyone to just open the app and look through my photos what happen 
len ratingthree Why did you make the app unsecured 
len ratingfive  This app really comes in handy when I want to access my files while I m on the go or when I don t want to be on my computer 
len ratingfive I love the flexibility it affords me 
len ratingthree  They had a great lockcode feature that they disabled 
len ratingthree Otherwise it is a free gb but a little too easy to display 
len ratingfive I m learning how to do some trading and this is one of the Best strategy as a learning tool their is by far 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone  I have personally used Google Drive for years so far mostly to collaborate with my associates on projects and it has been an invaluable resource I ve been grateful to have 
len ratingone However as of recent I believe the functionality has taken a nosedive 
len ratingone Uploading and moving files now causes drive to crash I can t even create folders anymore and I ve also been having the app glitch in various ways making the whole app almost completely unusable 
len ratingone Needless to say I am left at a loss 
len ratingone I want to keep using drive but at this time the costs are outweighing the benefits 
len ratingfive Great to access documents like music sheets I carry around 
len ratingone  As usual with Google products they are all flashy on the outside and promise to perform flawlessly 
len ratingone In reality their software is all buggy and unresponsive 
len ratingone There s never anyone available from tech support 
len ratingone I just tried to read a text document on my phone not revise it just open it Drive couldn t open it 
len ratingone The cryptic error only says problem with file 
len ratingone Google any of their products is a great idea with an extremely poor implementation 
len ratingfour  I find it to be extremely useful when having multiple devices whether they out of the same or different labels this app drains all your pictures and movies and clips whatever you can store at your fingertips from one device to the other
len ratingfive Wonderful app for coordinating team efforts and sharing info 
len ratingfive  Google drive is great 
len ratingfive I have been experiencing a slight issue with some mp audio that I have saved 
len ratingfive Playback stops suddenly at random parts and I have to start from the beginning 
len ratingfive I used to not have issues but that has been happening on phone and on Ipad in recent weeks
len ratingfive  Very helpful app
len ratingfive  Amazing makes things so organized
len ratingfive  The most versatile cloud sharing app hands down 
len ratingfive I use drive all the time for school and work 
len ratingfive It is so helpful when I am on the go to have this on my phone 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive for just about everything 
len ratingfive The iPhone app is super reliable and has saved my bacon countless times for looking up or backing up 
len ratingfive work and personal files 
len ratingfive This should come installed on every smartphone 
len ratingfour Fantastic tool for managing my field data overall 
len ratingfour Truly 
len ratingfour A great piece of work with a two significant issues according to my use 
len ratingfour The first is that it is much to difficult to download multiple pictures videos or files to my physical device from the app two menus in which is a necessity when I travel to remote regions without internet access 
len ratingfour The second is that when you have thousands of files they do not load all at once 
len ratingfour I have to scroll to load and scroll and scroll making it very difficult to find what I need rename files or locate a specific piece of field data within the app 
len ratingfour Also the search is iffy for item details details where I often put codes for my research on photos videos etc 
len ratingfour Sometimes it searches these and sometimes it doesn t 
len ratingfour A reliable tag function would be supremely useful 
len ratingfive  Must have tool for companies to collaborate and share data
len ratingthree  Downloading video is not intuitive like downloading photos look forward to them figuring that out 
len ratingfive  We are part of a statewide system 
len ratingfive This is what we use to share resources 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It s so accessible and easy to store docs and pics 
len ratingfive I love that it takes the place of a thumb drive 
len ratingfive So glad I tried this app 
len ratingfive  It s awesome
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Really dumb pop up reminder 
len ratingone  App is fine but wouldn t stop prompting me every single tap until I rated it 
len ratingone So here s that rating you insisted on 
len ratingfive  I use a shared drive with coworkers every day 
len ratingfive It works flawlessly 
len ratingone  Google Drive is slow to adopt new iOS technologies and when it eventually does it does them in a strange or incomplete manner 
len ratingone This app feels out of place on iOS and that causes it to be frustrating to use 
len ratingone If I could by day to day without needing to use Google Drive I would exorcise it from my iPad post haste 
len ratingfive  So far so good seems to be bulletproof
len ratingfive  No complaints 
len ratingfive This app is a lifesaver for anyone running a business 
len ratingfive I have all my documents on all of my devices all of the time 
len ratingfive Can t be beat 
len ratingone  Not allowing me to upload work related files even though I pay a monthly fee
len ratingfive  Never had any issues with Google Drive 
len ratingfive I ve been using it for years now to store all my work pictures schedules etc 
len ratingfive I even use it to collaborate with my dev team for our game projects 
len ratingfive Love Drive
len ratingfive  They just keep improving
len ratingfive  This is a great app enabling me to access my documents on multiple devices
len ratingfive  Enjoy this app especially when looking for employment 
len ratingfive All of the information I need is available at my fingertips 
len ratingone  Ruined every single photo 
len ratingone Made them all out of Focus 
len ratingone And this was Deliberate cause they were not this way when I took them 
len ratingone Until they went into Google Drive 
len ratingone What the HELL happened 
len ratingone Google 
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingtwo  When you select a link and it opens like different programs one after another to do anything
len ratingfive Works seamlessly across many devices including all of my iStuff phones iPads Macs PC 
len ratingfive Use it frequently for sharing big PowerPoint presentations that are too big to send via email 
len ratingfive I love it so convenient 
len ratingfive Unbelievably useful for my teaching
len ratingone  Canceled my yearly subscription and deleted the app I m done 
len ratingfour  I love how I have so much Storage in space for almost anything I need 
len ratingfour And it s accessible anywhere just need my gmail BUT the only thing that bothers me is it s speed performance when I am uploading anything from photos and videos or even projects it could take longer than the whole night to move files over 
len ratingfive  google drive 
len ratingone  Why can we not access Google Forms directly from Google Drive or from the Docs App like we do the other file types 
len ratingone It forces us to the web sometimes the Form does not show up either in Drive OR Docs file listings 
len ratingone The only consistent method i ve found is to goto the Forms URL directly which eventually dumps me into Google Docs anyway 
len ratingone Accessing Forms from a mobile device in order to manage them is a joke 
len ratingone Make Forma more directly accessed and integrated via the Apss 
len ratingfive Sandiya
len ratingfive  Drive app is incredibly useful on my phone for access to various files that our family uses daily 
len ratingfive Game changer for me to stay organized and in touch
len ratingfive Helps keep School Work up 
len ratingfive  I use the google drive and google tools for my personal and work life 
len ratingfive They are easy to use and the apps are great 
len ratingfive  I love that I can store all my documents in one place 
len ratingfive  A 
len ratingfive  Makes my teaching and coaching life a breeze 
len ratingfive Stores all my files and I can work on them anywhere 
len ratingfive  I love G Suite apps 
len ratingfive I use it for multiple small businesses and are working on creating a CRM package and consulting for small businesses using G Suite 
len ratingfive Huge freakin fan 
len ratingfive  Very convenient and Great
len ratingthree  If possible please bring the passcode lock option for the app back 
len ratingfive  Thanks very much for this nice product Hasan
len ratingfive  We are predominantly an apple family but Google drive brings many of us together A great app and easy to use
len ratingone  I ve used drive for YEARS 
len ratingone It s had everything from games to photos to documents and having an app is great 
len ratingone I can pull up and save pictures on my phone and have them tied to the google stuff I ve used for so long 
len ratingone This last update however has a really big issue for me in that it removed passcode lock 
len ratingone WHY 
len ratingone Why would you do that 
len ratingone It bothered me about it for a while saying I should turn it off and finally I played with the setting to try to make the nagging notification leave only to realize that I couldn t turn it back on 
len ratingone This isn t a bug it s an intentional feature 
len ratingone I often have to let other people use my phone and I do not want them to be able to look in my drive 
len ratingone I have years of sensitive data in there and now I can t protect it when my phone is unlocked 
len ratingone This wouldn t bother me so much if I had been using the lock regardless after the update only to have it trick me into disabling it permanently 
len ratingone This makes the app almost useless to me am I supposed to delete drive when someone uses my phone 
len ratingone Aside from that it s also extremely pointless to have to switch apps just to look at a text document 
len ratingone The drive app can open pictures and video and not much else 
len ratingone What s the point of it then 
len ratingone If it s supposed to be the most general purpose app as opposed to say docs it seems reasonable it should at least be able to open every file type without requiring entire other apps 
len ratingone It just disrupts the workflow especially since the layout of docs is crap and I have to go back to drive to switch documents 
len ratingone Drive will not even look at a file that can be opened in another drive app 
len ratingone Drive has been so great for a very long time but this app does the absolute bare minimum to utilize it 
len ratingone It s useful but not nearly as much as it should be and I can t rate it more than one star until it seems like they at least tried to make it as useful as it can be 
len ratingone This last update was just a big step backwards so I m not very optimistic 
len ratingone Here s hoping I guess 
len ratingtwo  Unlimited storage would be great 
len ratingfive  this is the greatest program 
len ratingfive it brought me through college and life as an adult in writing anything 
len ratingfive thanks a whole bunch 
len ratingone  Why did you delete the program PIN 
len ratingfive  Kicks dropboxs butt huge fan of price and storage capability and how easy it is to use
len ratingfive  Use the Google Drive app to organize every aspect of my life professional academic and otherwise 
len ratingfive  I love good drive 
len ratingfive I use t for everything from school work to resumes to making shopping lists and workout plans 
len ratingfive It s super useful because I can access it anywhere theirs internet 
len ratingfive It s a lot easier than lugging my laptop around or having to remember a thumb drive that doesn t have much memory 
len ratingfive And it saved my pictures 
len ratingfive My Apple IPhone randomly erases my pics because of lack of gigs and consequently it erases them from the ICloud 
len ratingfive My savior is Goggle Drive 
len ratingfive Which saved them for me and now I can retrieve them without any worry 
len ratingfive I highly recommend Google Drive 
len ratingfive It s worth it 
len ratingfive  El servicio que presta Google Drive es inestimable por su capacidad de almacenamiento y sobre todo por la comunicabilidad

len ratingone  Since about updates previous every time I leave an audio file to play it will crash after random intervals of time 
len ratingone It is quite annoying please fix asap
len ratingone Won t even open on my phone
len ratingfive  Ha ha totally blind user I have found if I have to be very acceptable 
len ratingfive Yes something I think need to be improved but for the most part it is very do their family for people who need to use the screen will be there 
len ratingthree  Google drive sync needs to be improved 
len ratingthree It dramatically slows down other processes when running 
len ratingfive Love the entire Google line of apps 
len ratingfive They just work 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a really AWSOME thing because it can help save and remember things for school work etc 
len ratingfive Google Drive can also allow you to use Google Docs Google Slides etc 
len ratingfive This app can help you in school a lot for notes writing assignments etc 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive  Never miss those precious moments 
len ratingfive Make as many memories as you can 
len ratingfive  I can find everything in one place 
len ratingfive No more backing up to CD or external drives 
len ratingtwo Making teachers work easier 
len ratingtwo Thanks google 
len ratingtwo  I like the look of this app and I like the fact that it s part of the Google ecosystem 
len ratingtwo I really tried hard to make this app work for me but there is one missing feature that is a complete nonstarter 
len ratingtwo I cannot download entire folders a for offline use 
len ratingtwo If I want to download files for offline use I have to go to each individual file and mark them as such 
len ratingtwo This is a horrendous user experience 
len ratingtwo I travel a lot and find myself needing flight confirmations travel plans documents and work related files when I m flying at airports or checking into places in foreign countries 
len ratingtwo The fact that I cannot easily do this with this app is an absolute dealbreaker 
len ratingtwo If the devs add this feature then I ll be back to give this another try 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is amazing 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive You can use it anytime anywhere on anything 
len ratingfive It is just amazing 
len ratingfive I can use it on my iPad at school then go home and use it my computer then take a trip and use it on my phone 
len ratingfive How awesome is that 
len ratingfive I just love it 
len ratingone  No Touch ID or Passcode lock insecure 
len ratingone Period 
len ratingone If someone snatches my unlocked phone as I talk all my important documents are exposed 
len ratingone It took Google ages to add support for passcode lock and now it s been removed sigh 
len ratingone I am too loyal to cancel my subscription still but if the feature is not back in reasonable time I don t think I have an option to keep using Drive for the record I pay mo for TB 
len ratingone I m giving Google Drive Business days to bring back the Passcode Lock or I m leaving Google Drive 
len ratingone It s NO LONGER secure TF
len ratingone Had to remove this app due to the removal of passcode lock 
len ratingone Now searching for a new provider that allows me to secure my files 
len ratingone Thanks a lot google 
len ratingfive  Mi mejor aplicaci n para almacenar datos integrada con el correo y otras funcionalidades de Google

len ratingfive I can use my phone laptop or PC to easily access and organize information 
len ratingthree  It keeps reading something went wrong try again later 
len ratingfive  I use it for storing and readings PDFs on iPad good for reading
len ratingfive Thanks for another awesome app 
len ratingthree  Please kindly add passcode lock on google drive 
len ratingone  Removed the passcode lock without explanation 
len ratingone Touch ID is not sufficient when handing phone to others kids to use 
len ratingone Too much risk of files getting accidently deleted etc 
len ratingone iOS s lack of user accounts makes the passcode a very useful feature and accounts for its presence on virtually every other file management app on iOS 
len ratingthree Passcode was like the reason why I loved this app 
len ratingthree They got rid of it for security reasons or something 
len ratingthree Now I can t lock my documents so much for security right 
len ratingone The only reason why I gave this app one star is for fact that I can t give it a 
len ratingfour  It would be awesome if I had the option to view the details for pictures an documents 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive  Google drive is so easy to use 
len ratingfive I love that I can access all my documents across all of my devices 
len ratingfive It s wonderful that I can back up photos to google drive as well 
len ratingfive It does take awhile to initially upload all of your photos at once but if you periodically do it after that it shouldn t take so long 
len ratingfive The other great thing about google drive is that it s pretty intuitive and easy to use so it s not hard to get used to 
len ratingfive Overall an excellent organizational app 
len ratingtwo  But now its unsupported files folders I don t recognize uploads don t show up it s just annoying 
len ratingfive I was able to recover all of my lost pics 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfour Make the docs more accessible
len ratingfive  Being military and having to relocate often it has been a huge help to always have access to our important documents and forms in the palm of our hands or anywhere there s internet access 
len ratingthree  It s annoying 
len ratingthree Not as useful for scanning docs as android app
len ratingfive  Great app for organizing and creating documents in the Google Cloud 
len ratingfive This is very good for school
len ratingtwo  Quit asking me over and over and over to rate it within minute
len ratingone  Keeps asking to be rated annoying
len ratingfive I am able to share larger files like videos or photos so that it may be used on different social media and website platforms 
len ratingfive Vary simple 
len ratingfive Barely elegant 
len ratingfive Vary easy to make things in the g suite

len ratingone Annoying pop ups 
len ratingfive  Muy til
len ratingone Constantly bothers about feedback 
len ratingone Wants permission to push notifications 
len ratingone Annoying that you have to use Drive to simply add an attachment to Inbox rather than being able to pull from iCloud 
len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingfour  It s wonderful to have so much Drive functionality right here on my phone 
len ratingfour I would ve given five stars but the app s constant pestering to leave a review irritated me 
len ratingfive  I love this app

len ratingone I feel like I m never sure what others can see on my drive 
len ratingone I don t like how collaboration has no easy tracking and I want to approve the sharing of a folder I create and share 
len ratingfive  absolutely fantastic application
len ratingfive  Great for mobile to get what I need when I need it
len ratingone  I don t want junk mail showing up on my Google Drive account
len ratingone  Nothing downloads off my phone big fat It did before but now smh won t even download GODDAMN pic 
len ratingone Starting to HATE you google 
len ratingfour  Love the app and the mobility it provides the user wish the loading time was faster even when its on WiFi otherwise highly recommend 
len ratingfive Ti n d ng
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingone Stop asking to review the app after viewing and closing files 
len ratingfive  I can keep an extra backup of all my things

len ratingfive  I have a lot of spreadsheets that I am always updating and when I am on the go I use the app to keep everything in order 
len ratingfive  Amazing Cloud

len ratingone Cant get all sub drives to show up 
len ratingfive  I really rely n depend on google Drive and haven t had any issues yet
len ratingfive A good place to store my documents so I don t have to look for a lost thumb drive that has my assignments on them 
len ratingfive  The Google drive app is very helpful for sending pics for school projects

len ratingone I ve done everything to stop 
len ratingone I ve lost all my photos 
len ratingone Really really upset
len ratingfive  Very reliable and perfect for on the go 
len ratingfive Outstanding app for viewing files or editing in just one app 
len ratingfive Google developers truly put effort and time into these apps 
len ratingone Google photos has been saving pictures from my phone without my permission or me even having the app downloaded on my phone 
len ratingone I feel their practice of automatically adding this feature to my phone and no clear opt out option to be an extreme violation of privacy 
len ratingfive  Google drive is a super app that helps you to manage professional and personal information 
len ratingfive It is clearly one of my favorite apps 
len ratingfive I ve tried several different forms of sharing large volumes of photos and videos with my family but Google Drive is by far the easiest to use

len ratingfour  Using it on my phone is super easy not to mention using it on my computer 
len ratingfour Unlimited storage 
len ratingfour Compatible with other devices and operating systems 
len ratingfive  It just simply works as a storage for my electronic data
len ratingfour Saving docs to Google drive from multiple devices causes some docs to save as errors 
len ratingfour Sometimes they don t save at all 
len ratingfour Sometimes they just disappear 
len ratingfour Pages saves like garbage 
len ratingfour One Pages file saves as a folder with a bunch of junk in it 
len ratingfour The file you want to open is actually called a preview in the folder 
len ratingfour Weird 
len ratingfour That being said once you get your docs to save it s nice having access to your files from anywhere 
len ratingfour I wish you could save audio video picture files here too 
len ratingfive  I use it to save documents from my iPhone 
len ratingfive I wasn t surprised to find out this past holiday other family members do too 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and integrates well with the other Google apps 
len ratingfive  Es f cil de usar y te permite tener todos tus archivos en cualquier lugar y con cualquier dispositivo 
len ratingone  Star because times in the first minute of use it asked me to rate it 
len ratingfour  Easy enough to check file status and get an overview on the G Drive 
len ratingfour Confusing file structure but it is consistent with the desktop version so maybe it s just me 
len ratingfive  Nothing better than an EASY way to view organize print photos 
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingfour  Great for non secure documents 
len ratingfour I m not sure why they removed the extra passcode option on iphones and ipads 
len ratingfour It s too bad 
len ratingone I downloaded a lot of files n they all come up unsupported 
len ratingone So why was I prompted to get this app 
len ratingone Darn lot of work going back n redoing

len ratingfive After searching and test using variety of cloud based storage systems I chose to go with google drive due to many advantages that come with it 
len ratingfive Notably among them is painless real time access by people I share my media folders with 
len ratingfive  My computer recently bit the dust and it has been so helpful to have Drive both because of the files I ve already saved and because of the work I can continue to save just by being online 
len ratingfive  Word files saved on my computer on the other hand Hard drive please live so I can retrieve them ToT 
len ratingone Or I will move to OneDrive which is more secured 
len ratingfour  The best app for storage ever 
len ratingfour I hope you ll increase its storage capacity 
len ratingfour  All these Store all your sh t online apps make me a little nervous But hopefully its just paranoia 
len ratingfour  Clean interface easy to use app 
len ratingfour I only wish we got more free storage or made the monthly upgrade cheaper 
len ratingfour Other than that great app everyone uses Google Drive 
len ratingfour More convenient and easier to use than Dropbox 
len ratingfive Works fine 
len ratingfive Hoyos

len ratingthree Ill keep trying
len ratingfive  The Google Drive app is great for anyone who has a low amount of storage on their phone 
len ratingfive Using the Google Photos section of the app you can sync all of your photos and videos to the cloud without using any storage 
len ratingfive This is also possible with the Google Photos app but you can also do that in this app as well as many other features 
len ratingfive This app is also great to download content from a computer to your phone 
len ratingfive Since everything is saved online you can open and download anything from any platform

len ratingfive In it s basic function it allows mobile users to send store share convert all of the documents that are usually only accessible through a desktop platform 
len ratingfive I m highly impressed with the interoperability of the app with the ios suite and find it easy to switch back and forth between the platforms while working remotely 
len ratingfive This ability to manipulate documents in the apps is critical to the next stages of mobile platform technology 
len ratingone  Bad
len ratingfive  Works great 
len ratingfive Easy customizable share options for files and pictures 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive  The ability to create albums and files for your content is great for separating school work by class and just separating photos by occasion

len ratingone  Used to be a great spreadsheet to use easily on my phone 
len ratingone However an update was made a few months ago which disabled the ability to make corrections to the beginning of any cells if a sentence exceeds several words

len ratingfive  I love Google drive and docs and the way they all work together 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone  Feels a little low power
len ratingfive Superb Extremely user friendly Idiot proof Even free version allows back up of recordings on Google Drive

len ratingfive  I am happy with my Apple drive it s always there when I need it 
len ratingfour  I started using Google Drive about years ago starting small and quickly adding applications and lessons 
len ratingfour Google Forms has become my sole source of homework for high school science classes 
len ratingfour I have also converted some of my labs to Google Forms I love the fact that students can add documents to the form 
len ratingfour I have attached short videos to give students the ability to review or clarify directions 
len ratingfour Sheets and Docs have many options for lessons and data analysis 
len ratingfour Sheets has templates for grade books 
len ratingfour Students can share data or written information to collaborate when working in groups 
len ratingfour They have learned how to attach photos to Forms and Docs 
len ratingfour The only thing I have not figured out how to do is link the student grade in Sheets to a specific email address 
len ratingfour Kind of like the old mail merge idea but with the ability to let parents access current grades 
len ratingfive  Works great never crashes easy to use
len ratingfive  Excellent

len ratingfive Looking forward to more 
len ratingfive  A very good app for online storage

len ratingfive It s super useful and almost never buggy 
len ratingfive Document storage and on command retrieval is super important today and this app obvious knows and accomplishes it 
len ratingfive  I couldn t function without Drive 
len ratingfive I use it for personal work and ministry 
len ratingfive It has replaced my desktop computer and now I function solely from and iPad and iPhone 
len ratingfive I would like to see a few more built in apps in the future

len ratingfour It won t play iphone videos anymore that were made with the new codec 
len ratingfive  This App is so resourceful for many reasons and one of them is in classroom it helps so much because we use Google Classroom and when the students need to submit something they use Google Drive and also they save things to there Drive to make it easier to access 
len ratingfive Thank You so much Google for creating this very resourceful app 
len ratingfive I find google drive to be very convenient for accessing and sharing files without being tethered to a particular device 
len ratingfive The upload download is faster than with other similar tools I have used 
len ratingone  The loading process to upload my music takes way too long 
len ratingfive Love drive 
len ratingfive Keeps my personal information safe for me to upload off of all devices 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfour Very good
len ratingfour It is all useful but their is some small lose of privacy for a large amount of utility 
len ratingfive  Sharing video files is much better than In DB although DB also has some features GDrive lacks such as file requests 
len ratingfive Overall Drive indispensable 
len ratingfive  Good for backup but slight issues with file transfer between platforms
len ratingone When I m trying to save a video to my camera roll on my iPhone but it takes fifteen to thirty minutes to save a minute video And sometimes when it s done loading it doesn t even save to my camera roll
len ratingfive  I luv google docs but it has toilet problems
len ratingthree Please put some sort of security feature back on the app 
len ratingfour  The service as a whole is wonderful but the mobile app does force close from time to time when accessing files which can be frustrating 
len ratingthree  Using iPad Pro I wish it would open my document app whenever it opened a page because i have to reopen the document each time I switch between programs 
len ratingfive Mcdofbfpg
len ratingone  Well usually it s awesome but I keep running into blocks right now 
len ratingfive  It is a great resource that helps me stay connected across computer platforms and acts as a valued backup 
len ratingone  It doesn t work on my phone and I need it for school 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive  Very convenient to keep file only you need to update able to keep one file to keep add on
len ratingfive  My portable office 
len ratingfive I ve been able to accomplish so much using Drive 
len ratingone  Can t select multiple photos to save to camera roll
len ratingone  Until the most recent update this app was great for work and generally organizing life and projects now it won t even open so it s useless 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingone I want the program to file the photos based on when the shots were taken not loaded 
len ratingone Is there a way to sequentiality photos now 
len ratingfive I used Drive on my Android while traveling and I am so GRATEFUL for its backup ability capacity and speed That allowed me to FREE UP SPACE on my smartphone and keep on recording and uploading high quality videos 
len ratingfive I am wondering how to do the same on my Iphone since only pics have been effectively uploaded to Drive so far Maybe it s the Internet connection

len ratingfive  I am able to access my documents on Google drive from any place with any type of device 
len ratingfive Great for getting work done 
len ratingtwo  Asks for a review so often that it makes the app hard to use
len ratingfive I m a college student and Google service is one of the essential parts of my everyday life 
len ratingfive From writing papers and keeping all my books in one place I could ask for a better organizer and the best part of it s accessible from anywhere 
len ratingfive I love that I can access my stuff from anywhere 
len ratingfive I sometimes prefer using the app to the actual website because the layout is so clear and makes things easy to navigate 
len ratingfive It s much simpler to organise and start documents even if you change the formatting later on the website 
len ratingfive  Very fluid and easy to use especially on mobile 
len ratingfive Very useful application 
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingfive I use Drive all the time 
len ratingfive My daughter just showed me the convenience of using this its great

len ratingfive  Excelente herramienta para trabajar desde cualquier dispositivo 
len ratingfive Cuenta con todas las comodidades conocidas 
len ratingfive Una manera segura para almacenar los documentos 
len ratingthree Awesome to have access to my google drive but search doesn t work great 
len ratingthree For example I have a file called Journal but if I search for Journal nothing comes up but if I search for Journal then it does come up 
len ratingthree Also my folders are strewn with files beginning with which I believe are temporary files which have been deleted and don t show up in my desktop google drive 
len ratingthree  Would be nice to be able to search on the desktop folder for items stored on the drive 
len ratingfour But my share links are blocked by many corporate networks 
len ratingfour Kind of a bummer when trying to share docs between colleagues and they can t access them 
len ratingfour Not google s fault tho 
len ratingfour Quickly accessible nice layout and easy to use 
len ratingone  I use to love this app until they removed the passcode Touch ID lock 
len ratingfour  It is a great app the inly problem is it can hard to find things 
len ratingfive Love this app is Vera useful I put everything there and I am doing everything online 
len ratingfive  I love this application
len ratingfive  Great App 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive Having everything in one place and easily able to organize it on the fly 
len ratingone Asked for a review every time I closed a document
len ratingfive What can I say works great and get more space then the wannabes pictures data always at you finger tips on all systems or devices I always keep back ups though gb s of space to store but I like all my stuff on my devices
len ratingfour  Have it on all of my devices 
len ratingfive Love it ever and always 
len ratingfive never fails 
len ratingfour  Great 
len ratingfive Seamless functionality on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Virtually every desktop feature is available 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive  Drive is GREAT 
len ratingfive  I love how keep your fotos and videos safe if you loose your phone
len ratingtwo  I did this so i can upload larger videos to imovie still cant add my videos to imovie real annoyed 
len ratingfive  Main drawback of Drive is loss of access to files when no data 
len ratingfive Available offline only available for files doesn t scale to hundreds of docs 
len ratingfive Please enable for folders 
len ratingfive Can follow folder sharing type logic 
len ratingfive Perfect for homework easily accessible and super fun to use 
len ratingfive  I use google docs for everything 
len ratingfive Love having as an app 
len ratingfive I can write poetry make notes do school work on the go 
len ratingfive It s always been great for me 
len ratingone  Works great but recently started asking for a review every seconds unusable 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive This is a great tool that is easy for all users 
len ratingone Irrespective of internet it is very slow 
len ratingfive I use the drive app on my phone and it makes work so much easier 
len ratingfive Works great I can do work on a laptop or my phone 
len ratingfive It also makes it easy to save things to the cloud on the fly 
len ratingfive It keeps me very organized and is good for business school and etc 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It helps you plan out things for the future and also is a typing program 
len ratingfive You can create documents slideshows excels and more 
len ratingfive This app protects your files in which you can keep them ALL the time 
len ratingfive It even saves automatically 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive I love this application because It allows me access to important documents wherever I go on any electronic device 
len ratingfive I don t need to have my computer with me to do this 
len ratingfive I also like being able to create Google links to videos and photos so that I can forward to other people and avoid having to send large files 
len ratingfive  It s great helps out a lot
len ratingfive This tool is great 
len ratingfive I can access my files from any of my devices 
len ratingfive The amount of data they allow for free is way more than Apple and the ability to share files is simple 
len ratingfive I have worked simultaneously on a shared doc while discussing it on the phone with a coworker 
len ratingfive I m a big fan of google drive 
len ratingfive And it costs much less than apple s iCloud 
len ratingfive  I use Drive all the time 
len ratingfive The only thing I would change would be to make it easier to copy and move folders
len ratingfive  I love having this 
len ratingfive Keeps my animations that I have been working on safe and making sure that I don t delete them accidentally 
len ratingfive  I Love GD
len ratingone Touch system is no longer
len ratingfour  Excellent sharing tool 
len ratingfour I primarily use to keep up with documents across multiple devices and as the title clearly suggests it has saved my bacon a few times 
len ratingfour  Great app to use it in phone 
len ratingone Google drive does not support team folder integration with other mass adopted business applications strangely enough 
len ratingone Googles explanation for the deficiency is that team folders are beta 
len ratingone I m trying to figure out how to verify my phone pics have been uploaded and drive keeps bugging me to rate it and I keep clicking dismiss and not now 
len ratingone Since it wouldn t stop it gets a star rating 
len ratingone I am paying for this service 
len ratingone It should be easier to organize on a smartphone and not beg me to rate it several times when I am in the middle of trying to figure out if it s even syncing my photos 
len ratingfive As a teacher I use Google suite for everything 
len ratingfive It auto saves tracks changes and is accessible from all my devices 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfour  Hi there 
len ratingfour I ve enjoyed google drive on my phone for over a year 
len ratingfour I mostly listen to audio files I have purchased and copied to the drive 
len ratingfour Lately the app has been turning off in the middle of the Audios often 
len ratingfour I love the app 
len ratingfour Please fix the bug 
len ratingfour Cool but the app can t support some file types like ogg when I m on mobile 
len ratingone  Extremely annoyed to be getting solicitations through my Google Drive 
len ratingone This will ultimately lead to the closing of my account 
len ratingfive  I use it to transfer my videos for YouTube 
len ratingone Porn spam messages every day
len ratingfour Thank you for this
len ratingfour  Every thing OK just take care the safety of our docs 
len ratingfour We trust in you 
len ratingfour You guys will be the Last BASTION spanish 
len ratingfour Keep your weapons on against intruders 
len ratingfour I work with Apple OS only time ago 
len ratingfour From then I do not know what mean virus

len ratingone  I m no longer able to upload my photos 
len ratingone Please start testing your apps 
len ratingfive  this app have saved me countless times 
len ratingfive i love google drive 
len ratingfive so convenient and worry free 
len ratingfive i used it at work and never stopped using it even as a stay at home mom 
len ratingone  The video didn t play 
len ratingone Simple MP video didn t work 
len ratingone Can t believe it 
len ratingone Very limited functionality 
len ratingone Wish google can make t work for every type of file 
len ratingfive  It is great to be able to share documents with my friends and get feedback from my teachers 
len ratingfive I have never had a problem with any of the Google apps 
len ratingfive Forget the old boxes drive is where all your stuff is already 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It has saved me a world of headache 
len ratingfive When your device crashes and you literally have almost your entire life on it it hurts 
len ratingfive But the Drive makes it a no loss 
len ratingfive It s a great way for you to store things you may need for work and or school 
len ratingfive It s great to help with essays or help sell an item 
len ratingfive I m constantly using it at least once a day and I store pictures that I want to last for a long time and documents and slides that I ll eventually need in school 
len ratingone  Get while screen with word docs can t search in text files 
len ratingone Terrible app
len ratingfive  Gracias muy agradecido por todos 
len ratingfour Rates stars because of missing functionality to change link sharing permissions for a folder 
len ratingfour I say missing because on the computer GDrive allows me to change the sharing permissions to the public but in the app I can only change edit view permissions within my group 
len ratingfour I can t make the link public for folders 
len ratingone You re welcome google thanks for asking
len ratingfive This app does all that it claims and meets all of my storage and word processing needs 
len ratingfive I just love using google drive 
len ratingfive Its great and very flexible 
len ratingfive It almost solved my all storage and flexible document access problems and just made me smile 
len ratingfive I can handle my documents systematically which i love to do 
len ratingone  One star because i hate review me pop ups 
len ratingone  Aggravating as heck 
len ratingthree  I use Drive to upload songs I ve been working on so I can listen to them from my phone 
len ratingthree The in app audio player often causes the app to crash if I try to listen with my phone locked it stops mid playback and when I unlock my phone it s gone back to my home screen and I have to relaunch the app 
len ratingthree I know not many people might use the audio playback function on this app but I imagine this would have an easy fix so please smoosh this bug
len ratingfour I was surprised on how this app keeps my files organized 
len ratingfour Very useful 
len ratingthree  Thanks GOOGLE
len ratingfive En contre archivos que pens que av a perdido
len ratingfive  I use this app daily for viewing files on both my laptop and my iPad 
len ratingfive I have over GB of music and files stored on my account 
len ratingfive Data storage rates are very reasonable 
len ratingone  Bring the pin code back 
len ratingone Drive is not secure anymore 
len ratingtwo  I can t upload a song from Garage band to Drive 
len ratingtwo I don t know if it s the new upgrade or the drive itself can you please check and if it s posible upgrade some stuff this is iOS 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingone I see random files in my drive 
len ratingone Plits etc 
len ratingone  I actually like the app ok 
len ratingone But it started asking me to rate it after I closed EVERY file 
len ratingone I tried to dismiss till later but it kept nagging me 
len ratingone So I give it star 
len ratingone BOOOOOOO 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive  What did we do before 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive I rely on it to stay organized as PhD student with a full time profession and family 
len ratingfive I can access my documents from anywhere as well as save them to my computer 
len ratingtwo  Can t stop notification
len ratingfive  It is awesome it s really easy to work 
len ratingone  I can not buy tb storage there is only one option gb y
len ratingfive Google Drive is getting things done and that s all that matters oh and easily 
len ratingfive  Looks like Google is emerging as the dominant multi mode program when you consider how many applications they have that allows any person to accomplish most every task most people need to perform both personal and business tasks 
len ratingfive I just spent hours reviewing many apps in Google s arsenal and didn t see all of their programs but the ones I did see were solid well thought out easily learned very simple fast to import data from the apps I ve been using forever into their much more useful and helpful set of programs 
len ratingfive It s great to have one app that has many layers of useful apps which all work in unison saving time and many steps it took the old way as I switched from app to app cutting and pasting data from one to another 
len ratingfive Great platform Google

len ratingfive Great platform Google 
len ratingfour Google drive is hands down the most intuitive easy to use cloud storage in the market The only issue I ve noticed is that when you color a file in drive it doesn t show up in someone else s drive as that same color or any color at all 
len ratingfour This would be super useful when collaborating on shared google drive folders
len ratingfive Can send all my files documents pictures etc 
len ratingfive here and never have to worry while on the go 
len ratingfive Available wherever I am 
len ratingfive No glitches no errors and capacity seems to never end 
len ratingfour  The state Wisconsin is called the badger and the dairy state 
len ratingfour The reason Wisconsin is called the dairy state and the badger state is because of the dairy farms and the state animal the badger 
len ratingfive  Love the Google Drive App 
len ratingfive Use it for business when I m travelling or working from home 
len ratingfive They app has not only help my personal life but my business as well 
len ratingfive google and it s apps combined with the iPhone 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive This is the best app on the App Store by light years 
len ratingfive This helps me organize all my internet papers and such 
len ratingfive I cannot believe how effective it is for saving pages of the dark web 
len ratingfive No longer will I lose track of all the children I have found on the World Wide Web 
len ratingone  CONSTANTLY asks to rate after opening a picture 
len ratingfive  Genial
len ratingone  Wouldn t stop asking me for feedback and rating while I was trying to do work 
len ratingone Also failed to load the document anyway 
len ratingone If I say I don t want to rate it stop asking me 
len ratingfive The best application
len ratingone  Y u unsupport dolphin
len ratingfive  I ve been using Google Drive and its related services for several years now and I ve been able to keep hundreds of documents and projects well organized 
len ratingfive With the option to choose different colors for all of the different folders I have it s considerably easier to locate what I need and find the right place to store my files as I create them 
len ratingfive And it s free 
len ratingfive With no ads 
len ratingfive It s probably the best mobile desktop productivity suite out there for so many reasons that I don t have the time to get into 
len ratingfive It s also very nice that people who don t have Google accounts can view the documents you share with them 
len ratingfive I m fairly certain that there are limitations with this function but I can t immediately think of what they are 
len ratingfive I m uncertain what the benefit is of having the Google Docs app separate from the Google Drive app but my only grievance is with the fact that I have to be sent to the Google Docs Sheets or Slides app that can edit the file 
len ratingfive It seems like it would be more efficient and easier on the mobile device to not have to switch apps 
len ratingfive My suggestions for improving the app Allow YouTube videos to be embedded in Docs Sheets and Slides 
len ratingfive  Allow Slides and Sheets to be embedded and interactive editable in Docs 
len ratingfive  This would be so helpful for making presentations and proposals to Boards of Directors 
len ratingfive Allow the option to change the color of the Sheets Slides and Docs icons for easier identification just like you did with the color options for the folders 
len ratingfive Allow Google Drive to open more file types I don t like using third party extensions to open up access files in my Google Drive 
len ratingfive I m not certain if the same group that s working on the Google Drive app is working on the Google Docs Sheets and Slides apps as well but it would be really cool to have the chat function on shared documents always be available and not just when two people are both looking at the same time 
len ratingfive Also it would be cool to integrate video conferencing into Google Docs as well 
len ratingfive I m sure I ll think of more areas for improvement later 
len ratingfive I ll update the review then if I can 
len ratingfive Also Attention everyone involved in Google apps and services for mobile and desktop 
len ratingfive There are many services that you have that are not widely known things like Google Voice Forms Keep Primer Inbox etc 
len ratingfive that need to be more easily discovered 
len ratingfive Maybe you could redesign your app drawer on the various Google desktop sites 
len ratingfive You may want to see which apps can merge and make it less scattered 
len ratingfive There has to be a way for Google Voice and Google Hangouts to be seamlessly integrated I don t know 
len ratingfive Just food for thought 
len ratingfive Anyway thanks for all of your hard work 
len ratingfive It s much appreciated 
len ratingtwo The app is fine i wish you could select multiple files to move or delete simultaneously 
len ratingtwo Its really annoying that it asks me to rate the app everytime i do something 
len ratingtwo Im just trying to get some work done 
len ratingfive  I hope security is on lockdown tho 
len ratingfive It has been free headache and stress for me since this online tool came over to the market thank you very much Developer team I do not have words to say thank you I really appreciate how you make it available and easy to use for us the online world 
len ratingfive  I use it for everything
len ratingone  Unfortunately some google services don t work as well on Apple devices 
len ratingone We all know why 
len ratingfive  If I was still working this would be an amazing tool for me 
len ratingfive Being able to access drawings and spread sheets from a single source across all platforms was unheard of years ago 
len ratingfive But being mostly retired I still use it for pictures and other files that I may want to see on the go or at home on the old pc or laptop 
len ratingfive It s a great app that keeps getting better 
len ratingfour Great for the price of free but I d love the scanning feature from Android
len ratingfive  They did a great job
len ratingfive  This is a great drive with wonderful features 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive  I love it
len ratingfive Thanks it is the best App 
len ratingfive Does a lot and well arranged 
len ratingthree I only rated it because it is really annoying that I cannot edit it 
len ratingthree In order to edit it I have to get other apps 
len ratingthree Otherwise it is good 
len ratingfive Getting value out of using Google Drive unlike Google Home which doesn t connect business Apps 
len ratingfour  Pretty good so far 
len ratingfive  You put something o the drive you can access it from anywhere share with anyone organize it any way you want 
len ratingthree  Bugs
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfive Can t live without it 
len ratingfive So useful so vital not sure how people managed to survive without it in the past decade 
len ratingone  Why in the world would you take out something that already works 
len ratingone If you care what your users think pls bring back passcode lock 
len ratingfive  Good n excelente
len ratingfive  Extremely helpful 
len ratingfive I love the share feature so that everyone can work on a project in real time to complete a task 
len ratingfive Love to connect to my school through this easy to set up app 
len ratingfive  Finally a place to store all my pics and documents 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingfour Affordability for casual users loading speed general UI improvement to name a few 
len ratingfour  Love this service 
len ratingfour Good way to keep all your documents in one place to be accessed from many different devices 
len ratingfour I like how you can create shareable links for videos 
len ratingfour I only wish they would give more free space 
len ratingfive  Being able to access my files from anywhere at anytime is empowering
len ratingthree Still no Google forms editor for mobile 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  Go for it it really works it s always backed up and if you have service you have your files 
len ratingfive Excellent stuff
len ratingfive  It blew me away
len ratingfive Everything you ll ever need for large file storage and sharing 
len ratingone So lame 
len ratingfive  It s a great app
len ratingfive At first I wasn t sure I was going to like this app 
len ratingfive The thing I love most about it is the real time file sharing 
len ratingfive No lag which is wonderful 
len ratingfive I m taking a class online and we use this app a lot to share files to other devices 
len ratingfive You can even upload files from a tablet to a laptop 
len ratingfive  I use this for everything 
len ratingfive It helps so much to store temporary or permanent files 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive  This app is so awesome 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive It is a life saver for me 
len ratingfour All I think should be added is an easy feature that enables you to download images and videos straight to your phone 
len ratingfour It s not as intuitive as it should be 
len ratingthree  Can t really blame apple bc constraint safe areas were we re established before the iPhone ex came out but yeah there are layout issues on the iPhone 
len ratingone Honestly I like it but I don t like how they continuously ask me to review it so here is your review you wanted it so bad 
len ratingone There ya go should have waited till I got use to the app before bugging me every second 
len ratingfour  I can be on vacation or in my classroom 
len ratingfour It makes life easy
len ratingtwo  Becoming very hard to navigate 
len ratingtwo But everyone must remember I ve never worked on a computer in my life 
len ratingtwo I m a real newbie at anything to do with a computer 
len ratingtwo I promise i will get better and the stars will go up 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  I love google dive it is sooo helpful for whatever I need
len ratingfive  Can t survive without it 
len ratingfive  I pay for G Suite 
len ratingfive Excellent value 
len ratingfive I love Google Drives seamless experience along with its google photo sync yay thanks Google 
len ratingfive  I love this app
len ratingone  I m reviewing this app because the app will not stop bothering me in the middle of my workflow 
len ratingone  Review No thanks tryna work Review Uh no 
len ratingone Kinda busy REVIEW 
len ratingone  I dismissed not once not twice not three times but four only to realize that I was in an infinite loop in which I literally could not create a document until I acquiesced to this app s pathological need for flattery and attention 
len ratingone So finally here I am 
len ratingone You are getting what you would not stop asking for 
len ratingone Enjoy 
len ratingone Doing this so google doesn t ask me to review them again
len ratingfive  It has solved my problems of storing important data 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfour  Overall the app does well but it tends to crash when I try to upload photos 
len ratingfive  So helpful
len ratingfive  Thumbs up 
len ratingfive  I was born in the s I love this app 
len ratingfive Thank you for making it easy for me to use 
len ratingfive  This app is great for my school work and is a like saver 
len ratingone  Maybe it s iOS but I view a PDF fine at first but when I tap on it to scroll it turns all black 
len ratingfive  Google docs has things organized and is very efficient 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone  I used to like google drive but they removed the option to lock specific users in the app 
len ratingone Now I have no secure place to hold files I don t want anyone else to access 
len ratingone Not happy at all 
len ratingone Considering deleting the app 
len ratingone  I just refreshed my Inspiron so it would run better yesterday 
len ratingone There s still GB of unwanted files I can t get rid of after hitting Empty Trash several times 
len ratingfour  Just loaded the app onto my iphone and was able to upload a video 
len ratingfour So far so good 
len ratingfour Hoping to successfully share next 
len ratingfive  At first I was a bit skeptical when the company began using google drive and requested that we transition to it over a month period 
len ratingfive The thought of placing all of my business documents on this platform was definitely intimidating 
len ratingfive But I quickly outgrew the fear and I now love it 
len ratingfive Especially when I was in Europe and had to review two proposal for a client that could not wait for me to get back 
len ratingfive The ease just of signing into Google and working as if I was home was truly amazing 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive  I can get to all my files without having to go to my laptop 
len ratingfive Also I can print out from here without having to create a file in Microsoft word or a word processor 
len ratingfive Very very convenient 
len ratingfive  I ve been using Google Drive for around years now and I ve only had positive experiences with it 
len ratingfive I mainly use it as a sort of library now to store various PDFs articles and writings that I want to easily access or share with others 
len ratingfive For the longest time I used it for collaborative spreadsheets to manage data with my peers or to centralize a lot of information into one file that could be easily accessed by others 
len ratingfive It worked well and the best part of it was that it was free 
len ratingfive I d highly recommend this to any college students that want to centralize their course work or notes that do not use iCloud Drive 
len ratingfive I use both for my work and it makes everything so much easier to keep track of and access in an instant if needed 
len ratingfive I ve also used it for my tutoring since I can see the information people are struggling with without having to make time for an appointment 
len ratingfive It enables quick feedback in many different forms 
len ratingfive The possibilities with the tools they provide you with are endless 
len ratingfive This is an app that is definitely worth the download for anyone seeking to improve their productivity and ease of access 
len ratingone  This app is great except that you guys are making me do this review which is why you are getting one star 
len ratingfive  Makes work life so EASYYY
len ratingthree  This app is great however the use of tabs should be included to optimize the work 
len ratingfive simply awesome
len ratingfour I have to go on computer to add any files or folders shared with me to My Drive I wish I can just do it on the phone through the app 
len ratingfour Thx 
len ratingfive  I use it everyday and I don t know how I ever lived without it 
len ratingone I don t know why there were so many pictures and files lost in my google drive 
len ratingone All my recently uploaded were gone I m so sure that nobody can excess my account but me 
len ratingone Upset 
len ratingthree  Multiple times a day while I m typing chrome will show up on the sidebar and I can not continue until it finishes loading and I can make the sidebar close
len ratingfive  Has been great as my retirement option having given up my computer with my 
len ratingfive I can share with family or business associates and friends 
len ratingfive Has been the perfect option
len ratingfour  Great for accessing documents on the go and sharing with others 
len ratingfour They only reason for not rating it five stars is not having full access to all editing functions 
len ratingfour Otherwise great 
len ratingone  The files will not actually upload 
len ratingfive  I love having access to all my files from anywhere even when traveling 
len ratingfive It s easy to transition from the Microsoft Office products to Google 
len ratingfive  I use google drive for all kinds of stuff 
len ratingfive It s so convenient to have access to all my files I need at home and on the go 
len ratingfive I have more data so it s an online backup for family photos and stuff as well 
len ratingfive Huge fan 
len ratingfive I Love google drive it s so easy to use and you don t loose any important files and documents
len ratingone Stop annoying users for feedback
len ratingone Bring passcode Touch ID back 
len ratingfive Helps to organize my business 
len ratingfive  It s really great app it is the part my daily life 
len ratingfive I can access all of my documents on the go can review can edit 
len ratingfive  The Google Drive app has improved steadily over the years that I ve been using it on a daily basis 
len ratingfive Through Drive along with Docs and Sheets I m able to do much of my work on the go where ever I happen to be 
len ratingfive This is a huge benefit to me and one more reason that almost no business should even need to consider Microsoft Office suite 
len ratingfour Please bring that option again as for now its not secured from others 
len ratingfour Anybody can use and access Gdrive while having the phone unlock 
len ratingfour Please bring that option back for this app 
len ratingfour Thank You

len ratingtwo Even if Permission to see and edit was done 
len ratingone  Constantly asking for me to rate it 
len ratingone Pretty annoying 
len ratingone  You lost stars
len ratingfive  Google drive is the next thing the next best thing to having an a personal companion 
len ratingfive It holds everything 
len ratingfive Access whatever you put in there anytime anyplace days of the year 
len ratingfive It s the equivalent of having a file cabinet that you can share content with others and change the content without having to re file 
len ratingfive It just requires that you have minimum organizational skills to keep it all together your way 
len ratingfive You
len ratingone  Keeps crashing 
len ratingfour  Needs to update faster 
len ratingfour Have trouble sometimes finding a file I just renamed 
len ratingone You can t access team drive from here 
len ratingone Apparently it s not supported on iOS at all which makes Drive useless to me 
len ratingone I m not sure why they can do one but not the other 
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingfive Easy to organize share and store across all devices 
len ratingfive  I love this app
len ratingone  Won t ever let me download my videos to my phone 
len ratingone Nothing but glitches and waiting forever to export 
len ratingone Crappy App

len ratingfive The lady who does our Bible Study Broadcast lives in Ohio and I live in Missouri

len ratingone  I plan out this mile drive in Google drive and then I m trying to get it to go to Google Maps and get Google maps to navigate on this route I ve chosen but Google maps is trying to show me the quickest route and or the shortest route 
len ratingone If I wanted that I would ve not have painstakingly plotted out this back roads drive 
len ratingthree  Uploading and downloading work great now if I could just get Drive to display a slideshow of my images 
len ratingfive  GB for free Worth it
len ratingfive  Easy reliable blah blah as it should be
len ratingone  Not cool
len ratingone Newer version doesn t adhere to other google privacy settings 
len ratingone If you intermix your photos with your work documents recent activity will always get overwhelmed by changes to photo uploads

len ratingfive I like how easy it is to Maneuver and how efficient it is with keeping upcwith files
len ratingone Why would you take passcode lock off google drive 
len ratingone This is the main reason I used this app

len ratingfive I use it to store photos from my phone 
len ratingfive I don t have much storage so it s great to be able to keep a back up in case I need to delete a lot of photos 
len ratingfive  It s a must for networking job contacts
len ratingfour I used Google Drive and found it very useful 
len ratingfour It is easy to use and has helped me share large files that normally I would not be able to email 
len ratingone  Can only send links to view documents what good is a file manager if you can t send the actual file 
len ratingfive  As a medical student and entrepreneur I rely on Google Drive to back up my important files and let me access them from anywhere even without my laptop 
len ratingfive Over the last several years this app has gotten better and better 
len ratingfive Docs sink on all of my devices without fail 
len ratingfive This allows me to have so much productivity it s amazing 
len ratingfive Bueno
len ratingone  I don t care for having to save image file sent via gmail to Drive and my I m prompted to write a review at every turn 
len ratingone Huge waste of my time 
len ratingone Something that should be touches and seconds is now a few dozen clicks and a five minute process

len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Very bad condition bicycle 
len ratingone A lot of scratches damages nipple is full broken
len ratingfive  I use google drive docs slides and sheets for most aspects of my education career 
len ratingfive Quite honestly I often wish the suite of tools did some of the deluxe things Office does but for the price tag and easy usability just a login but no software download one really can t beat the seamless integration with my Google life 
len ratingfive Super app 
len ratingfive Posebno sto ima mogu nost postavljanja ifre sto nije slu aj sa android app disc 
len ratingfive Drive like all other Google products is simple 
len ratingfive Simplicity rules 
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingfour  One of the features that I really enjoyed was the PIN number fingerprint id as an added level of security 
len ratingfour Can this feature be restored 
len ratingfive  for everything
len ratingone  Documents were previously editable in this application but now it is simple a viewer 
len ratingone Disappointed that I need apps to perform the functions that this single app previously performed 
len ratingfive  For making it easy and continuing to improve 
len ratingfive Still a lot to update but I ll continue to use you 
len ratingfive Really like the ease and convenience of all of its current features 
len ratingfive In Google Drive Google has produced a mature proven service that I consider to be a cornerstone of the cyber age and a friend in my digital lifestyle 
len ratingfive Google Drive is my go to resource that I know I can call upon to help me manage digital content reliably from anywhere I can connect to the internet 
len ratingfive It is part of an ecosphere of solid wonderfully useful on line services and products that Google has carefully constructed over the years setting the standard for cloud computing and user experience 
len ratingfour  I kind of like the app 
len ratingfour It s just I can only do Chinese 
len ratingfive It makes work easier and helps make a safe place for all of my documents 
len ratingfive  You can take selfie s on here when you re on a computer doing this you can t take selfie s
len ratingfive  One word 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfive  Google Drive makes files organization and document collaboration easy 
len ratingone  I have been trying to find and I movie that I exported to drive earlier and times and I can not find it 
len ratingfive  works well
len ratingthree  The app is great but needs a refresh 
len ratingthree The look is getting a bit dated 
len ratingthree I wish it would it to be faster 
len ratingthree Can t go wrong with a faster and more responsive app 
len ratingthree You guys laid down a great foundation but now what are you guys going to build on it whats next for Google drive

len ratingfour Every time I delete a photo I m asked for a review and the slideshow doesn t continue everything else seems ok 
len ratingfive  La mejor app que existe
len ratingone  I actually like this app 
len ratingone But it asked me five times in a row if I want to review this app when I said no 
len ratingone So here you go 
len ratingone One star 
len ratingtwo Stability is a big issue with most google apps 
len ratingone  Why can t I chromecast 
len ratingfive  Es gratis y tienes asistente y se actualiza sola 
len ratingone Why won t it let me add a account 
len ratingfive  Awesome
len ratingfive  Did I mention that I love this app 
len ratingfive FYI My review of Google Drive must include the suite of apps it contains like Docs Sheets etc 
len ratingfive This Google Product is wonderful 
len ratingfive It provides easy access to Google s entire suite of office applications 
len ratingfive I have found it so much easier to use than the corresponding APPLE apps 
len ratingfive I measure an app s quality based on how intuitive its features are 
len ratingfive I don t want to hunt and hunt for the tools and menus needed to perform basic generic functions 
len ratingfive I don like to read a mountain of tutorials to use oddly placed inadequately labeled tools and menus which I ve found in other apps with the exception of the Microsoft Suite 
len ratingfive The Google menus make sense to me 
len ratingfive The features are well placed and uncluttered 
len ratingfive The icons clearly tell you what they can do and have intuitive drop down menus As evidenced by the fact that I was able to create basic documents and spreadsheets within seconds of opening the app 
len ratingfive And finally help is easy to access when needed 
len ratingfive Oh yes and it s FREE 
len ratingfive PP
len ratingfive  Super user friendly 
len ratingfive The Google apps and Google Drive in particular have made working on things between my phone and desktop computer very easy 
len ratingone I really like this app 
len ratingone I gave it one star because it asked me three times in minutes to rate it while l was trying to use it 
len ratingone So if you force me to give a rating that s what you get 
len ratingfive  As the technical director for a Public Radio station featuring an in studio program I often need to send a show edited at home back to the station for broadcast in wav format 
len ratingfive I find Google Drive to be the easiest and most convenient way to share a hour show at the speed of my internet connection 
len ratingfive Once uploaded to Drive simply tag the contact to whom needs wants it and it appears in their inbox to be downloaded 
len ratingfive What could be easier 
len ratingfive  It s A Great Way To Share My Work With My Teacher
len ratingfive I am the media director at my church so I use Google Drive to transfer all my files between Home and the A V computers at my church 
len ratingfive Have used it successfully for years now problem free 
len ratingfive Makes life simple for my whole team 
len ratingfive I produce everything at home but it is available for whoever is working on my team 
len ratingfive  First time I use it work great
len ratingone  Just installed the latest update for Google Drive 
len ratingone The app crashes every time I try to open it 
len ratingone It no longer works on my iPad 
len ratingfive Audio and video files load faster and playback is uninterrupted by incomplete loading 
len ratingfive  I can easily check in with my students by creating shared folders 
len ratingfive I have my own folders for each class hour I teach and each student has their own shared folder to me 
len ratingfive Every assignment is to be done in this shared folder which I can access on my own screen and communicate via comments without standing over their shoulder 
len ratingfive This gives accountability that students are on task and not hopping to a new browser auto saves their work folders can be shared viewed by parents so parents know if their student is up to date with assignments and gives me the luxury to have a paperless system no more student claims of I turned it in 
len ratingfive Clearly I like Docs as a result of teaching Langage Arts but we use slides and students have their own websites by using sites which we use for facilitating student led conferences 
len ratingfive This helps students be better prepared for future job interviews and practice presentation skills 
len ratingfive The accessibility to view past versions of work is key to know when edits have been made to projects and lets students easily collaborate for group projects 
len ratingfive I am SO GLAD our school has chosen to use Google Drive 
len ratingfive I feel it s the best fit for both teachers and students to interact in this era that combines education and innovation 
len ratingfive I use a paid Google apps g suite account and have unlimited space on my drive 
len ratingfive After spending some time updating my folders Google drive has replaced large hard drives for me and my personal systems remain under gb 
len ratingfive Google s private networks keeps drive super fast all around the world I ve used it quite a bit in India 
len ratingfive App is great 
len ratingfive Easy uploads and integration with files app 
len ratingfive My only change request is to show the computers sidebar item so that I can access files from my desktop while mobile 
len ratingfour  Google Drive is a great service and it is capable of everything that Dropbox can do except some Dropbox features aren t available on iOS for Google drive 
len ratingfour For example Google drive doesn t let you scan documents in iOS but you can scan documents in Android 
len ratingfour Anyway the app s design is nice but I would appreciate a more iOS look 
len ratingfour Also you can t download entire folders offline something I would really love to see 
len ratingfour Collectivity these little things don t matter because I love using google drive and you will too 
len ratingfive  As anything from google works well
len ratingone Crashing on my iOS iphone whenever I open any document picture or even sometimes while using the app and settings 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX 
len ratingfive  The one thing I wish I could do is attach a file as an attachment from Drive to Gmail
len ratingfive  This is the bomb
len ratingfive Don t do anything without it 
len ratingone Google drive never automatically uploads my photos like it s supposed to 
len ratingone And sometimes it misses uploading stuff when I manually make it upload 
len ratingfive Love being able to have my documents available to me anywhere and on any device 
len ratingfive Such a time saver and reliable 
len ratingthree Been using google drive for some time now and every time I upload I see doubles of each pic 
len ratingthree SO Inconvenient having to deleting the copies of each picture and I upload in bulk 
len ratingthree I enjoy the that I have a safe place to put my digital photos but this needs to be fixed 
len ratingthree Any advice on how to fix this 
len ratingthree It s a waste of time am I the only one 
len ratingfive  I m an apple fan but I have to say I love google drive more than my iCloud 
len ratingfive Thanks Google
len ratingfive Great but overly persistent for this review as I am trying to research 
len ratingfive So hopefully this is it 
len ratingone Doesn t let you download videos
len ratingfive I love this
len ratingfive  The question is why you haven t yet 
len ratingfive  I like being able to access files and organize my drive from my phone 
len ratingfive Very intuitive and easy to use 
len ratingfive  Marvalleous 
len ratingtwo Crash every time is gonna be open on iOS on iPhone 
len ratingtwo Hope it will be patched soon 
len ratingone  Disappointing that the passcode fingerprint lock is no longer available
len ratingfive  I found it amazing
len ratingfive  Omg
len ratingone  Started off great but more and more unsolicited file shares from pornographic dating spammers 
len ratingone Hard to believe there isn t a simple way to turn off incoming shares from unknown sources 
len ratingone Google went evil years ago 
len ratingone Too bad 
len ratingfive Drive makes sharing files and working on different computers totally simple
len ratingone  Any app that keeps asking me to review it every seconds no joke 
len ratingone Every time I swipe to view another photo 
len ratingone is Star in my book 
len ratingfive  Thank you for making this drive so easy to use and so dependable 
len ratingone  I don t like being asked for a review every minutes 
len ratingfive  Perhaps when I succeeded in destroying all
len ratingfive I concur with all star ratings for this product 
len ratingfive It has greatly simplified my personal academic and community storage needs with reliable and secure access to all sorts of documents of various file types 
len ratingfive Many thanks
len ratingfive Must have
len ratingfive  Best storage drive I have used 
len ratingthree  I do love google drive EXCEPT I have to really memorize the exact location of every file because the search engine doesn t work Everytime I search something it shows up no items match your search 
len ratingthree Its annoying dropbox seems to work fine but google drive doesn t

len ratingfive  Nice
len ratingfive  I love all their products and drive is one of the best 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingtwo  I really like the ability to have pretty much all my documents that I have in one spot 
len ratingtwo The only problem is the fact that it constantly crashes whenever I look at any document that is approximately pages 
len ratingtwo Fix that and this would be stars 
len ratingone  We were talked into switching to G Suite 
len ratingone I curse it every time I interact with it 
len ratingone More than anything I hate the Google file formats 
len ratingone I hate the latency of getting a view of my calendar on my iPhone iPad et al 
len ratingone I hate the Google mail client interface 
len ratingone But at least we can say we purists 
len ratingone Google search is good 
len ratingthree  I just started using Drive and after looking at it for a few minutes I will give it stars as it looks like something I ll be able to make good use of

len ratingfive Makes life so much easier for me i have a place where i can keep my stuff 
len ratingfive Still learning the tools but overall 
len ratingone  Stop it s a great app from a well known company 
len ratingone This is unnecessary 
len ratingthree Not a great iOS app 
len ratingthree Functional but not obvious how to sort as an example 
len ratingfive Mi mejor experiencia de archivo y organizacion de documentos e imagenes 
len ratingfive For anyone just emerging from a year coma yes google drive is awesome 
len ratingone Constantly asks to be reviewed 
len ratingone Jumps all over the place 
len ratingone It s very slow to access the items you want to see 
len ratingone  I ve lost a couple of videos as if they were low quality 
len ratingfive Without this I would not be able to connect with my team across Florida 
len ratingfive This app has made college so much easier with the multiple folders color coating and mobile app 
len ratingfive I have every semester still in my drive and each class color coordinate to help me quickly identify where I need to go 
len ratingfive  az
len ratingfive  A quick an easy way app to store and retrieve files 
len ratingone The only reason I rated the app so low is I didn t have time to rate it right now and it would keep popping up over and over until I rated this app not letting me skip it for a while 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I have it installed on my iPhone iPad laptop shortcut
len ratingfour The app is good but i would really like to see all the features which google doc has on pc version 
len ratingfive  Best file sharing platform ever
len ratingone  They poped up while I m typing 
len ratingone  Seems pretty pointless to me 
len ratingone Nothing will come up and everything I try says unsupported file 
len ratingone WHAT 
len ratingone I don t understand why passcode lock was removed 
len ratingone I have sensitive files that are now exposed 
len ratingone  This is upsetting
len ratingfour It s grate for schoolwork or or graphs in a group projects 
len ratingfive This app is great for everything in life from school business work 
len ratingfive All the above 
len ratingfive All the important documents you need all in one place 
len ratingfive  Super drive
len ratingtwo  Uploading from phone to shared folder has a really crappy interface 
len ratingtwo Why is it so hard to select the folder which I with to upload 
len ratingfour I like using it 
len ratingfour Would definitely be stars but the took away the passcode security 
len ratingone  Yejdfegdjdhdgdgdudgdhdhhrfhhfjenebfhdnpoop
len ratingtwo Es gibt keine M glichkeit vom Handy aus die Datei auch ins Handy zu speichern 
len ratingfive  Love it

len ratingfive  It s great I just wish we could collaborate 
len ratingfive Google drive allows me to save all my docs and have them at hand every time I need them 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Muy bueno 
len ratingthree  The one squabble I have with Drive is that there is not a direct download button 
len ratingthree You have to go to Send file then select Download 
len ratingthree Since I upload to Drive from my computer just to download again to my phone for posting to social media it would save time and hassle to be able to just click Download and be done 
len ratingthree Otherwise good app 
len ratingone The passcode lock was one of the features that made me want to use this in the first place 
len ratingone I will seam other options without that security 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive  Thanks
len ratingone  At some point in our evolution humans will figure out a way to not have to do any of this crap anymore 
len ratingfive  Best free combo of apps even compared to Microsoft paid ones 
len ratingfive I send small businesses to start using it all the time 
len ratingfive  Enjoying getting my files from device to to device with additional subscriptions
len ratingfive Easy to navigate 
len ratingfive I have access on all my devices 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingone  I no longer love this app cuz they remove the Passcode Lock and Touch ID 
len ratingone Now anyone that barrows your phone can get access to your Google Drive Docs Sheets and Slides
len ratingfive  All the the same features on my phone as on my PC 
len ratingfive Therefore it makes it very convenient 
len ratingfive  V helpful
len ratingfive I m the PTA President and was walking around with a thumb drive until I used this

len ratingfive  Wonderful App 
len ratingfive Easy to figure your way through it 
len ratingfive Everything is in one place 
len ratingfive User friendly
len ratingfive  Really handy
len ratingone  The storage used by google photos caused me to not have access to gmail for over months 
len ratingone I finally broke down and had to purchase storage just so I could use my gmail

len ratingone Tots fail google
len ratingfive  My husband and I use Drive for each of our companies and at home to manage anything from purchase orders donations he s in non profit to shopping lists and printer ink reminders 
len ratingfive Great tool to use mobile 
len ratingone You ask me to rate the app after every single document I close even though I say not now

len ratingfive Can I have favorites or shortcuts to get into folders of my choice

len ratingfive If you re looking to be able to use your phone or iPad more like a computer Drive will definitely help you do that 
len ratingfive  This app is so great if your teacher gives you a lot of assignments on websites
len ratingfive  I am a new user of Google drive but my grad class uses it exclusively so I learned to use it and am really enjoying analyzing data and making graphs 
len ratingfive  Easy layout great sync
len ratingone  Google has deleted passcode Face ID and Touch ID making this app very unsecured 
len ratingone Thanks for the warning and no other options 
len ratingone I m deleting and using MS products and Dropbox 
len ratingfive  The best way to store your data anywhere for everywhere 
len ratingfour Unless I m missing it would love to be able to copy and paste into another folder 
len ratingfour I m using this app on my iPad pro so maybe the desktop has this option 
len ratingfive I ve used Google Drive for years mostly on computers 
len ratingfive Today wanted a document when I only have my smart phone and access was easy as pie 
len ratingfive Everything in one place 
len ratingfive Easy to use yet has great privacy options 
len ratingone  Rated one star for constant review nagging 
len ratingone Here you go 
len ratingone The rest of the product is okay 
len ratingtwo  Every seconds it pops up asking me to review 
len ratingtwo I keep saying not now 
len ratingtwo You happy now 
len ratingfive Very convenient to save something on your computer and open it on the drive app on my phone and iPad to study while waiting in line walking around etc 
len ratingfive  Google drive has provided me with a stable platform to store and share large files 
len ratingfive Better than the competition 
len ratingfive  It s great to have access and even get the notifications that people have shared docs 
len ratingfive So many useful ways to have docs shared 
len ratingfive Great app for on the go 
len ratingfive Use this app all the time for work and personal files 
len ratingfive Great app and very functional 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive  Hot chocolate
len ratingthree I d give it stars but the nagging is super annoying 
len ratingfive  I can look up stuff 
len ratingfour  Everything is ok but bring back the passcode also make a select all and download button so we don t have to go through all of them individually to re download them
len ratingfive  This is the best 
len ratingone  I am not enjoying Google Drive right now because this is not connected to my Google drive at school 
len ratingone If you can do that please tell me and I would enjoy this app much better 
len ratingfive  Easy to used I love it
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive Use it 
len ratingfive For almost everything 
len ratingthree  Please put back the passcode lock feature 
len ratingthree This was a very important for me and I m sure others as well 
len ratingthree I will unlock my phone for other users to use the phone or surf the internet 
len ratingthree But I don t want them accessing other apps on my phone especially Google Drive 
len ratingfive I converted my world from Microsoft Office and Outlook to Google a few years ago and have never looked back 
len ratingfive Everything is so simple and well designed 
len ratingtwo  Why on earth would anyone think it s a good idea to remove the passcode option for Drive 
len ratingtwo Who cares if you have fingerprint ID 
len ratingtwo Did Google ever think that someone may have items of a sensitive nature in their drive that once their phone is unlocked it becomes vulnerable 
len ratingtwo Put the passcode back on and stop trying to decide what s best for us 
len ratingtwo Let the consumer body do that
len ratingone Crashes all the time
len ratingfive Every one thinks I am super woman since I always remember everything no trust me with I don t 
len ratingfive But 
len ratingfive I have access to my GoogleDrive so that is my secret knowledge 
len ratingfive It is just the BEST thing my god child set up for me

len ratingfive  I love it my family loves it our businesses love it 
len ratingfive Gotta love Google Drive Docs Sheets Apps 
len ratingfive It is the Microsoft Office in the cloud that I actually use everyday and across many platforms

len ratingfive  Great to use everyday 
len ratingfive  Excelente plataforma para guardar y compartir data sin importar el tama o del archivo 
len ratingfive  Recomendado 
len ratingfive  I am simply amazed a little late to get on board but delighted I m here 
len ratingfour  Not the easiest to use
len ratingfour  Aunque pocas veces presenta fallas de comunicaci n con la nube
len ratingthree I wish that it had more small features especially on the app like double spacing on documents 
len ratingthree Things like that are important Google 
len ratingone  Not help full
len ratingfive  Can t express how good it is it s a must have app
len ratingfive  Love google drive 
len ratingfive And i use it for everything please don t get rid of it google 
len ratingfive  I am extremely thankful for this App

len ratingfour Please 
len ratingfour Give us an option to upload in jpg instead of the original HEIC photos 
len ratingone Upload the file get an error each time 
len ratingfour I would have to say so far I like google drive 
len ratingfour The thing that would make it even better if they can integrate google keep google calendar doc slide sheet etc 
len ratingfour this will be a big competitor sized up against Apple iCloud 
len ratingfour Hopefully they can make it more like iCloud this will be more helpful for all users 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingone  The third time in seconds that the pop up asked if I wanted to rate the program it earned itself a star review 
len ratingfive  it works well and is able to be organized easily 
len ratingfive noice
len ratingtwo  It doesn t let me type on my slideshow 
len ratingfive Pretty Good 
len ratingfive Found this UsefuL

len ratingfive I use it everyday in my classroom 
len ratingfive I truly LOVE it 
len ratingthree  I can t find my home work for 
len ratingfive This app has been very helpful in keeping organization for clients 
len ratingfive  I use this with my students and it makes my life so much easier 
len ratingfive  It is a very effective and a very good tool for us to have very well made 
len ratingfour  There s a bug when previewing video in drive where you can t back out to a list view

len ratingfour Works perfectly of the time 
len ratingfour Problem there s no way to jump to a page in long document 
len ratingfour If I m reading a page PDF there s no way to jump to the middle except to scroll for minutes 
len ratingfour This choice is insane 
len ratingfour No excuse for it 
len ratingfour Also It would be really really really awesome to save entire folders off line instead of having to do it file by file 
len ratingfour Come on Google this would not be hard 
len ratingfive Thanks for your app google 
len ratingfive It works pretty good on my cellphone 
len ratingfive This is something you need and great to have
len ratingfive  I use this a lot in school
len ratingfive  Starwow
len ratingfive  Love
len ratingfive A rare Swanson recommendation 
len ratingfive That is all 
len ratingfive  So far so good 
len ratingfive  Drive has been such a big help with backing up my pictures to very important documents for school and other stuff as well 
len ratingfive Being able to have google drive on all you devices makes it a great way to have access to your files 
len ratingfive It s also great way to share files with people no matter what type of device they are on 
len ratingfive  I am very happy with their app and storage
len ratingone  Now all my client data is locked they are not helpful in getting anything resolved 
len ratingone Really devastating 
len ratingfive  This is a great place to store my stuff from anywhere
len ratingfive  easy to use uncomplicated change between multiple accounts 
len ratingfive Superduperfragilistic
len ratingfive  Great app for synching files 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive It keeps me connected 
len ratingfive  K so I love this app 
len ratingfive  Great product 
len ratingfive I can t believe it is free 
len ratingfive By far the best document thing ever 
len ratingfive An only downside is that you have to download more free stuff 
len ratingfive They should make a bundle or something 
len ratingfive  Free g of storage saves my life in college 
len ratingfive The drive app is very clean and so far I have had no issues 
len ratingfive  This is one of the best apps you could save your documents and when you change your phone you have it as in your old one 
len ratingone  Very annoying
len ratingtwo  Good app wish more space was free other than that find away to connect my videos to YouTube then y all might get five stArs 
len ratingtwo Excellent app btw
len ratingfive  There is not enough time in a day to describe how useful this has been for me as an independent contractor team leader and father 
len ratingfive This app helps me manage every aspect of my digital life 
len ratingfive Google rocks 
len ratingone  Es muy lento
len ratingfive Thank google for this application it s helpful and useful for keeping all documents I need
len ratingfive Easy to use and a perfect amount of space for free 
len ratingfive Thanks google drive
len ratingfive I could not do all of my work and coordinate all the projects that I work on without the use of Google Drive Sheets Docs and Photos and the ability to share with anyone 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive  Extremely helpful 
len ratingfive  I use Google Drive for everything 
len ratingfive Easy to share and organize 
len ratingfive  I love it 
len ratingfive I have every document with me at all times 
len ratingfive  Thank you Google for providing a drive that is a central location for me to access my files wherever I am 
len ratingfour Good and easy to use I d like if it had a way to download and listen to audio
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfive Huella Nortena
len ratingfive Would be great if the Audio files store do the Drive could be played in a sequence similar to how they would on a music player app 
len ratingfive  This app is the best thing since the birth of Jesus
len ratingfive  I can view files stored in my Drive on my phone computer and tablet any time I want 
len ratingone  Great app except you took away the passcode option 
len ratingone Don t like that anyone friends family kids has access to my files if they are using my phone 
len ratingone  I haven t even gotten a chance to figure out this app and I keep getting prompts to rate it 
len ratingone Thus far I couldn t figure out how to exit videos after viewing them 
len ratingfive I may have just landed a new career because of drive 
len ratingfive I only had a few moments to speak with a potential employer and if it wasn t for how quick I could send her my resume with a cover letter I may have missed out on a different future 
len ratingfive Drive has streamlined it s features with ease and usability 
len ratingfive It enabled me to use the share feature which prompted the option to send it with a message 
len ratingfive This all only took me seconds 
len ratingfive This is one of the many versatile features drive comes with 
len ratingfive Don t take my word for it 
len ratingfive Download it now 
len ratingfive Play with it 
len ratingfive See for your self 
len ratingfive Have a blessed day 
len ratingfive  This app is an Intercal part of my daily communications with clients 
len ratingfive It simplifies storage and retrieval on demand no matter what device I use 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Uploading vedeos from my security camera 
len ratingfive Google is the best 
len ratingfive Plain and simple 
len ratingfive  The fog ghhhbgghgcc ddfghuukm bv ct
len ratingfive Gh
len ratingfive I like this much better than Dropbox I ve had issues with file size loading on Dropbox and they want you to pay for any meaningful data storage size 
len ratingfive  Muit ssimo bom
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive  If only all technology and all apps worked this well 
len ratingfive  Great 
len ratingone would prefer to be able to edit files directly in drive as opposed to downloading separate apps for docs and sheets
len ratingtwo Very convenient for storing data 
len ratingtwo I use it mostly for streaming stored audio 
len ratingtwo Recently there is a glitch where the audio that loses connection 
len ratingfive Great File System accessible anywhere
len ratingfive  Excellent app very handy to store files as a back up and collaborate with friends 
len ratingfive I like to store my favorite photos from the year in a separate folder not on social media or save to disk somewhere as I ve had a few computers go down and lost some pretty precious pictures 
len ratingfive It s great to have a free cloud service at GB or wherever it is set at 
len ratingfive  Most easy sharing great access anywhere 
len ratingfive  Google Drive for iOS works as well as I hoped providing complete access to my Google Drive 
len ratingfive Very convenient
len ratingone  Trying to open a password protected file gives an error on mobile 
len ratingone There is no option to enter the password 
len ratingone Very frustrating and renders the app useless for me 
len ratingfour I like Drive a lot but it needs the way to add a additional password s on individual files folders 
len ratingfour It would be nice if those passwords could also be made to function when sharing files 
len ratingfour It worries me that if someone ever got my google password they would have access to all my files 
len ratingfive  Really like having everything in one place and be able to access it anywhere 
len ratingone It was a pain to turn off video
len ratingone  This by far has to be one of the worst apps in Apple App Google Play stores 
len ratingone Not only do they block your access in which one pays for but they have worked in conjunction with third party apps to hack all accounts and devices to take advantage of the end user and exploit them in various forms of media and not reimbursing the exploitation or damage done by their actions 
len ratingone Furthermore they make excuses and further harm rather than giving proper instructions on the system they destroyed 
len ratingthree I feel it s not dumbfriendly enough 
len ratingfive  I recommend it 
len ratingtwo I don t know how to recover my account and don t know how to get help from google I tried then switched to IOS
len ratingone One star google Removed the passcode lock on its latest update 
len ratingone Very stupid move 
len ratingone Although my device uses a passcode lock it s nice to know that my google drive also had one 
len ratingone VERY STUPID MOVE GOOGLE 
len ratingfive  Excellent indispensable and most satiating source of knowledge pleasure and enjoyment refreshing sweet memories
len ratingtwo  First let me say I do like Google drive 
len ratingtwo I use it on my computer and Android phone with no problem 
len ratingtwo This iOS version keeps crashing when I listen to audio files and the skip s buttons almost never work 
len ratingtwo Also dragging the marker in the app to skip around audio files rarely works 
len ratingtwo It s a good idea well executed everywhere except iOS
len ratingfour  Being able to create tests and send through email is one of the best things ever 
len ratingfour There should be an option and app for it 
len ratingfive  Just as good as the web client even lets you export or store things offline 
len ratingone Removing the passcode lock Touch ID was a huge let down 
len ratingone I wanna revert back to the old version 
len ratingone That s all I have to say 
len ratingfive It s a great app
len ratingtwo Unacceptably slow simple as that 
len ratingthree  I believe it is called the scrub bar 
len ratingthree It is very difficult to tap and drag to a desired playback point on audio files 
len ratingthree It would be fantastic to have additional fast fwd or rw options on the mobile google drive app for iOS 
len ratingthree Not sure if it is Apple s responsibility or Google s 
len ratingthree Just so we are clear i m with no vision problems and work for a major IT company lol 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone  Update STOPPED HIJACKING FOR A FEW DAYS BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THIS RELEASE 
len ratingone  Update STILL HIJACKING FILE OPENING IN FILES APP 
len ratingone Update The app has not been fixed with the latest update and there is nowhere at Google to report bugs 
len ratingone An awful product 
len ratingone Original review Had to delete this app due to its bad behavior 
len ratingone Nasty bug 
len ratingone  I m sorry to hear about your frustration 
len ratingone We re aware of the files app feedback from our users and are looking into possible solutions 
len ratingone Thank you for your review 
len ratingfive  With great ease I have access to all my heavy documents files video clips and photographs 
len ratingfive It has made my life easy 
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingone  Annoyed me constantly to rate it so there 
len ratingfive  Great to have files at my fingertips 
len ratingfour  Google drive app has been crashing ever since I updated my iPhone to it s back working 
len ratingtwo  main app for google drive is updated but nothing else 
len ratingtwo pages slides and gmail still don t take advantage of add space 
len ratingfive would like integration of sheets and docs inside it 
len ratingfive Don t want to install multiple apps on my phone which is already spaced out
len ratingfive  Hi I love this app
len ratingfive I m really pleased with the ease of use in this app 
len ratingfive I use it daily and it s been so helpful for my projects 
len ratingfive  Everything in one place no matter where I am 
len ratingfive What could be better 
len ratingfive Loads quickly and I can print easily to any printer 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingthree  This app is fairly useful though the format is a little strange I can see what they were going for 
len ratingone If you type or delete something the keyboard is delayed and after you type like seconds later the word shows up and vice versa for deleting this app works horribly and I do not recommend it unless you would like to waste your time
len ratingone  I I ve donated Intellectual property and improved Cloud computing data transmission to save hundreds of millions if not billions for the corporation 
len ratingone Plus don t you realize how much potential drive has for building a social network 
len ratingone Get me a job with Google part time and product development and I ll be sure to take the best of Drive and and create something your hangouts was never able to do 
len ratingfour  it crashes all the time which is annoying but it really holds everything my phone cant 
len ratingfour  would use again
len ratingfive Awesome way to organize data 
len ratingfive I can view the files I make on my computer and I can then just screen shot or save the photos so I can have them in my phones files 
len ratingfive Overall very easy and helpful 
len ratingfive  I LOVE SAVING MY WORKS ON THIS APPLICATION AND ITS JUST A GRAND OL TIME thank you and god bless canada
len ratingtwo The eternal problems of google apps 
len ratingtwo This time is drive 
len ratingtwo Seems like it would take ever for google to add an option to clear cache 
len ratingtwo like for example DROPBOX app 
len ratingtwo  Google Drive is a really good iCloud storage service but it does have one significant flaw it does not work with the new drag drop feature in iOS 
len ratingtwo So while I still use it I save my files in documents by Readdle and then synchronize folders with Google drive 
len ratingtwo This actually really surprises me being that Google is typically out in the lead on this sort of thing 
len ratingfive  Google is the absolute best overall most reliable and useful in a real world way 
len ratingfive Also most easy to learn 
len ratingfive  I m a college student and I love being able to upload things into my cloud 
len ratingfive  Very useful app
len ratingthree  Ever since they removed the feature to lock the google apps I give it a from a security is always key
len ratingfive This is good because you can storage your files whenever you want 
len ratingfive Thanks Google for freeing my mind of anxiety over my files 
len ratingfive And for free too 
len ratingfive Like
len ratingfive  Ya
len ratingone Not trying to update to iOS thank you 
len ratingone The new update crashes a lot something which almost never used to happen 
len ratingone  AirPlay DOES NOT work with my iPhone or iPad 
len ratingone Trying to get OUT of full screen mode is not easy control do not respond 
len ratingfive  Superb app to store photos and videos etc 
len ratingfive  App in the world 
len ratingfour  Simple de usar 
len ratingone  All I want to do is share a few pictures so I can add them to an email 
len ratingone So incredibly frustrating 
len ratingfive  good
len ratingfive We love google drive at my school because it is so easy to share and be accessible to not only your work but your coworkers as well 
len ratingfive It makes it easy to share compare and learn 
len ratingone I m annoyed
len ratingfive Its bootiful
len ratingone  Please bring back support for locking with Touch ID 
len ratingfive  I have it on my tablet and my computer don t work so this is so helpful to have other than the fact that you need to download other apps
len ratingfive Drive continues to impress me with how accessible and workable it is across platforms and file types 
len ratingfive I recommend it to anyone and everyone 
len ratingfive My business depends on Google Drive 
len ratingfive It is very user friendly word from sharing documents to creating documents to uploading documents no other app is nearly as efficient 
len ratingfive  Great aide 
len ratingone  Worst app for iPad 
len ratingone Cannot drag and drop files 
len ratingone Loading my drive or shared folders only loads half the items at first requiring me to refresh right after opening 
len ratingone Doesn t work well in split screen 
len ratingone Some shared folders refuse to show up on the shared with me page forcing me to go back and find the link 
len ratingone No option to view docs if I want to view one doc here and edit another in the docs app 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingtwo  I m using my iphone as my pc 
len ratingtwo Still trying to use google dr as my new drive 
len ratingtwo Learning 
len ratingone  App asked me to rate i t times in under minutes 
len ratingone Badgering me to rate your app is a way to get star 
len ratingone  Know what annoys me 
len ratingone An app that refuses to accept the fact I don t want to rate it 
len ratingone Constantly popping up a rating prompt very few minutes is the quickest way to get a Star 
len ratingone Stop it 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive It is soooo convenient and user friendly 
len ratingfive I can t believe I ve lived my life without it 
len ratingfive I no longer have to worry about a USB or losing it 
len ratingfive Everything is in the palm of my hand I just love it

len ratingfive I use it at school and at home 
len ratingfive I like it a lot 
len ratingfive I hope you like it as well 
len ratingfive It is really useful 
len ratingfive Enjoy an awesome app 
len ratingfive  Everything easily in one place 
len ratingfive We use Google Drive for all of our paperwork for the Flori Bama Small Breed Rescue and couldn t be happier 
len ratingfive  Okay 
len ratingfive I could write forever about Google Drive

len ratingfive Amazing easy to use
len ratingfive  Hello all as I am sure everyone reading this knows that there are lots of services that allow you to store files up online and some of them have been around for many years even before the fancy term of The Cloud became popular 
len ratingfive Anyway currently the Big Three Cloud storage services are iCloud by Apple aka Macintosh One Drive originally called Sky Drive by Microsoft Google Drive Of the three in my opinion the best is Google Drive for several reasons 
len ratingfive Both iCloud and One Drive are TOO restrictive limiting what you can put up on there storage drives 
len ratingfive Also Microsoft s One Drive especially early on worked very poorly 
len ratingfive Now you would think that something written by the SAME company that writes the operating system that it was designed to run on would be flawless but that is not the case 
len ratingfive Also Google Drive works perfectly on many different platforms so I always have access to my files no matter what device I am using 
len ratingfive And Google Drive is much more user friendly 
len ratingfive So bottom line is 
len ratingfive I highly recommend Google Drive smile 
len ratingfour  I use it in my work as a teacher 
len ratingfour And for my delay work like the bills and older pictures 
len ratingfour I m very grateful for this apps And I suggest that they give us more space 
len ratingthree  This app is definitely a big help but it s still difficult for none regular users 
len ratingthree Live hints would be nice 
len ratingtwo  I wish u could delete a lot at one time not just deleting a photo one by one
len ratingfive Nice 
len ratingfive Now I can read textbooks using my phone 
len ratingone This is the second time that I ve lost files while trying to move them from a shared file to my drive 
len ratingone These are files that are irreplaceable student performances that vanish into the Ethernet 
len ratingone Not happy 
len ratingtwo  A two star only because it kept on asking me to rate the app every time I made a new folder 
len ratingtwo The OneDrive app doesn t do that 
len ratingfive  Very helpful and easy to use 
len ratingfive I write notes everyday on my school laptop and this app makes it easy to review them on my phone or home computer 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Also a great way to free space on you phone 
len ratingfive  Me gusta
len ratingthree I love the cost saving features but find it difficult to use at times 
len ratingthree Right now I need to up load about photos from iPhone to Drive 
len ratingthree It requires me to select them at a time 
len ratingfive  Best app for storage Flyers videos photos and plus
len ratingfive When sync is processing alot of files it does not allow an individual file to be synced 
len ratingfive This is a problem when working across a network 
len ratingfive  Just love it
len ratingtwo  You need all of the google apps to make new projects sheets EX I wanted to make a google doc so I tapped new and it immediately took me to the App Store and said I need to get google docs to make a doc why do you need drive if you need to get all of the other google apps I can just get google docs and don t have to get all of those apps wasting my storage 
len ratingfive  Wonderful and reliable app gets the job done
len ratingfive  Great tool and very helpful for storing documents on your phone or storing things that take up too much space 
len ratingthree It s a nice app but unfortunately I can only rate it three stars because it takes forever to load my photos in Google Photos 
len ratingthree Improve this and I ll rate five stars 
len ratingfive  Very comforting zone to know that Drive is were I can keep and organize all my cherished storage files 
len ratingfive It is there when I need it compact and ready when I search for any file I keep in Drive 
len ratingfive I m sticking to Drive 
len ratingfive  helpful
len ratingone Tried to open PDF files and they wouldn t open 
len ratingone Other files not recognized would not open 
len ratingone Not a dependable way to store my files 
len ratingone I will continue to use the dependable Dropbox for my files 
len ratingone  Yes
len ratingone  Seriously 
len ratingone What possible motivation could there be for removing the ability to lock google drive independently from your phone 
len ratingone Re enable google drive specific passcode
len ratingfive  Google drive allows me to organize my documents and easily share them 
len ratingfive It simplifies my life 
len ratingfive Amazing app that allows access via all my devices 
len ratingfive I use it constantly 
len ratingfive Simple and easy 
len ratingfive Similar enough to the desktop version 
len ratingfive No complaints so far 
len ratingone It won t load load
len ratingfive This is a great app to keep all your files organized business personal and all you ever need 
len ratingfive Also very easy to share large files with others 
len ratingfour Works well editing word documents is a bit buggy
len ratingfive  Google drive is awesome and better than any thing Apple has ever done 
len ratingfive  It makes accessing notes school work and projects times easier
len ratingfive You can share documents with other gmail users and save everything here 
len ratingfive The great thing is that everything saves automatically you don t have to click a save button like in the Microsoft office app 
len ratingthree  It s nice and really helpful
len ratingfive  No bugs
len ratingfive  Works great
len ratingfive  Nice for storing things from the internet
len ratingone Extremely disappointed that you can not password pin face I d lock the app anymore 
len ratingone Every app I use that may contain confidential information like bills or banking allows for it but Google drive which can also be used to store the same stuff can not be secured anymore 
len ratingone I m disappointed Google 
len ratingone Was a five star app but simply cannot be anymore 
len ratingone BTW I m a paying user to have gb but the security issue cannot be ignored 
len ratingone I have no other choice but to find a different app 
len ratingfive  Excellent 
len ratingfive You can also make your files available offline which is awesome 
len ratingfive  Very useful
len ratingfive Great and productive app 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingone  Don t like it
len ratingfive Drive es una herramienta de trabajo imprescindible para el manejo eficiente de mis documentos de trabajo 
len ratingfive Facilita adem s el intercambio de contenidos y el trabajo en equipo 
len ratingone  I don t know why I keep getting notifications for sex from women I have never met 
len ratingfive This is a excellent application because I can keep all photos pictures and videos
len ratingfive  I use Google Drive to keep me organized with my weekly workout files that my coach sends me 
len ratingfive I save each file by week with dates and I can use it to go back and review 
len ratingfive Probably too much 
len ratingone please
len ratingfive  As a film maker this app makes it really easy to collaborate with fellow filmmakers long distance

len ratingfive It made so simple to store and share my pictures 
len ratingfive  I love this app for sharing with colleagues with relative ease 
len ratingone Updating my review dropping from stars to due to Google removing the passcode lock 
len ratingone I don t care how good the app is if I can t secure my files behind a passcode then it s completely useless to me 
len ratingfour  Great app but gave it four stars because it can t open every file I add but I still recommend it to everyone wanting to use it 
len ratingfive Love all Google products 
len ratingfive Works absolutely almost perfect 
len ratingfive And recommend to those that want all your information available all the time no matter what device you have 
len ratingfive  Indeed this app s exhausting convenience and unrelenting ease of use leave me feeling like the app is waiting for me to load 
len ratingfive  with some razzle dazzle 
len ratingfour  Wish it would play audio video files in a folder or anywhere continuously like an audio video player instead of swiping through the files to play the next one

len ratingfive  It is very good to update all together
len ratingfive  Lucy in the sky with diamonds

len ratingfour  We are using Google Business Services for a start up Corp across the whole Google product line 
len ratingfour Connecting in house and external companies resources people internationally 
len ratingfour We love the features 
len ratingfour The drive is still clunky to use 
len ratingfour It is difficult to move files around up and down hierarchy branches 
len ratingfour Not clear if files are copies or aliases 
len ratingfour We have found it is easier to download then upload a file to move it around which is probably the least efficient for file system management 
len ratingfour Generally it keeps getting better 
len ratingfive  Title speaks for itself
len ratingfive  Exceptional
len ratingthree PDFs opened on this app are blank but fine from desktop 
len ratingthree  I would like to get the passcode option back as I like to keep important documents on there it was great when I had the option to do so

len ratingfive  Uh bip Luckily khinlinj Bono was hibihup Populah pu milky looks ok pull nup itself bob has you he Bjornebihibupbiinuiupjijijyobunhlihu
len ratingfive  Exactly what it says on the tin and of the quality expected of Google 
len ratingfive  This is the perfect cloud app
len ratingfive Loving the drive 
len ratingfive It s been great to share photos on the go with friends and family 
len ratingfive  Started with a few people saying try google drive 
len ratingfive Its been the workhorse for our business as it grows 
len ratingfive Having files in the cloud allows us to successfully run a tree services business with everything at our fingertips 
len ratingfive Its been a great beginning to cloud access 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Good job Google
len ratingfive  This app is so efficient and amazing and makes daily things much easier
len ratingthree  times when you re listening to a song in the background the app will crash and you ll have to go back to the song and restart it 
len ratingthree extremely annoying
len ratingfour  The app is great 
len ratingfour Being able to transfer files from your computer to your iPhone or to your iPad is very helpful but the file format does not carry over exactly the way I have it on the computer 
len ratingfour For instance the highlighted text that I have on the computer only shows up on certain portions of the text that was uploaded to Drive 
len ratingfive  Great app use it daily no complaints 
len ratingfive I love google drive because when I have an assignment and I have to go to dance I cannot bring my laptop 
len ratingfive And when I get to dance I can just go into my phone and do my assignments that my teacher has given me 
len ratingone  It does not work 
len ratingone  App always crashing and freezing when trying to view slideshows
len ratingfive  Thank you
len ratingfive  This is a great storage a safe place that if I am working on google want to access anything or if working with somebody want to share or collaborate google has a place to save it 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive I use the drive for everything 
len ratingfive No more USB for me 
len ratingfive This app is easier to access than my computer 
len ratingfive I have to wait a few seconds for it to open and become available when using my computer but everything is ready to go when I open it from my phone 
len ratingfive Definitely recommend 
len ratingfive Many times the I can t find the folder and have to open another one 
len ratingfive  The app is good to quick access your google dive things and you Don t have to sigh in so it is very convenient
len ratingtwo Very difficult to navigate excel sheet
len ratingfive  Thank you for the extra storage it s great 
len ratingfive A lot of help with school work at home
len ratingfive A great and fantastic product 
len ratingfive If ur cloud is full this is the answer 
len ratingfive Easy to use from ur iPad 
len ratingfive Recommended 
len ratingtwo  Whenever playing media specifically mp files the app crashes 
len ratingtwo I really rely on playing music from this app 
len ratingtwo Will rate stars once it s fixed 
len ratingtwo Other than that there are no other problems but please address the crashing 
len ratingtwo  iPhone Plus
len ratingfive One of these days basic features will get added 
len ratingfive It is cuwl 
len ratingthree  Wish you could multi select images to download on mobile 
len ratingthree I would have rated it a four or a five but every time I did something it was asking me for a rating so I dropped it down to a three 
len ratingthree Otherwise it works fine 
len ratingfive Best App ever 
len ratingthree Drive is nice 
len ratingthree However I have been prompted many times that it is full and I have the option to BUY more storage 
len ratingthree As a teacher trying to save money any way I can for my classroom This bothers me 
len ratingthree Google should offer teachers MORE storage without a price tag over it 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfour But how secure is it 
len ratingone  Really overbearingly annoying
len ratingfive  Enough said 
len ratingthree I spent a lot of time putting descriptions on all my files on my computer but the app has no way of viewing it
len ratingfour I wish the date was also labeled as Apple production of pic taken have been 
len ratingfour Also of location if the choice was available 
len ratingfive It s Perfect 
len ratingfive  This platform is intuitive and professional enough to be used by both my grade school child as a standard for her class and for my use as a researcher
len ratingfive What would the world do with out google 
len ratingtwo  The most recent update keeps crashing a few minutes after I start playing my audiobooks 
len ratingtwo It hasn t done it while I ve got the app screen open but if the screen locks the app closes crashes 
len ratingfive  Whether I want to keep a document private or share it with others google docs sheets slides allows me view it on any device anywhere 
len ratingfive Even if I want to share a picture or video or song Google drive lets me do that 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive  Easy to use 
len ratingfive I store all my photos on here 
len ratingfive It s simple and works well 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone  When I m listening to my audio files off app it ll crash 
len ratingone After like a second list 
len ratingone I thought updates were supposed to fix the problems when I first I got it there wasn t a single problem a couple months and updates later it just crashes on me 
len ratingone To the point where I actually had to write a review please fix this problem 
len ratingfive  A place where you have your photos save 
len ratingfive It s better than iCloud 
len ratingfive Awesome job google 
len ratingfour It does most everything I need an online drive to do and it syncs things a little more cleanly without double creating some folders and other shenanigans like you would see in OneDrive 
len ratingfour Only two issues I ve had thus far is that Sheets can t open a synced xlsx file even as a read only 
len ratingfour Other is the interaction between google photos google drive my computer s photos and my phones photos can get kinda wonky with how things get saved but I guess there s only so much it can do with that many different places syncing photos
len ratingfour  Good but can better
len ratingthree It is good but to create a google docs you need to download a second app easier on computer
len ratingone  They removed passcode lock 
len ratingone Since this was for secure files they made this app useless 
len ratingone When they fix this huge mistake I ll fix my rating 
len ratingfive It is so very helpful 
len ratingfive Especially when I m at my last resort on how to send a document 
len ratingfive Also sharing a document has been a very tremendous asset as well 
len ratingfive Hats of to Drive 
len ratingfive As CEO of My Label and Production Company Blvck Universe LLC 
len ratingfive Me and my family must say Thank You google and the drive for this wonderful app that helps us do and manage so much for the success building our company 
len ratingfive  Chad Ali 
len ratingfive Uploads videos quite quickly 
len ratingfive I recommend this app if you want to send videos and are too big to put into emails 
len ratingfive  Very clean and reliable 
len ratingfive  Gives you fluidity 
len ratingfive  This is a full featured productivity suite 
len ratingfive When I use it from my desktop it has the horsepower and feature set to provide the tricks I want 
len ratingfive On my smartphone where I use it most of the time everything is there uncluttered and it works seamlessly with the desktop 
len ratingtwo  Trying to save videos from drive to my iPhone but the app doesn t seem to be working 
len ratingfive I m just trying this for the first time 
len ratingfive My only problem is I have the iPhone c which doesn t have a lot of memory 
len ratingfive So when memory is low I have to delete apps 
len ratingfive I don t know if this app uses memory but I ll find out 
len ratingfive Im also disappointed that I had to write a review before using this app a few times on order to get out of you request to rate it then ask for a review 
len ratingfive Doesn t seem right to ask me when it s the first time I ve used it 
len ratingfive Of course if anything is going to go wrong with it you wouldn t ask me to rate the app and give a review then 
len ratingfive Just saying 
len ratingfive  Google drive is easy to use reliable and a great way to save important files 
len ratingfive Google drive recently restored all my files when I was forced to buy a new cell phone 
len ratingfive All my pictures and contacts were restored in a matter of minutes 
len ratingfive Thanks to Google Drive 
len ratingfive  It s a nice way to transport my files from one device to another

len ratingfive I no longer have to go upstairs to get my computer 
len ratingfive I always have my phone with me so now that I have this app it makes it easier to get my work done 
len ratingfive I have no concerns with this app 
len ratingfive It may look different than the computer version but it is still perfect to finish work on 
len ratingfive No crashes great app 
len ratingfour  So I Just Got This And I Thought It Was Great But 
len ratingfour It Wasn t 
len ratingfour I Was Looking For Google Drawing I m On IPad And 
len ratingfour I Hoped That It Will Have That In Google Drive And Guess What 
len ratingfour IT WASN T THERE 
len ratingone I love this app but since it no longer supports passcode lock I have no option but to uninstall it 
len ratingfive  So easy so accessible 
len ratingfive The whole thing is free and is super helpful for getting organized 
len ratingfive Also the interface is easy to use and it automatically saves so you won t accidentally lose your files 
len ratingfive I recommend it a lot 
len ratingone The app constantly just closes while I m listening to music and the app would be better if it played songs one after another
len ratingfive  Behtreen

len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingfive  I don t think a single day has passed since that I haven t used Google Drive 
len ratingfive Best app
len ratingfive It s like driving on the country side and suddenly you look up because you can feel the eagles as you pass the Hotel California then as you turn the bend their taking pictures all the time your downloading everything your seeing and hearing feeling and wanting everything is at your finger tips then you take all of that which you collect and go to the moon and still access your whip I love to drive

len ratingthree In the past I have been able to save my work to Google drive 
len ratingthree Later on I would open the work on my iPad and be able to view the file

len ratingthree When I do the same process and it comes time to opening the file on my iPad it simply won t open 
len ratingthree I can see the file and the preview in Google drive quite clearly However the file simply won t open 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingone  Enough with the pop ups 
len ratingone I ll review if I want to 
len ratingfive Great to backup pics across multiple platforms
len ratingone  Find is no more there for google docs
len ratingtwo See above
len ratingfive  The best cloud there is even better then iCloud 
len ratingfour  This app provides an easy method of uploading downloading saving and sharing documents 
len ratingfour It is my go to storage 
len ratingfour I do suspect that Google scans all my docs and nothing is private to them 
len ratingfour I can t prove it but if I find out they are scanning my uploads they are toast 
len ratingfour  It doesn t let me download my university books 
len ratingone  I created a new folder and when I tried to put in the name you asked for feedback on top of the input I was trying to type the folder name into 
len ratingone I then went into the folder one tap later you asked me again 
len ratingone I uploaded a photo you asked me again so I gave you star 
len ratingone Bad form Google 
len ratingfive  It works fine 
len ratingfive Interface is very smooth either I open it on iphone windows pc or online 
len ratingfive Nice 
len ratingfour  Google Drive works guite well and has proven beneficial for sharing data 
len ratingfour I have used it for several years 
len ratingfour We use the product on a PC 
len ratingfour Syncing files is problematic 
len ratingfour Uninstalling and re installing does not fix the problem 
len ratingfour Support on line and by phone also brings no solution 
len ratingfour I have found setting up another user on the PC and installing under the new user is the only way I have been able to get sync to work 
len ratingfour  Google Drive is a nuisance when it comes to searching a file in my drive and opening as an original document such as a Word or an Excel doc 
len ratingfour And one you find it two issues arise it opens as a google doc and the drive does not show its location on the drive 
len ratingfour Most of the time DETAIL on the right column shows no detail I have reported this problem time and again and google has done nothing 
len ratingfive I use this app all the time 
len ratingone I got drive hoping that I could work on a google sheet I created 
len ratingone Once I got the app I could view it but I could not edit the sheet without getting another app but I don t see why I shouldn t be able to edit documents sheets and slideshows all in one app 
len ratingone Instead I m stuck with an app where all I can do is look at them 
len ratingone Not really useful in my case
len ratingfive  Greatest app for storage ever 
len ratingone  VERY frustrating that there is no real upload progress bar on desktop app 
len ratingfive I never lose the code I m working on

len ratingfive  Is the best 
len ratingfour  Stores plenty of files 
len ratingfour Doesn t crash like my scanning app did never loses stuff 
len ratingfour That s a key feature 
len ratingfour And it s free 
len ratingfour It would be cool if one could organize some way other than linearly but maybe that s a lot to ask even from almighty big bro goog 
len ratingfive Great way to save pics 
len ratingfive There s so much space and I like the way you can organize them so easily and quickly find what you want 
len ratingfive Also easy to retrieve and move copy etc 
len ratingthree But sometimes images and previews won t load 
len ratingfive  Hello I was hoping to find a feature where i can download a video of what my brother n law shared with me onto my iphone

len ratingfive I especially want this so I can do it while I sleep because my internet is bad please reconnect updating drive to where it has a feature to schedule uploads or downloads 
len ratingtwo  Used this app for a long time for audiobooks and loved it no issues but had to delete it for space

len ratingone Bring it back 
len ratingfive  Thanks for new way to be positive with gifts of life 
len ratingone  Slow spinning color wheel on literally every app action 
len ratingone Photos and folders take forever to load regardless of internet connection even with mbps speeds or device 
len ratingone Garbage 
len ratingone My weekend project is converting years of files to dropbox I m over google apps drive
len ratingthree  Despite three support causes uninstalling Google Drive reinstalling Drive uninstalling Drive then replacing it with Backup and Sync Google support has not been able to resolve consistent Sync failures certain files and certain renamed folders 
len ratingfive This is not something I would recommend it is something I would argue you NEED to ready allow your tablet to do and be what it s meant to 
len ratingfive I wouldn t even care if Google is secretly collecting and selling info from me because I have nothing to hide AND it is essential to my daily tasks 
len ratingfive Love you Google drive 
len ratingfive  The best 
len ratingone  Google drive used to be an easy app to upload pictures now with google pics something has changed and drive will no longer take pictures 
len ratingone Needs to be a way to transfer Drive pictures to Google Pictures and be done with Drive 
len ratingfive  Love being able to get to all of my stuff with ease 
len ratingfive  Very nice and useable application
len ratingone  Google just turned off any passcode touchID for the app 
len ratingone This is not secure in the slightest 
len ratingfive I Love This App it is very very user friendly an even a kid can recieve or upload files 
len ratingfive Thank u this App
len ratingfive I just love it
len ratingfour  I love Google drive 
len ratingfour However I wish the import was a little smarter and dated the pics and I wish that I can import more than one pic from text messages instead of saving pics and then importing them 
len ratingfour But it s easy to import convenient to use and download to share again 
len ratingone  Just stop every time I back out of a picture you ask for a review
len ratingfour Link sharing is difficult 
len ratingfour Some links shareable via desktop is not allowed via app
len ratingfive Up buenos program a
len ratingone Every time I try to load the pictures for preview very slow response 
len ratingone Sometimes I have to restart the app to load all over again 
len ratingfour  Simple tasks are counter productive at best with this app 
len ratingfour Disappointing 
len ratingfive  Easy quick to access can pull up and work or view from any place on any device so much better than Microsoft Office
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive When I need to make a modification to a doc slide sheet etc 
len ratingfive  OF COURSE I HAVE ALL THE GOOGLE APPS I just go into my phone or tablet 
len ratingfive Viola 
len ratingfive It s done 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive  I use it for everything 
len ratingfive It is easy to use and organize 
len ratingfive I can access it from my phone or laptop which is important 
len ratingthree First thing I am writing about today is the fact that would give it and stars but I can t I gave it Anyway there IS a good reason for my ratings of this app I find it difficult to navigate 
len ratingthree If Apple made it which I am pretty sure it did they invented the iPhone which has the PERFECT way to navigate 
len ratingfive  Awesome google
len ratingfive  Para mi es necesaria porque guardo mucho documentos de escuela trabajo es practica para usar 
len ratingfive  So much yes 
len ratingone It worked fine but went wrong since google tried to introduce back up and sync
len ratingone Google drive google docs etc are awkward to use they always have been 
len ratingone I only downloaded it because i thought it would be easier to access things an associate of mine uses the drive for shockingly not the app makes nothing easier 
len ratingone Literally it s almost please take some pointers from Apple on how to be user friendly 
len ratingone Seriously
len ratingfive  Opens and edits just about every type of documents relevant to me and files are easily made accessible offline 
len ratingfive What more can a person ask 
len ratingfive Indispensable for my graduate studies 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is Amazing for my business
len ratingfour  Pretty good and fast 
len ratingfour I like to upload my data 
len ratingfour It is easier to use than others 
len ratingthree  Please for the love of anything that might be holy 
len ratingthree I use drive for audio recording back up 
len ratingthree Let me clear the cache 
len ratingthree Please 
len ratingfive  It s awsome 
len ratingfive  UI 
len ratingone  Happens after every preview
len ratingtwo Bring back passcode lock
len ratingtwo  Fix it
len ratingone The removal of passcode Touch ID lock is a big let down and a HUGE deal to me 
len ratingone I don t care if I can lock my iPhone altogether sometimes I unlock my phone and hand it over to someone to use it and I have no problem with them accessing anything except Google Drive 
len ratingone Now I have to deal with a new problem because Google removed passcode lock and Drive on my phone is accessible to anyone who uses my phone while it s unlocked 
len ratingone Again no I don t want to lock my phone altogether 
len ratingone Below was my initial star review which I take back 
len ratingone  I use Drive to backup everything 
len ratingone From documents to mp files photos and videos 
len ratingone I could use Google Photos for unlimited photo and video backup but I ve been using Drive for a while and find it more intuitive simpler and easier to use 
len ratingone Besides I d rather have all sorts of file types in one place 
len ratingone Also the free gigs are enough so far 
len ratingfive  Aaa
len ratingfive  This is such a useful way to store things across all my devices 
len ratingfive I have a note taking app on my iPad Pro which uploads straight to Google drive which I can access from any device 
len ratingfive It s also got a wonderful amount of storage space for free unlike iCloud 
len ratingfive  Great fine they forced me to write this and that was annoying but the app is what u expected
len ratingfive Thank You Very Much 
len ratingtwo I don t like having to have all the different apps for docs and slides and stuff 
len ratingtwo Make it all on google drive again 
len ratingfive  This app has allowed me to save high quality files for my home base business
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive I go back and forth between Dropbox and google apps 
len ratingfive I usually come back to google 
len ratingfive Those 
len ratingfive Smart guys there make me work faster which should make me more money 
len ratingfive Someday 
len ratingfive  I strongly recommend this app 
len ratingfive Since I downloaded it has make my life easier guarantee 
len ratingfive  GDrive works 
len ratingfive Save files 
len ratingfive Access on the go 
len ratingfive A lot of apps allow uploading from GD which adds convenience to the app s attributes 
len ratingfive It s a Google product so it s constantly being updated and will get better over time 
len ratingfive That s all I got 
len ratingfive Stick with it everyone 
len ratingfive  O app t liso
len ratingfour  There is always room for improvement 
len ratingfive This is great 
len ratingfive More power to all the staff
len ratingtwo The app gets two stars but only because it technically works 
len ratingtwo Just because something works at its core does not mean I automatically like it 
len ratingtwo The developers seem to have removed the abiliy to play sound files in the background on iPad 
len ratingtwo  I don t know that this works again with the new updates 
len ratingtwo Additionally this app repeatedly interrupted my work to tell me to rate it 
len ratingtwo I should not have to rate a FREE app in order to use it so I will give it the rating it deserves 
len ratingtwo Both of these issues are extremely frustrating to me and ruin what is otherwise a solid application 
len ratingfive I like using google drive it is simple and easy to use 
len ratingfive Love the multi platform availability 
len ratingfive  Very useful especially with mobile devices 
len ratingfive  Muy buen programa 
len ratingfive Great app works wonderfully no problems always updating and continue the great work
len ratingfour Testing new version and very angry that managing a group or department will be much harder if not impossible 
len ratingfive  It s so easy to save my documents after class 
len ratingone  You will get one star for being so intrusive in asking me every time I open the app to rate it 
len ratingfive  Ser a ideal poder convertir los documentos a PDF para poder escribir con el Apple Pencil en ellos
len ratingfive  Awesome thank you
len ratingtwo Google Drive is a great concept but is usually very slow 
len ratingtwo On top of that to use docs or slides you need another two apps 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone Choke 
len ratingone  Google KYS y all trash
len ratingthree  Hard to sync with windows desktop only wants to recognize laptop and phone
len ratingfour  It is nice and organized 
len ratingfour However it takes a long long time to find all of my files 
len ratingfour Since they are all just called file jpg and pdf it is hard to find them 
len ratingfour That s why I only gave stars 
len ratingfive Yup
len ratingfive  This help me get all my work done so I could get my NPs up
len ratingfive  Inlike the it s privet
len ratingfive Odlicna aplikacija i vrlo korisna
len ratingfive  There might be a few bugs here and there but over all it is awesome
len ratingfive  Thank you
len ratingfive Go to app for shared file storage 
len ratingfive Seamlessly integrates with docs and sheets 
len ratingfive I use it for photo sharing with clients 
len ratingfive  It just works 
len ratingfive It s good stuff to miss it 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingtwo  No notification when I reached max capacity and needed to change picture storage which they added and made it seem like it was free but not for full resolution 
len ratingtwo All of a sudden emails are frozen 
len ratingtwo Fixed the problem but there should be better notification before you stop getting emails 
len ratingone  Why is the passcode lock not available anymore 
len ratingone I need to protect my files 
len ratingfive  Lets me access my documents anywhere dont need my laptop all the tomes 
len ratingfive This app is great for school 
len ratingfive Really like this app works great and it s free for the first G s 
len ratingfive It can be a real life saver if you set it up and it easy to use 
len ratingfive Recomiendo el uso de esta aplicaci n es fant stica y muy f cil de utilizar 
len ratingfive I can do all my schoolwork with it
len ratingfive  Google drive works well on the iPhone as do the other Google apps 
len ratingfive At home I have become a Chrome book box person and they all play nicely together with the Google aps 
len ratingfive The only complaint I have is that I have found no way to password protect a file or folder outside of creating a password protected pdf file 
len ratingfive But with double verification my files are secure except for prying close family or friends who borrow my devise while it s open 
len ratingfive  Like it 
len ratingfive  App works great and updates between my devices quickly 
len ratingfive If you work on the go or collaborate this is a great tool 
len ratingone  Keeps closing out of app while using
len ratingfive  Great asset 
len ratingfive It s GREAT For all my digital photography and Shopify store files 
len ratingfive Easy accessible add more storage whenever you want never lose a thing 
len ratingfive Keeps all my files safe and secure AND I don t bog down my Mac with a ton of large size files 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Drive Team Ginny Founder mythriftjam A New Generation of Thrift
len ratingfive All I can say is thank very much google for everything from drive to YouTube 
len ratingfive My life depends on you on certain things of it 
len ratingone Stop asking me to write reviews 
len ratingone I m trying to work 
len ratingthree  Love this app but I wish it wasn t such a struggle to save pictures or videos from your drive to the phone 
len ratingthree Just add a download option to the menu 
len ratingfive I like poop it tastes good This app allows me to more easily access the poop very much thanks 
len ratingfive Very much thanks to poop drive
len ratingfive I work in sales and scan my material in my drive so I can keep it everywhere 
len ratingfive Works well so far and I still have loads of space 
len ratingtwo  So frustrated with this app at times 
len ratingtwo I upload files on my computer than try to open them on my iPad and nothing 
len ratingtwo Google fix this with your billions please 
len ratingfive Google Drive and google products are amazing long live the innovative Google Team 
len ratingfive  Very helpful and accessible for storing files
len ratingfour  It would be ideal if the iPhone Google Drive app had a scan option for uploads as exists on the android app where you can scan by snapping multiple pictures that all can encompass one single pdf 
len ratingfive I liek did progrem cuz itz so gud
len ratingone  As I try to use the difficult to search drive I am constantly asked to review the drive and service 
len ratingone When I say later I don t mean seconds later 
len ratingfive We use for our choir 
len ratingfive We can easily share links to recordings and music sites 
len ratingtwo My daily work spreadsheet doesn t update each time I open it 
len ratingtwo Rather just go thru safari to get info 
len ratingone  I give star reviews to any app that keeps bothering me with pop ups requesting a rating 
len ratingfive  Does its job 
len ratingfive Reliable 
len ratingfive Hi this app makes it easy to transfer and send files to large to attach to email 
len ratingfive Also good to back up files 
len ratingfive I use it to organize school work or documents 
len ratingfive  I can t watch my friends videos broken or wrong link
len ratingfive  Overall good but sometimes slides crashes on my phone and slide conversion Microsoft power point should improve
len ratingfive  I absolutely love GOOGLE DRIVE 
len ratingfive I am able to save and organize ALL of my BRAIN in on space please don t ever crash GOOGLE 
len ratingfour I love it it has all the features I need except one thing 
len ratingfour We need a Google Drawings app 
len ratingfour  I hate school and my life but i love this app thanks google
len ratingfive  Perfect
len ratingfive  Great for schooling 
len ratingfive The drive app is my everything 
len ratingfive I use it for work school creating schedules 
len ratingfive It s so reliable I use it daily
len ratingone please
len ratingfive It s great
len ratingtwo  Most of these best app in the world reviewers are bots 
len ratingtwo The app deserves a star because of its unlimited storage but good luck actually finding what you re looking for or being certain everything is backed up 
len ratingtwo They have no way to organize anything 
len ratingtwo It s just a huge clump of mess that you have to scroll through just to find anything 
len ratingtwo Google should stick to google photos 
len ratingone i get it you want stuff to be organised 
len ratingone but it changes all too often it s hard for one to have the same mindset when grouping things 
len ratingone also considerably buggy compared to desktop version 
len ratingfive  Great tool for our company
len ratingfive Legit i can save files from my laptop and i can open it o my iphone and ipad amazing 
len ratingfive  I love using google drive and sharing folders 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and to understand for someone like me that used to have an admin assistant 
len ratingfive Very user friendly 
len ratingthree I wish it was easier to organize large numbers of files 
len ratingthree If you have a couple of files it is easy 
len ratingthree A large volume of files it gets hairy to organize 
len ratingone Keeps crashing
len ratingfive  I love the flexibility and access provided with google drive 
len ratingfive Love to record lectures 
len ratingfive Google Drive allows me to free up space on my iCloud 
len ratingfive  Love the app 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Top company 
len ratingfour  So slowly in opening photos
len ratingfive Aplicaci n de mucha utilidad 
len ratingfive La utilizo a diario 
len ratingfive Me permite organizar mis archivos y tenerlos a la mano cuando requiera de ellos
len ratingfive  Confiable f cil de usar 
len ratingfive  START 
len ratingfour Numerous apps that access it can t find all directories 
len ratingfour This is TOO WEIRD 
len ratingfour Sounds like the API is buggy 
len ratingfour You have to SAVE wherever then fix the file structure manually later 
len ratingfour Other than that it s awesome 
len ratingfive Gigs for life would be the move 
len ratingfive  Very useful
len ratingfive It s just so smooth and easy to use
len ratingfive This app rocks 
len ratingfive  Excellent never crashed 
len ratingfive Seamless use between devices 
len ratingfive Slow on photo upload though 
len ratingfive Otherwise excellent 
len ratingfive This is a great app for holding on documents and more 
len ratingfive  This storage is easy and great to use 
len ratingfive It lets me share pictures with a group without having to email mega sized files 
len ratingfive And I can access from any computer I m at depending on security protocols 
len ratingone I wonder why drive only asked me for feedback when something went wrong 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is the best service for online arbor age 
len ratingone I upload an image from my desktop to google drive via the web 
len ratingone On my phone depending on how I download that image to my camera roll it is much smaller 
len ratingone If I tap the image on my phone it prompts me to save the image to camera roll clicking OK results in a smaller image 
len ratingone I had to download a third party app to check the size of the photo in my camera roll 
len ratingone Also uploading it to google drive will confirm the size is smaller 
len ratingone On the other hand opening up the photo on your google drive app again and instead of taping the photo tapping the three dots in the upper left hand corner you will get a menu and you click send a copy and then save image This results with the photo being the same size as the original 
len ratingone But I used to be able to do it the other way 
len ratingone Now for the stranger part 
len ratingone If you do it the first way and the image is smaller and then you try do it the send a copy way after the image is still smaller 
len ratingone You have to re upload the images from your desktop again 
len ratingone And not tap the image but tap the three dots in the upper left hand corner 
len ratingone I tried using google pictures but I was not able to uploaded images from my desktop to the google photos website 
len ratingone I don t want to use the desktop application 
len ratingfive  It s very useful for my class I got this app on a recommendation by someone i know and this is truly a very appy app
len ratingfour  Annoying reminder to submit a review 
len ratingone Does not automatically backup my photos defeats the purpose of this useless app 
len ratingfive  Best storage app out there 
len ratingfive  After using Dropbox for years I am so thankful for Drive 
len ratingfive So easy to use connect to my email and share with others 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingone  After upgrading the ios music playing keeps stopping 
len ratingone  It is super inefficient
len ratingfive  Muito bom
len ratingfive  I have checked so many options and never been a fan of google Team IPhone haha but say what you want they have the best deals around and start you with GB free 
len ratingfive It s the only app I use for storage now 
len ratingfive This app is spectacular
len ratingone  This app is great except that it crashes once or twice basically every time I listen to a song through it 
len ratingone So that s good
len ratingfive Awesome service 
len ratingfive Very helpful 
len ratingfive  I enjoy the ease of how we can share files At a push of a button and send to many 
len ratingfive  I love it 
len ratingfive It keeps me very organized and easy access 
len ratingfive This app allows me to collaborate with my colleagues and control my entire classroom including grading on the go from my phone or iPad 
len ratingfive I love the flexibility and intuitive nature of the program as well as how seamlessly it integrates with my existing Apple technologies 
len ratingfive Additionally it allows me to upload files photos from my phone to save for later date or free up space if I wish 
len ratingthree  The app is good but it would be great if it supported more file types
len ratingone  App keeps crashing when I leave it running in the background 
len ratingone Only wrote this review because every time I d exit a file it would ask me to review 
len ratingone So I finally did after the app asked me times in a row 
len ratingfive  It really helps me with being able to store my homework anywhere at anytime
len ratingfive  Very useful fast and easy to navigate 
len ratingfive Must have for the serious file storer 
len ratingone  Pain in the hiney managing multiple photos to print
len ratingfour This app allows you to type in documents of any kind 
len ratingfour However you would have to install the apps of the different kinds of documents to be able to access it 
len ratingfour Overall though it s very organized and useful 
len ratingfour Great for projects and organization related to work 
len ratingfive  Google provides a wonderful product app with a ton of free storage that s incredibly easy to use and let me add that I own an iPhone and it still works seamlessly even with my Apple apps 
len ratingfive Top notch program all the way 
len ratingfive Daniela Constantino
len ratingthree  I enjoy using Google Drive as it makes school work much easier for me to do 
len ratingthree However when I try uploading photos for my lab there is a problem 
len ratingthree Only photos would pop up in my folder instead of the photos 
len ratingthree My friend tried uploading the photos as well but the same problem happened to him 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  You can never edit on this app 
len ratingfive You have to have the docs app 
len ratingfive But even then it only lets you view 
len ratingfive Come on google
len ratingfive  I am falling in love with every google app I find 
len ratingfive Not o my is this drive amazing 
len ratingfive But it does more than anything I could expect including holding my forms etc all in one place 
len ratingfive If there is a way to get notifications for forms submitted that s the only thing I would like to know 
len ratingfive Love google everything 
len ratingone  Stop telling me to rate this
len ratingfive Dropbox allows you to create PDF files with multiple pages by using your camera to scan 
len ratingfive Drive needs that 
len ratingfive It can only create image files when scanning
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingone Not yet downloaded to either iPad or s though both have space and have been on WiFi all day
len ratingtwo  Apparently rtf files are no longer supported and won t open so the app is unusable for me 
len ratingfive This app is free and its better than word PowerPoint and Excel 
len ratingfive So there is literally no reason to buy those programs 
len ratingfive Just use google duh 
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive I love Google Drive you are able to save documents on your drive and upload the documents on my iPhone in so many words I am able to apply for jobs and upload my resume on my iPhone 
len ratingfive  You guys are really good at helping people
len ratingfive  Love good
len ratingthree  I use Google Drive every day 
len ratingthree I am disappointed that it still has some bugs on my iPad like not updating folders and files despite me doing it manually 
len ratingthree Also I don t like that when I want to open a file it takes me to the Google Docs app where organizing my files is clunky 
len ratingthree I just think Google Drive could work more smoothly 
len ratingfive Exactly what I need
len ratingtwo  I took beautiful professional photos and I try to save them to my device via google drive 
len ratingtwo Doesn t work 
len ratingtwo The photos don t want to load the full size image to view and if when it does the only way to get the photo is by sending it to someone else and often times the app will freeze glitch out or crash while doing this 
len ratingtwo Sooo frustrating to have to try to do this let alone send each photo individually 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingfive  What an amazingly thought through synced useful piece of software genius 
len ratingfive I surely appreciate being truly organized and able to find anything w a few keystrokes 
len ratingfive And the ease of being able to share and collaborate makes doing projects far less onerous As are all things Apple 
len ratingfive EXCELLENT 
len ratingfive Mary Ann Wright
len ratingtwo  I can t complete my back up since it s already complete although it isn t
len ratingfive  I love you
len ratingthree  Hmmm 
len ratingfive  I like this app and it does help me a lot
len ratingthree We have a very small team and I purchased one terabyte of storage so we could share files back and forth with our production company unfortunately when my assistant shares a large file with me he counts against his quota even though I own the file and plenty of storage space this is a real problem in my opinion false advertising please fix this issue 
len ratingthree  Takes a long time for the pictures to download for viewing 
len ratingfour  Muy f cil de configurar y usar herramienta muy til 
len ratingfive Love that I can save documents etc 
len ratingfive once in a while it takes a while to see your documents but usually pretty quick 
len ratingfive  This provides me with mobility of my files without the fear of leaving my Dong le laying about 
len ratingfive This way my privates stay private and I don t have others peeking at my junk 
len ratingfive  This app is so versatile 
len ratingfive I use it for everything from photos to documents 
len ratingfive I don t know what I would do without it 
len ratingfive  Muito pr tico e til esse drive que nos permite estar sempre de posse de nossos arquivos em qualquer lugar sem a necessidade de levar dispositivos de armazenamento ou equipamentos 
len ratingfive Uma facilidade que nos ajuda muito inclusive a manter nossos arquivos atualizados em todos os nossos dispositivos ao mesmo tempo al m de permitir compartilhar com outras pessoas 
len ratingfive Armando Bonfadini
len ratingfive  It s great 
len ratingfour Pretty good but often a little clunky but always makes my life easier
len ratingfive  The best platform ever to save my files 
len ratingfive  Great 
len ratingfour App works well for the most part 
len ratingfour It s pretty slow sometimes but as I use it to keep a large inventory that s to be expected 
len ratingfour I like the customization and the file keeping I don t like how often I was asked to rate the app 
len ratingfive So helpfull I couldn t live without for school too 
len ratingone  Doesn t work on iOS if file sharing is locked down for organisation 
len ratingone Android based Google drive is flawless in my opinion 
len ratingone IOS however leaves a lot to be desired 
len ratingone One of the best features available to Android users is the ability to use the camera as a scanner and create multiple page pdf files for upload 
len ratingone IOS completely lacks this ability 
len ratingone Instead of a pdf is a photo of the document and there isn t an option to create multiple page files by hitting the little plus sign as in android 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingtwo Every time I try to listen to music it closes it in the middle of the song I have no idea why 
len ratingtwo I hope it gets fixed 
len ratingtwo Thank you for your time reading my review 
len ratingone Geez
len ratingfive I store all my businesses documents in google drive and can access them anywhere with any device 
len ratingfive I also collaborate real time with my team on proposals and meeting documents 
len ratingfive  I like it
len ratingfour Semi new to using but so far it s been great 
len ratingfour Safely storing my important documents in one convenient location is both time saving happiness making 
len ratingfour This app is awesome and very user friendly 
len ratingfour The only problem I have found so far is with pdfs 
len ratingfour App is not able to load all the pages at once or turns black in certain page or crashes if you keep trying to scroll between pages 
len ratingfour Please fix it and this app will be Oscar winning 
len ratingone  If you pester folks repeatedly you get star
len ratingfour I take notes in college by writing on pdf s but my annotations only show up through drive when I view the pdf on a computer 
len ratingfour This app won t let me view my annotations on the pdf 
len ratingfour Everything else great though 
len ratingone  Not working
len ratingfive  Works great 
len ratingfive  Works great for school
len ratingfive ME AN INTELLECTUAL THRIVE WITH ALL GOOGLE SERVICES 
len ratingfive GOOGLE DRIVE GOOGLE PHOTOS SAVED MY BUSINESS FROM LOSING YEARS WORTH OF CONTENT WORK I SPREAD THE GOSPEL ALL THAT LISTEN RAGEON
len ratingone Being nagged to rate and post a review after every single file I open is extremely poor usability

len ratingfive Please help 
len ratingfive It takes a few moments each day of activity and you can sort all of your phone captions pics docs receipts etc intonfilders you ve created for easy access at a later time 
len ratingone You got my hopes up with an update unless it was just a glitch either way my music still won t okay so I implore you to fix audio files playing 
len ratingone It always worked before maybe you should take a step back to the old update 
len ratingone  I have audio files on google drive and whenever I listen the audio cuts out and forgets where I am and I have to restart the folder and the file manually 
len ratingone It happens regardless of whether or not I have headphones in so it is a drive interface issue not phone issue 
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfive  onedrive google drive onedrive google google drive

len ratingfive It s so perfect 
len ratingfive I haven t found any bugs in the app yet luckily 
len ratingtwo  Google is known for doing these things 
len ratingtwo They release a product with great features which they subsequently strip away 
len ratingtwo How do they benefit from remove the smart features of doc scanning cropping enhancement PDF creation 
len ratingtwo Nobody knowas 
len ratingtwo Good thing I never stopped using the superior csmscanner app 
len ratingtwo This is a fail Google 
len ratingfive  Fast easy and useful
len ratingfive I was always a relative happy Microsoft user 
len ratingfive But I love how Google makes it so easy to start a document or presentation on one device and then continue on another device or let someone else take over by sharing the document 
len ratingfive All while it s backed up in the cloud 
len ratingfive Pictures and all 
len ratingfive  Amazingly easy to use 
len ratingfive way better than computerized version 
len ratingfive  I use this for everything work and personal 
len ratingfive Good buy thumb drive hello future master of the universe Google 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive Very useful that I could check my file any time 
len ratingfive  I ve been using Drive since it was first released and every file I ve ever uploaded is STILL there working as perfectly as it did a decade ago 
len ratingfive I don t use anything else 
len ratingfive Google Drive is unbeatable 
len ratingfive  Anything Google is Goodle
len ratingfive A must have for iPad user that don t like apple icloud interface
len ratingfour  good app but need more free space please
len ratingfive  Convenient for storing and retrieving docs etc
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive So many photos I can store thank you 
len ratingone  Google Drive doesn t work with iOS 
len ratingone It crashes when any file over kb is opened 
len ratingone In general Google has been steadily slipping over time 
len ratingone Their apps are becoming worthless 
len ratingone Everything they do is becoming worthless 
len ratingtwo I downloaded this because I was having issues with my iPhone and I was afraid of losing my photos 
len ratingtwo I was happy with the unlimited storage however I have close to photos 
len ratingtwo It took me a very long time to go through and click each picture individually because there is not a select all button 
len ratingtwo This is highly inconvenient and time consuming for anyone who is using the app for the first time and trying to backup the photos they already have 
len ratingtwo I know not everyone has as many as I do but even if I only had photos that still would have taken a while 
len ratingtwo Then to make things better sarcasm when I finally finished selecting all of my photos and then hit upload it said uploading and then it just stopped and went to the homepage 
len ratingtwo It did not upload ANY of my photos 
len ratingtwo Also I had to leave the room for a moment and my screen locked when I got back on all of the photos I had selected had been unselected and I had to start all over 
len ratingtwo Please fix these issues 
len ratingfive I would recommend it to anyone who uses google applications on a day to day basis 
len ratingfive It does take a little while to learn how to use it but after that it s a cinch 
len ratingfive  Does what it s supposed to without complications
len ratingfive  Saving files from iPad or iPhone is easy 
len ratingfive Google drive shows up as an option to save 
len ratingfive It can t get any easier 
len ratingfive One more step closer to not needing a laptop 
len ratingfive  Perfect on the iphone
len ratingfive  Can t tell you how powerfully this has changed my workflow and my storage habits 
len ratingfive It s a breakthrough for me specifically because I have my email my documents and my music photo storage all under the same ID and it s all accessible from both personal computers and everywhere else 
len ratingfive I could not be happier 
len ratingtwo  I recently downloaded this for a project and the app was very buggy 
len ratingtwo  I could only access shared files by link it wouldn t show what I d upload into the folder and wouldn t allow me to delete 
len ratingtwo I suggest using apps as an individual app 
len ratingtwo Documents was much less buggy and easier to use 
len ratingthree  I m not sure if I m the only one but my drive app keeps crashing 
len ratingthree I only use it to listen to music and other mps I can t listen to on my phone because of the whole Apple Music and iTunes library situation but now whenever I play any song my drive shuts down after about seconds 
len ratingthree And I ve reset my phone several times to no avail 
len ratingfive  It s good
len ratingfive  My brain
len ratingthree  In the last few months google removed the ability to select the Drive location to which to upload a file 
len ratingthree Instead we now have a two step process upload the file to the main Drive window then move the file to a subfolder 
len ratingthree Please restore the capability of being able to select thelocation when uploading a file 
len ratingfour  I absolutely love Google Drive 
len ratingfour It is so nice to be able to access my documents from my phone iPad and Mac 
len ratingfour However I recently got an iPhone and can not access my team drive 
len ratingfour It doesn t even show up in the menu 
len ratingfour Any ideas 
len ratingfour I use my team drive much more than my regular drive so this app will not be useful to me until I can access it 
len ratingfive  Amazing benefits 
len ratingfive So easy to use and reliable 
len ratingfive  Kind of amazing how well this works 
len ratingfive Only downside is that now I don t have an excuse to say sorry I won t have access to my work documents until Monday 
len ratingfive  This app is better than my computer 
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive Use it personally and in the office 
len ratingfive If you need a way to organize your life docs pics seriously consider Google Drive 
len ratingfive Love the ease of use and the fact I can access all my stuff across all my media platforms 
len ratingfive It works on iOS Android 
len ratingfive I use it daily and can t imagine life without it 
len ratingfive  thumbs up 
len ratingthree I had trouble downloading this and now there is a dark google drive icon that I can t click on or delete stuck on my screen Can some body help me get rid of it please 
len ratingfive  Cool
len ratingfive There is nothing missed 
len ratingfive  Hands Down best file document host that is currently on the market 
len ratingfive  Excellent and Fuctional app
len ratingfive  The ultimate pressure reliever 
len ratingfive All your files just a click away on all your devices 
len ratingfive Leading edge access storage share tool that is very open and compatible 
len ratingfive Allows me to share docs images with collegues and select access levels via a link 
len ratingfive Accessable from any web enabled device 
len ratingfour With no files stored for offline the app itself eats up way too much phone storage space
len ratingfive  This drive is dependable always there and working when I need it 
len ratingfive And I have no worries about security I have all Google s security things turned like factor ID 
len ratingtwo  I can t download or send my files via email Skype WhatsApp text message etc for some reason 
len ratingtwo This is the really the main use in for the app in my opinion other than being able to see your docs and share their links 
len ratingone  Ever since I got the upgrade it will not let update it 
len ratingtwo When I m in the middle of playing an audio file it will crash now something it didn t do before the last update 
len ratingtwo Please update and fix this bug google I don t want to have to switch to Dropbox 
len ratingfive  I have an iPhone with a GB capacity 
len ratingfive Having google drive allows me to move documents and photos to the cloud making room in my phone for it to fiction as it should with no annoying messages about it being full 
len ratingfive AP

len ratingfive When I tap search drive a menu comes up 
len ratingfive I now have to tap on the search bar to input the search term 
len ratingfive It really slows me down why isn t the cursor there blinking and waiting for input 
len ratingfive Fix this and this app is perfect 
len ratingfive  It s terrific been able to access my Google Drive from my iPhone 
len ratingfive And works great 
len ratingfive Works well for all intents and purposes 
len ratingfour Could have included attaching a folder option to email 
len ratingfour Taking off a star for that 
len ratingfive Was able to save the voicemails from my father who passed away from my phone that I was trading in 
len ratingfive I also use OneDrive from Microsoft and this google drive serves me a a supplement space 
len ratingfive No problem using it so far 
len ratingfive I just love google and it s apps 
len ratingfive  As a teacher and collaborator Drive has saved me hours of time thank you Google 
len ratingfive  I love that it saves my pictures and important documents 
len ratingfive Backing up Mobile devices on both operating systems has never been easier
len ratingfive  It s always worked alright for me I just had to get on a Mac machine for it to work right 
len ratingfive It always flaked out when I try using it on my Windows laptop 
len ratingtwo Ugh 
len ratingtwo Fix your fix please 
len ratingtwo Ever since last update app continues to close by itself mid use
len ratingthree  It is very slow to start up but is a great app once it eventually starts running

len ratingfive Saves me a lot of time 
len ratingfive  Good to save all photo in here 
len ratingfive Drive is so helpful I ve been able to use it to clear up space on my phone by uploading pics and videos 
len ratingfive The app recently started crashing when playing an audio file 
len ratingfive Can this be looked into 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Other than that it s great 
len ratingfive Since Drive isn t supporting its mobile web site anymore I feel that it should be imperative to be able to play caption tracks along with the videos that are captioned 
len ratingfive Just a thought since I have a severe hearing loss 
len ratingfive And another thing please implement chrome casting on this app 
len ratingfive It would work many wonders 
len ratingfive Thanks in advance

len ratingfive  Great app that allows mass storage and flexibility amongst several devices 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive  Provides the online data storage and file sharing that I need 
len ratingfive  Works well
len ratingthree  Hello I am a long time google drive user 
len ratingthree I have seen the changes over the years and they are fantastic 
len ratingthree The most valuable is being able to see modifications and being able to revert to an earlier version 
len ratingthree I rated a out of because I have major issues using Drive and Docs on my iPad Air 
len ratingthree I utilize my iPad for my profession as a psychologist in my clinical work 
len ratingthree In between meetings and supervision it is much easier to utilize a tablet and cloud based storage 
len ratingthree I can easily email from drive or share any file with anyone around me 
len ratingthree I can use nearly all of the desktop features 
len ratingthree I major pitfall is having a document being corrupted 
len ratingthree This happens if I frequently toggle between Drive and other applications 
len ratingthree I freak out and have a mental stroke 
len ratingthree I have to find access to a desktop computer and hope that there is an uncorrupted version 
len ratingthree This has caused me to change and primarily use Word and their cloud to work on my iPad 
len ratingthree OneDrive has been more reliable on my iPad which is greatly needed for my career 
len ratingfive  This app saves me time by allowing me to access the documents I have in Google Drive from my iPhone 
len ratingthree Slow with downloading videos from my camera 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s great 
len ratingfive There isn t anything I ve needed to do with my cloud files that Drive has inhibited 
len ratingfive It s like a hard drive without hardware 
len ratingfive Lighter than a laptop too 
len ratingfour Kool
len ratingfive  I wouldn t go anywhere without it 
len ratingfive This is essentially a mini filing cabinet on all the computing devices I use mine or someone else s 
len ratingfive I use it for transferring files from IPhone to desktop 
len ratingfive Works great and easy to use 
len ratingfive Google stuff works better 
len ratingfour  Overall I think this is very good app but difficult to navigate at times 
len ratingfour For example it s hard to attach a document to an email 
len ratingfive This app does everything I would want it to do on my phone 
len ratingfive  Everything where I need it 
len ratingfive When I need it 
len ratingfive I make everyone in my life use their Google drive and related apps 
len ratingfive Can t wait to see more features 
len ratingfive  amazing so amazing like wow Its saved me so many times
len ratingfive Just great 
len ratingfive  Drive keeps all docs at my fingertips where ever I am 
len ratingfive Resolution for people on the go
len ratingfive  I used Google Drive to import audio files I was working on for the purpose of checking mixes before I upload them to Apple Music for everyone else to hear 
len ratingfive Now the app won t play in the background AND the vibrate button HAS to be off for the music to even be heard 
len ratingfive Now I have to see about Dropbox instead 
len ratingfive edit The revisions since then have been great I find that the app quits out of nowhere with the latest update smh 
len ratingfive  Great functionality Always works Perfectly easy to use
len ratingfive Can t give enough thanks for this useful app 
len ratingfive Saves me so much time and hassle 
len ratingfive Happy camper here 
len ratingfive  Made transitioning to my new iPhone a breeze 
len ratingfive I save all my docs on here pictures from my first phone etc 
len ratingfive I love google
len ratingthree Using the latest version of ios and the latest version of google drive app and it get stuck in the processing uploads screen many times
len ratingfive  Works well and easy to use 
len ratingfive Needed a way to keep all files up to date and have the ability to look at them on any computer or my phone 
len ratingfive Does it perfectly
len ratingfive It s so convenient
len ratingfive Does exactly what it s supposed to do 
len ratingfive Work and work well 
len ratingfive  Great app love it
len ratingfive  I like so much this app from google 
len ratingfive Drive works every time everywhere 
len ratingfive You can access your documents without problem 
len ratingfive I recommend it
len ratingfive  Google drive is awesome 
len ratingfive I ve been using it for years and the drive has always been reliable 
len ratingfive I ve been able to write my papers before Google separated the word processing option into a different app 
len ratingfive I wish it was all done in one app as before for the convenience of it 
len ratingfive Still google drive is great 
len ratingfive  I use this each day and it is so functional 
len ratingfive  Please don t ever change the format of this app 
len ratingfive Fantastic app for keeping all of my files easily accessible 
len ratingfive I love the Google drive works perfect can access all my docs and are always synced 
len ratingfour Works great 
len ratingfour No problems 
len ratingfour Just wish I can load import multiple files from my phone to drive at one time 
len ratingfive Truly helpful app 
len ratingfive I teach a lot of tech skills for a community college 
len ratingfive Many times I work at various locations off main campus 
len ratingfive My material is always available with this no I forgot my flash drive panic minutes into a commute 
len ratingfive It s there when I get there 
len ratingfive So far very robust and reliable 
len ratingfive I think everyone would agree with tech the most reliable wins 
len ratingtwo  If I already have google drive why do I need to also download google sheets in order to edit my spreadsheet document 
len ratingfive  Using this tool for word processing and spreadsheets because it is very easy to track se for sharing information
len ratingfive  The Gmail Google Dr Google photos are all great products and works perfect for my needs
len ratingfive Great
len ratingtwo  Because there is no option to clear the cache I have to frequently delete the app because it will take up gigs 
len ratingtwo Now the app crashes shortly after launching for seemingly no reason 
len ratingfive I love google drive but it made me download it because it wouldn t work online I don t mind though 
len ratingthree  Last major update broke rich text files on my phone 
len ratingthree They worked before 
len ratingthree Message now says problem with file 
len ratingthree As well the files iOS app does not play nicely with drive 
len ratingthree I would ignore the files app entirely though if rich text docs worked but they don t 
len ratingthree Fix this please 
len ratingfive  Awesome collaborative tool for productivity 
len ratingfive  So good
len ratingfive  Works well 
len ratingfive I use it all the time
len ratingfive  Great place to keep handy information for use when traveling

len ratingfive  My school district starting using Google and Google Drive for all school business 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and reliable 
len ratingfive I can share files with colleagues easily and make folders for student access 
len ratingfive Wonderful 
len ratingfive  Still keeping my stuff safe and stored so I m good with that
len ratingfive needed if you use gmail
len ratingfive  Google drive is a life saver for my wife and I who live a nomadic life and want to share and access documents on a daily weekly basis

len ratingfive  simply the best 
len ratingfive  It has a really workable interface and really user friendly
len ratingfive I like to keep my stuff organized and in folders 
len ratingfive This program makes it simple 
len ratingfive Very user friendly 
len ratingone  The iOS files app hijacking problem has returned 
len ratingone Will delete the app until I see its fixed 
len ratingfive  I usually go on my computer and go to drive but now I can go to my phone which is way better
len ratingfive I just love it 
len ratingfour  Love this tool for making documents and sharing them 
len ratingfour Great for the work team to all have available 
len ratingfour I use Google Sheets the most but have some features missing that I have waited for but still not come 
len ratingfour Even as I write this review there are features that Apple uses and are in this document but Sheets has not put back in since an update many months ago 
len ratingfour Since whenever that update was Sheets has not reinstalled dictation nor items like giving you a period when you double click or putting question marks and exclamation marks beside the last word of a sentence you just finished 
len ratingfour But since all the updates stability is outstanding 
len ratingfour And only once did the overall structure go down during what must of been a frantic time for Google 
len ratingfour Believe me I was scared to death too that I had lost a week of scheduling 
len ratingfour But all came back and it was fine 
len ratingfour Thanks Google 
len ratingone Why does the recent update take so long 
len ratingfive  Google slide Google doc team work 
len ratingthree  The app will not download with the latest update to the iOS system 
len ratingthree What happened X 
len ratingfive  Drive makes it easy to work mobile desktop share 
len ratingfive No words to say just amazing 
len ratingfour After most recent update amp files sometimes stop about minute and secs in 
len ratingfour Edited at least while playing in background and it doesn t happen every time 
len ratingfour It usually occurs when using safari Iphone SE
len ratingfive Great amount of free space gb clean design works with google mail Google maps and so on also has a lot of add ones such as google file remover Tip if you do not use google file remover when you try to delete to save space it will not change your quota
len ratingfour  I use it daily for school 
len ratingfour I can work with multiple people on the same document without being on the same computer 
len ratingfour I have two complaints 
len ratingfour I have to have separate apps for Google Docs Slides etc 
len ratingfour It also doesn t open some picture files 
len ratingfour Other than that it functions well 
len ratingfive  This is one of my key resource tools in my biz tool box 
len ratingfive This is perfect for me so easy to access and save btwn iPhone mini iPad and laptop 
len ratingfive Just so easy to share info with my husband 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingthree My band uses google drive for sharing ideas and what not 
len ratingthree Well I have been listening to the same audio files for a while now and with this new update the app just stops the playback during a song and then completely closes the app 
len ratingthree Please fix
len ratingfive This is the most convenient app when it comes to getting my pictures off my computer and on to my phone no matter how big the size of the file is

len ratingfive We love Google Drive 
len ratingfive Give it a try it 
len ratingfive for sure you will love it 
len ratingone  I used this app the other day to work on some editing work 
len ratingone Barely an hour in and my battery went from full and just off the charger to 
len ratingone Horrible drain on power and not worth the small amount of work I got done 
len ratingone I m very disappointed 
len ratingfive Love it but it is so slow to load
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingthree  The app is fine 
len ratingthree However a friend shared photos with me and I would like to move them to my Google Photo and to my iPhone 
len ratingthree There is no easy way to move photos using my iPhone 
len ratingthree I will have to go one by one to save them to my phone or to google photos 
len ratingfive  Fast access good job
len ratingfour Drive was working fine until I updated the app 
len ratingfour I use drive to listen to music on a daily basis but now said music stops only halfway through a song completely out of nowhere and when I go back to see what happens it closes me out of the app

len ratingfive With the new iOS update its even more convenient to use 
len ratingfive The app works seamlessly with the Files app 
len ratingfive It makes saving images documents pdfs webpages even as simple as dragging and dropping 
len ratingfive Then you can pull it up on any device with Google Drive installed 
len ratingfive Never has it been so easy to go between my Android iOS and Windows devices 
len ratingthree The update finally fixed it

len ratingfive  Reliable
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  I love using google drive it s so interactive and easy to use

len ratingone  If you try to open some non Google file types like text files or Word docs in the iOS Files app Google Drive will open and try to make you save the files to your Google account 
len ratingone Not acceptable so I uninstalled 
len ratingone The October update did not fix this

len ratingthree Disappointed 
len ratingfive I love Drive and all it s Apps 
len ratingfive They are not perfect yet but getting better all the time and already do of what I need them to do so thanks for that 
len ratingfive  I ve been using the Drive since it became available 
len ratingfive Tunes worlds of photos PDFs of legal documents all backed up safely for me 
len ratingfive It will be there when we have made it through Armageddon and the roaches evolved to read what I left there 
len ratingtwo  I m with the other people using an iPhone and or stuck on iOS 
len ratingtwo Google Drive asks me to update it every day 
len ratingtwo Surely it can t be that much of a difficulty to program like every other app on my phone that is fine with iOS 
len ratingtwo  Hello 
len ratingtwo You should be able to update your app now 
len ratingtwo There was a technical reason to not being able to support older devices but we ve made a change in our latest release 
len ratingtwo Thank you for being patient 
len ratingone I hate this app so much 
len ratingone The website is great and the service itself is awesome but this app is awful 
len ratingone Never loads pics and freezes and crashes 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone  I m sorry to hear about your frustrations 
len ratingone We always monitor freezes and crashes and look forward to making sure fewer of them happen with every release 
len ratingfive I love being able to access my drive from anywhere and any of my devices 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Great for sharing photos and files
len ratingfive  This is a great free tool for work or home

len ratingfive Using whatever media you need when you need it from desktops tablets and even your Smartphones Excellent job Google 
len ratingfive LOVE sharing lessons and work with students and other teachers 
len ratingfive So efficient and quick can prepare on the go and can adjust as needed 
len ratingone Huge security problem 
len ratingone When I attempt to open a file from my iPad or iPhone it immediately diverts to my Google Drive and asks to save to my gmail account 
len ratingone Worked normally after deleting my Google Drive app 
len ratingone Big problem 
len ratingone Just checked update still not fixed 
len ratingone Just checked again still not fixed 
len ratingone Just checked again still not fixed 
len ratingone What is going on 
len ratingfive  Please fix this 
len ratingfive It is annoying to be prompted to update the app over and over 
len ratingfive  Works well on desktop and on mobile
len ratingone The app isn t functionally properly whenever I try to open it the app crashes immediately 
len ratingfive  Easy and succinct 
len ratingfive Links and syncs 
len ratingfive It s perfect all around 
len ratingfive Probably sending all my data to the NSA but it s the cost of free I guess 
len ratingfive  but now Google Drive is my go to Cloud storage solution 
len ratingfive  Super convenient to use 
len ratingfive  It has everything I need right on my phone 
len ratingfive  This is good
len ratingfour  Very good app some limited factors but overall works well and is reliable

len ratingone F U Apple 
len ratingone My next phone will be a Google pixel or a Samsung Note 
len ratingone Start kissing long time customers good bye 
len ratingfour A pesar de tenerlo instalado hace tiempo lo uso poco
len ratingfive  This app keeps getting better 
len ratingfive A must have 
len ratingfive  I love using google drive 
len ratingfive No matter what device I am using it is accessible through all 
len ratingfive The only suggestion I would make on the app is the when you go to shared with me I would an option for folder or document to sort by instead of only by name or last edited 
len ratingfive Just a suggestion but love all the apps that google offers 
len ratingfive I love google drive 
len ratingfive So easy to upload files and clean UI 
len ratingfive  I love the simple functionalities of Google drive 
len ratingone  Usaba mucho esta aplicaci n en mi iPhone s y mi iPad pero ahora ya no puedo realmente son un pena ni modo cambiare a otra nube que brinde un mejor servicio hasta nunca 
len ratingthree Great app that is easy to navigate 
len ratingthree Great way to share info with friends and family 
len ratingthree Would like giving permissions to be a little easier but not enough where I wouldn t promote its use 
len ratingthree I recommend it 
len ratingthree Still keeps asking for update to app but says I need release or later 
len ratingthree I m at 
len ratingthree What gives 
len ratingfive Really useful and straightforward 
len ratingone  Google is discontinuing and offering no help to current errors 
len ratingone I deleted and moved on 
len ratingone Update 
len ratingone Google just sent a bs email 
len ratingone Move on 
len ratingone So far one drive is good 
len ratingone  We re sorry to hear about your frustration 
len ratingone Google Drive is working to make sure your concerns are heard including supporting older versions of iOS 
len ratingone Please stay tuned for updates 
len ratingfive  Its the Best Cloud App 
len ratingfive Thanks a lot 
len ratingthree  Seriously Google 
len ratingthree I don t think you re minding this upgrade 
len ratingthree It s been a few weeks and though I have iOS iPhone after I click upgrade your app tells me I need for this upgrade but it can give me the latest I can use instead 
len ratingthree After trying that times over a few weeks the counter still says I need to upgrade 
len ratingthree Talk about wrong messaging 
len ratingthree Ugh 
len ratingthree Every time I open my phone it tells me I to upgrade but I need the iOS for it which I have 
len ratingthree It s like being subjected to waitstaff that repeatedly asks how s the meal it s annoying and regardless of the quality of the meal you really don t want to go back 
len ratingthree Sad to say it s affected my use of the app I m staying away for the duration til you get your stuff together 
len ratingthree Three stars cause you were fine before even though you lost it with this one 
len ratingfive  I use this app on my phone iPad and laptop daily 
len ratingfive I can even access it from my lame desktop at work 
len ratingfive It is so convenient to have everything I need so easily accessible from literally anywhere 
len ratingfive Life changing 
len ratingone I can t update the app continuously tried several times and no matter what it keeps popping up with a message that I need IOS 
len ratingone Please fix this problem 
len ratingone Really annoying 
len ratingfive Google Drive has been a blessing for my work 
len ratingfive I changed from Android to IOS and the transition has been very smooth due to my documents and files being saved in Drive easy access from anywhere anytime 
len ratingfive  Recomendo muito til para coisas pessoais e trabalho
len ratingfive It s on my phone my iPad windows laptop and chrome book 
len ratingfive If none of these are available swing by any library 
len ratingfive My files everywhere 
len ratingfive Most useful program
len ratingfive Not much else to say
len ratingfive  Dope son
len ratingone This version won t update on my iPhone SE 
len ratingone presents as an update but won t install 
len ratingone Must be time to delete Google Drive 
len ratingfive  Just need to make easier the share it file part sometimes is not compatible with all browser
len ratingfive  Excellent app 
len ratingfive It does everything the desktop version does and looks a lot lot better 
len ratingone  I still own my iPhone which I use everyday 
len ratingone It still works flawlessly now all of sudden it s a ios only app 
len ratingone Imagine that same thing applied to Android 
len ratingone Latest android compatible only 
len ratingone Nobody would use it 
len ratingone Please be decent and fix so it can work with iOS again 
len ratingone  So there s an update apparently 
len ratingone It s stuck 
len ratingone I tap update and the wheel just spins forever and it never downloads 
len ratingone Haven t had a problem with any of my other app updates and never had this problem before 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  Everyone should use this FREE product 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingtwo Right now only PDF is supported 
len ratingtwo Please support more formats like one mentioned in headline 
len ratingtwo Also like YouTube why can t I read my PDF s when I don t have an internet connection directly from my drive app 
len ratingtwo Please avail this facility to users 
len ratingtwo Please also introduce offline functionality like YouTube
len ratingfive  The functionality and versatility of Google Drive is incredible in both Docs and Sheets 
len ratingfive I m hoping for a mobile app version of Drawings but it s great that I can at least view my drawings in Drive 
len ratingfive And it s all free 
len ratingfive Unbelievably good 
len ratingfour  The easiest way to move data to your devices and share with others simple but be careful with providing access 
len ratingfour I d like to see more robust security 
len ratingtwo Have been trying to get the updates for Drive but does not let update for iPad mini first gen guess it s back to one drive 
len ratingfive  My friends and I have shared many projects and documents using this app which the Drive has left readily accessible for us to create and add more 
len ratingfive It s proven very useful and simple to use 
len ratingfive I m glad it is free because it is such a wonderful service
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive Great to save my school work and view anywhere on my phone
len ratingone  Google is discontinuing and offering no help to current errors 
len ratingone I deleted and moved on 
len ratingone  We re sorry to hear about your frustration 
len ratingone Google Drive is working to make sure your concerns are heard including supporting older versions of iOS 
len ratingone Please stay tuned for updates 
len ratingfive Very useful and convenient all my files in one place 
len ratingone  I upload songs that I record and mix for clients and they don t play on iPhone about half the time 
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingfive  It s googlicious
len ratingfive  Everything I needed 
len ratingfive  Lo m ximo estoy subiendo todas las fotos de mi iPhone que no se ve an en PHOTOS ni el iCloud 
len ratingfive Al final podr guardarlas en un archivo en mi Laptop 
len ratingfour  Thank You 
len ratingfive I find drive to be easier to use than Evernote iCloud Dropbox or One Cloud for what I do which is constantly moving stuff from iPhone to computer to other computer because the first one doesn t print back to iPad back to iPhone 
len ratingfive I wish apple could just get along with Microsoft but until He 
len ratingfive Freezes over we ve got Google drive 
len ratingfive I love my drive 
len ratingfive I can write my lecture notes and slides presentations at home and simply access them from classroom computers or my iPad 
len ratingfive I also use it to create and share projects for my small business 
len ratingfive Near clean and efficient
len ratingfive It is such an amazing app 
len ratingfive It has helped and works wonderfully with Google Docs
len ratingfive  I recommend it s fun for The Whole family 
len ratingfive The app newest update is not recognizing the v on my iPad and wants to download an older version of Google Drive then doesn t 
len ratingfive Beautiful wonderful app though 
len ratingfive  Splendid app 
len ratingthree I love Google Drive in spite of its flaws 
len ratingthree It is very easy to use and convenient to have my files available to me anywhere 
len ratingthree I have experienced glitches however 
len ratingthree I have had files moved to different folders and I have lost files 
len ratingthree Actually a file with the same file name exists but it is not the correct file 
len ratingthree This has happened consistently in the same way even when I have re uploaded the correct file 
len ratingfour  I open edit and pass on many files every day so having to rely on email alone would be a tremendous hassle 
len ratingfour Therefore Google Drive is a must a blessing really 
len ratingfour That said though the site is fine the app is not always reliable 
len ratingfive  Works great
len ratingfive  I use this app suite and storage space every day 
len ratingtwo  Photos take forever to load 
len ratingtwo It s not a wifi issue as Dropbox runs much faster compared to Google Drive 
len ratingtwo Always a nuisance to use this app 
len ratingtwo I may move everything over to Dropbox because I m fed up with waiting for my photos documents et cetera to load 
len ratingone  I can t update GoogleDrive keeps telling me that I am unable to do so 
len ratingone My iPad mini is a first generation one that I can t update beyond iOS and this new GoogleDrive apparently isn t able to update because I can t go beyond iOS which makes GoogleDrive pretty useless now 
len ratingone I have a lot stored on it that I will either have to delete or move to another drive but some stuff that I have is specific to GoogleDrive and I still need to use it 
len ratingone So why shut out users of older platforms 
len ratingone What you can t do something to allow US to update anymore 
len ratingone C mon Google not all of us run out and buy the latest gadget every time a new operating system comes out 
len ratingone Some of us like to hang on to our older devices 
len ratingone Get with the program and allow us to update too 
len ratingfive  Highly recommend this app to anyone who shares files regularly 
len ratingfive  I absolutely love Google Drive 
len ratingfive It s the missing piece that connects all of my devices and acts as my internet base station 
len ratingfive I don t know what I d do without it 
len ratingfive Oh it s easy to use too 
len ratingfive Tremenda aplicaci n muy buena y simple de usar
len ratingone How long am I going to get a notification to download an older version 
len ratingone It looks like I have the right iOS 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingfive Been using it for a while it s working great 
len ratingfive Google drive is great cloud drive for sharing 
len ratingfive Five stars
len ratingone Instead of simply asking users whether they want to rate review the app or of course doing nothing at all Google has added an interstitial dialog box 
len ratingone It prompts users whether they like the app or not then sends positive feedback to the App Store and redirects negative feedback to Google where it goes to die 
len ratingone As a result of this intentionally disingenuous UI the ratings here are skewed higher than users actual experiences 
len ratingone Ignore the App Store average 
len ratingone  Thank you for your review 
len ratingone We don t filter feedback at all as you can see 
len ratingone The in app dialog is useful because we don t require users to leave the app to give us feedback which we think is best regardless of whether or not the feedback is positive 
len ratingone Noticeably I could not access the update second time by saying that it is not able to purchase 
len ratingone Fix the bug for the iOS x 
len ratingone Thanks
len ratingone  It doesn t support my iPhone The app should recognize the device model so it won t keep showing that it needs an update 
len ratingone  If you try to open some non Google file types like text files or Word docs in the iOS Files app Google Drive will open and try to make you save the files to your Google account 
len ratingone Not acceptable so I uninstalled 
len ratingone The October update did not fix this 
len ratingfive  Really helpful when it comes to working on my music and getting me the right things
len ratingfour  I love having this app because I can access my records at the swipe of a finger 
len ratingfour What I dislike is that the app doesn t have a password requirement which is why I gave it stars 
len ratingfour Otherwise it s an awesome app 
len ratingfive  Love the app 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  This is an incredible tool for productivity as well as universal access storage for documents images metadata backups 
len ratingfive I can see no reason why anyone would not want to use this tool there is no cost and it works perfectly and has a very small learning curve 
len ratingfive Use it enjoy it be creative you can do it 
len ratingfive  Tener disponible en tu celular todos tus documentos que est n en tu pc es un Plus 
len ratingfive Gracias 
len ratingfive  I absolutely love the google drive app 
len ratingfive The storage capacity for me is amazing 
len ratingfive I love the way you can organize your pictures store AND PLAY MUSIC 
len ratingfive And the suggestions they give you and help is great 
len ratingone  While it says it works with iOS and higher it will only update iOS 
len ratingfive Fantastic app use it every day to sync and transfer data between different platforms 
len ratingfive  Is great to have documents available anywhere and organized 
len ratingfive This app is very convenient when I need to view a document in a pinch and it is very reliable when I keep it updated 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I especially love that whatever I save on the computer or laptop to my drive and it automatically appears on the app 
len ratingfive It s awesome 
len ratingfive Definitely stars from me 
len ratingone  Update STILL HIJACKING FILE OPENING IN FILES APP 
len ratingone Update The app has not been fixed with the latest update and there is nowhere at Google to report bugs 
len ratingone An awful product 
len ratingone Original review Had to delete this app due to its bad behavior 
len ratingone Nasty bug 
len ratingone  I m sorry to hear about your frustration 
len ratingone We re aware of the files app feedback from our users and are looking into possible solutions 
len ratingone Thank you for your review 
len ratingone  Google seems to think they can just run their company on AI and rake in the dollars 
len ratingone The consequence of this is that no humans are actually reading the complaints about the disabled Google Drive support of iPad and iPad 
len ratingone No one is intervening to remedy this because AI simply lacks emotion and does not care about real life human problems 
len ratingone Contrast with Amazon that uses human support that reacts appropriately when customers complain 
len ratingone This simply will not happen with Google AI 
len ratingone As a result a large number of PAYING Google Drive customers are being left in the dark 
len ratingone The only viable choice is to drop Google Drive and move to the less expensive iCloud 
len ratingone Ironically this message will probably not get to you because a human at Apple will likely read this review and deem it inappropriate 
len ratingone However this is to be expected with human support 
len ratingone They REACT unlike Google AI 
len ratingfive  Drive makes everything accessible when you need it most 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingone  Please re add support for iOS x 
len ratingone Even you latest release will not install 
len ratingfive Does what it says it supposed to do with no storage limitations
len ratingfive  Google drive is great and is now a necessity for me and my family
len ratingtwo  What were you thinking and not to update this for days so far 
len ratingtwo I think you ve left a pretty big population in the lurch and with a big unavoidable update reminder on their desktops 
len ratingtwo This is an education issue where your help desk people have tried to pawn it off but surely not only there 
len ratingtwo You miss something morally when you presume to insist people spend hundreds in new hardware 
len ratingtwo Think of nonprofits as well as so many individuals and please do the right publicly responsible thing 
len ratingfive  Really great with creating space on my iPhone Plus GB I have tons of photos from family outings and stuff like that I appreciate google and there team 
len ratingfive Really interested in more apps like this one keep me in the loop 
len ratingfive Thanks guys try it 
len ratingfive  just wow
len ratingone  I thought this would be the one but alas I ll have to delete Drive yet again from my iPad 
len ratingone Google Drive does not properly interact with iOS s native Files app 
len ratingone If you use Files you DO NOT WANT to have Google Drive on your device 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Because all text files and some picture files that you click on in the Files app are opened into the Google Drive 
len ratingone Where we should just get a quick preview or the ability to open the files in another app Google Drive just takes over and tries to copy the file into Drive forcing you to make more digital clutter 
len ratingone And then more often than not the file isn t even correctly copied into Drive 
len ratingone FIX THIS GOOGLE 
len ratingfive  This is a really useful app 
len ratingfive Have tried and compared with several of the other cloud storage services and found this to be easy and very user friendly 
len ratingfive Although I don t store a great amount there I find that this really meets my needs 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfour  This is a good cloud app I just wish it would behave as well on my windows computer 
len ratingone  I see that the iOS requirement was lowered to which is great for some but my device still cannot update the software 
len ratingone Please make this compatible for the iPhone C the fact that I can t update this essential app is absolutely ridiculous 
len ratingfive This turns your iOS device from a toy into a tool
len ratingfive I am a big fan 
len ratingfive I use google drive for many of my personal documents but absolutely love it for leading my PTA 
len ratingfive The ease of storing and sharing files is unbeatable 
len ratingfive It makes a huge difference in our ability to transition roles each year and stay in the loop throughout the year 
len ratingone  When I try to refresh the drive it acts like its sinking my when it s not 
len ratingone nd or rd time it finally does sink 
len ratingfive I absolutely love the Google Drive app 
len ratingfive It is so convenient when I m super busy but need to check or write something down or even share things with others 
len ratingfive I am able to access it whenever I need to and it is reliable 
len ratingthree Hey Google I m glad to see that you have added files integration on iOS 
len ratingthree I am experiencing two fairly big bugs with it though 
len ratingthree When drive is installed anytime I click on a Word document anywhere in files it attempts to open in Google drive 
len ratingthree I m not sure why since I have Microsoft Word installed 
len ratingthree Also I have several google accounts and I am not seeing a way of selecting which one I would like to browse inside of files 
len ratingthree It appears it just uses the last one I opened the drive app and if I want to switch I have to go to the drive app and select a different one there and then come back to the files app 
len ratingthree Why remove support for older devices without leaving them with legacy app support 
len ratingfive Keeps the business running smooth every day 
len ratingfive  I love this service 
len ratingfive Good Work 
len ratingfive  It can do way more then anyone thinks it can
len ratingone People are suffering from this and iOS is a glitchy mess right now don t do this 
len ratingfive  Google Drive works seamlessly for me 
len ratingfive I use it on my Mac PC and iPhone 
len ratingfive Finally is cloud storage user friendly 
len ratingfive I have found this is an easy way to share files 
len ratingfive There is a video of my father which I will be sharing with my children because it was stored on your server which is the closest thing to them seeing him in person 
len ratingfour  I love Google Drive and the entire suite of services 
len ratingfour A couple of months ago I upgraded my storage and got on backup and sync 
len ratingfour A huge reason for this was to have my desktop files accessible remotely 
len ratingfour Well my iPad and iPhone Drive apps showed these at first but after an update to the app there have been several updates since it s gone 
len ratingfour Talked to support and they are aware of the issue but no results 
len ratingfive  I m also with the stunning feat of humanity
len ratingfive  great
len ratingfour  So far so good 
len ratingfive I have only had the drive for a month now I use it to share photos with my international friends and I have no issues at this time 
len ratingfive Let s hope it stays that way 
len ratingtwo My iPhone is running iOS and yet the app just won t update 
len ratingtwo Even after I deleted it and reinstalled it 
len ratingtwo The app refuses to update 
len ratingtwo The situation has not changed 
len ratingtwo I tried updating the app and still nothing has changed since the of September 
len ratingtwo Please fix thank you 
len ratingtwo You are Google you got this 
len ratingthree  I have an iPad th generation that will not update to iOS 
len ratingthree Sept th update 
len ratingthree The google drive app continuously tries to update to be compatible with iOS 
len ratingthree It will not update due to iOS 
len ratingthree A fix to not update and or recognize it can not update would be nice 
len ratingthree New update came out on Oct 
len ratingthree App attempted to update but stuck in update mode due to iOS 
len ratingthree No other app does this 
len ratingthree They recognizes it can not update and the updates stop 
len ratingone  Terrific app but if you can t upgrade your thousands of devices and rely on Google Drive to submit assignments good luck retracting everyone a workaround 
len ratingone  Huge security problem 
len ratingone When I attempt to open a file from my iPad or iPhone it immediately diverts to my Google Drive and asks to save to my gmail account 
len ratingone Worked normally after deleting my Google Drive app 
len ratingone Big problem 
len ratingone Just checked update still not fixed 
len ratingone Just checked again still not fixed 
len ratingfive  This app is very easy to use 
len ratingone It keeps show an update sign 
len ratingone Even if your iPad can t upgrade to iOS anymore 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingone Constantly shows Update Available Do I want to install the version I already have 
len ratingone Do I want to install the version I already have 
len ratingone Do I want to install the version I already have 
len ratingone Do I want to install the version I already have 
len ratingone Get a Clue Yet 
len ratingfive  My top app for accessing info anywhere anytime 
len ratingfive Love Drive 
len ratingone  The latest update requires that you have at least or later version which I already have 
len ratingone I m using an iPad mini nd gen and it still won t update instead I get this continuous message The current version requires IOS or later but you can download the last compatible version 
len ratingone Apple please fix this glitch 
len ratingfive This app is so well integrated into iOS it has helped me run my business via mobile devices without issue always 
len ratingfive Please don t get rid of it or stop supporting it Google 
len ratingfive DON T BE EVIL 
len ratingfive Best usage is keeping copies of receipts of items I ve purchased for verification tax filings business reimbursement etc 
len ratingfour  The app says I must have iOS on my iPad before I can upgrade but I HAVE 
len ratingfour Aside from that I like it 
len ratingfive It s great only one I trust my pictures with it s been super I got over pictures I trust them with
len ratingone  I have in app ratings begging turned off in iOS but your app begged anyway 
len ratingone Therefore here s your star rating 
len ratingfive  Love this app
len ratingfive  Everything in one place share what you want with who you want simple to use what more do I need to say except Get it 
len ratingfive You won t be sorry 
len ratingfive  It works
len ratingthree  It seems they dropped support for the first generation iPad mini 
len ratingthree Why 
len ratingthree It used to be a now a 
len ratingfive Really convenient 
len ratingfive Wonderful tool for access to any place working 
len ratingfive  I use Google Drive for work and home 
len ratingfive I think it s a wonderful tool to have 
len ratingfive For work I am able to share documents and control who has the ability to edit 
len ratingfive For my home use I am able to share pictures with family and friends so they are able to download and print any they like 
len ratingfive  Works perfectly 
len ratingone  How turn to version 
len ratingone Or adopted for iOS please 
len ratingfive Frankly I can t live without it 
len ratingfive Haven t found anything better 
len ratingfive It would be nice is Sheets we re integrated 
len ratingone Wha the Frak 
len ratingone UPDATE Stop telling me I need at least when I already have it 
len ratingone Your compatibility list doesn t list iPad th gen then you need to tell me that instead of which iOS I need since yours said iOS 
len ratingone So Frak that 
len ratingone Deleting this app from this iPad 
len ratingone Frak you 
len ratingfive This is basically the only way I can see my granddaughter grow up so far away 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfour  Works very well and fast 
len ratingfive  Every day use 
len ratingfive And everything works 
len ratingfive This is a great app in seconds all my pics from my phone are on my ipad No transfer vile SD card anymore 
len ratingone  Slow and unreliable
len ratingfive  Love how easy it is when you are on the go 
len ratingfive It s definitely a keeper 
len ratingfive  I am glad that I can use Google drive on iPhone 
len ratingfive It is the best
len ratingfive  Need I say more 
len ratingone  Latest version uploads my photos to drive even though I have the auto backup photos option set to off 
len ratingone I had to delete the app to get it to stop 
len ratingthree  I love this app but there are two things I d like fixed 
len ratingthree I d also appreciate if I could learn if I m doing something wrong 
len ratingthree First whenever I open a document and I have audio playing phone speaker AirPods Bluetooth speaker the audio pauses 
len ratingthree Second I have the app and document open and everything is great 
len ratingthree When I switch to another app temporary and go back to google drive the document I had open is closed and I m back on the main page 
len ratingfive  Everything available on my iPhone whenever I want 
len ratingfive  The level of ingenuity demonstrated by this company as exemplified by this app is phenomenal 
len ratingone  It s critical to my work to be able to tell what folder a file 
len ratingone This basic feature is missing or very well hidden 
len ratingfive  This is a must have for all It is user friendly intuitive and very well designed I ve been using the drive for over year and many of my important files are backed up on the drive 
len ratingfive  google drive is the best thing that i have ever found 
len ratingfive at first i only used it for assignments but now in my free time i like to search the app for fun things to do 
len ratingfive if i didn t find the app i would have to take time out of my day to use the computer or another device 
len ratingfive thanks google 
len ratingfive Your friend Frances
len ratingone I can t afford to get a new iPad so I have to continue using my year old iPad but I can t update this app because it says it isn t compatible with my iPad anymore 
len ratingone Make this compatible with my iPad please 
len ratingone I love using Drive for writing stories between my computer and mobile 
len ratingone Please be fair to the poor people who can t afford dollar tablets 
len ratingfive  Awesome
len ratingfive  I really enjoy the functions of this device 
len ratingfive From storage to sharing it works perfectly 
len ratingfive  It is really easy to access my documents and to print them when I need to however I wish they kept the same format of the word documents 
len ratingfive  I have several projects that I work on 
len ratingfive I primarily use my desktop 
len ratingfive But when I am in a waiting line somewhere or have a few moments Google Drive on my iPhone has s the perfect solution 
len ratingfive Keeps my docs in sync and is super easy to use 
len ratingfive And it s free 
len ratingone  mb 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Access you files from any platform 
len ratingfive A much needed tool 
len ratingtwo  It works well sometimes but other times nothing will work 
len ratingtwo Half the time it will just refuse to save a video or photo 
len ratingtwo It will prepare to export and then stop and that s it 
len ratingtwo This is very annoying because sometimes I have a deadline and I upload the video on the computer and I can t get it on my phone 
len ratingtwo Other than that it works okay 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Very nice app that adjusts nicely to all sorts of connectivity issues 
len ratingfive Nice job Google 
len ratingone This latest version continues to prompt me for an update 
len ratingone The prompt says it needs which I have 
len ratingone I choose to download the older version and still the update badge appears 
len ratingone Liked using the app but this is very irritating and I will likely just uninstall 
len ratingfive  I really like Drive because it helps me to keep files documents spreadsheets etc within easy reach 
len ratingfive And especially on my mobile device 
len ratingfive  Has worked great for me
len ratingfive  Es una aplicaci n muy til no cuenta con errores y facilita el trabajo ya que puedes tener tus documentos en la facilidad de tu dispositivo m vil 
len ratingfive  Estupendo 
len ratingone  Cannot update the app on iOS 
len ratingfive We use drive for storing an making videos 
len ratingfive It s the best 
len ratingfive  Frustrated with the step verification
len ratingfive Nice cross platform features and abilities 
len ratingfive Saves me an extra pain in my arse and that s always welcome 
len ratingfive Cheers 
len ratingfive  Very easy to use 
len ratingfive Can access files from all of my google and iOS devices 
len ratingfour  Where I keep all the nudes I get
len ratingthree  This is a good app but the latest version perpetually warns that it can only be installed on iOS or later 
len ratingthree My phone runs so please fix the app and work on improving quality assurance and testing procedures 
len ratingfive  I needed a way to store all my photos taken for my photography club and this saved my life 
len ratingone  The description says it requires iOS then when you say update it says it needs newer 
len ratingone Then you DL it again and again 
len ratingone Enough is enough 
len ratingone I m deleting it 
len ratingfive The app is great 
len ratingfive It lets you take your files everywhere you go 
len ratingfive  As a Google for work company we live on Drive and the associated apps 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone It s ridiculous that Google doesn t make standalone apps 
len ratingone In order to use Drive to its fullest capacity you have to also have the Docs app and the Sheets app and the Slides app 
len ratingone It s not a difficult programming job to combine the apps to make a more user friendly interface but Google refuses to do that for their users and that s ridiculous 
len ratingfive  As usual google products are the best
len ratingfive  I m currently a student and this has been a life saver 
len ratingfive I can turn my papers in without having to get on a computer or laptop 
len ratingfive No more late papers for me 
len ratingfour It is a great app for uploading sensitive documents at a moment s notice 
len ratingfour It is quite a large app though 
len ratingfive Light strong no bugs perfect 
len ratingone Get error message on iPad to update to or download an old version but I m running 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive  why 
len ratingthree  Please make Google drive safer an more secure by adding a lock code an unlocking it by using fingerprint it s the only great feature it s lacking Thanks
len ratingfour  This is good and easy cloud service 
len ratingfive Easy to access across multiple devices
len ratingfive  I love this it is amazing to have everything with me at the tap of a button no more carrying multiple flash drives 
len ratingfive  I had used drive for a few years and I love it 
len ratingfive I recommend to everyone
len ratingfive  Good App
len ratingtwo  Half the time appear offline documents won t load 
len ratingtwo You do get a good amount of storage for a free account 
len ratingone Now I m forced to delete because I m too ADD to see a push notification sitting there
len ratingone  I have an iPad mini first gen and I ve been using the Google Drive app for the past few years and it s been working great 
len ratingone Then all of a sudden it says I need an update which is usually not an issue except this time Google requires iOS for the update which I cannot get 
len ratingone Now I m stuck with an app that can t update and an annoying notification showing that I have an app that needs to be updated 
len ratingone Also every time I update other apps it gives me a notification letting me know that Google Drive can t update 
len ratingone Seems like an error that a small company might make when updating apps but not a company like Google
len ratingone  Every time I hit the update button it says that this app is not compatible with my iPad 
len ratingone The only problem is that s clearly not true because it s already on my iPad to begin with 
len ratingfive  As always Google stood apart in making and offering products to common man to improve he life s for free 
len ratingfive  It a pretty good app I give it star
len ratingfive I can get to all my files from any device and share them as necessary 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingthree  Because i have to get each separate app in order to edit my documents which is annoying why can t you just let me edit it in the one app 
len ratingthree Please please for the love of God let me edit my documents on my phone 
len ratingthree It would save me a lot of time 
len ratingthree Otherwise the app is fine for looking at my documents without editing them
len ratingfive  Super easy format and makes managing files between my mobile and my laptop absolutely seamless
len ratingone  Add support for 
len ratingfive  Exactly like the title does what it says
len ratingtwo  Why can t an app that worked well for a year update for IOS 
len ratingtwo Now I have to downgrade to go with an upgrade 
len ratingtwo Sounds pretty inconsistent to me 
len ratingone As others have noted this version of the app is being incorrectly presented to devices that it no longer lists as supported 
len ratingone This also means that if the app is deleted older devices can never install the previous still functional version from the App Store 
len ratingone This is a Google side app deployment issue 
len ratingone The Google Drive iOS forum has dozens of posts about this issue and how several mass education deployments now have thousands of students each without Drive access 
len ratingone It would be interesting to find out what aspect of Google Drive is so critically dependent on iOS and bit that the previous functional version cannot remain available to iPad and previous iPhones 
len ratingone Until then every one of these devices with the previous version of the app installed will have a permanent pending update shown in the App Store app with a notification flag that can never be cleared 
len ratingone  Constantly shows Update Available 
len ratingone Should not offer an update and then say the update cannot be performed on iPhone using 
len ratingfive  Photos don t count against storage limit 
len ratingfive  It really is easy and convenient
len ratingtwo It keeps crashings while I upload the pics 
len ratingtwo All the time 
len ratingtwo If I upload about more than pics at once it crashes 
len ratingtwo Annoying as hell 
len ratingtwo  When I download something for offline viewing it doesn t work 
len ratingtwo Very inconvenient since I m not always at wifi 
len ratingtwo Big inconvenience even if it s a gigabyte it shouldn t just not work at all when I m playing it offline when it works online without it being downloaded 
len ratingfive Two thumbs up from me each from John Paul and George and one from Ringo 
len ratingone Can t select multiple files and then copy them somewhere else 
len ratingone Can only move them 
len ratingone C mon dudes 
len ratingone  If you try to open some non Google file types like text files or Word docs in the iOS Files app Google Drive will open and try to make you save the files to your Google account 
len ratingone Not acceptable so I uninstalled 
len ratingfive  Works so well on different platforms windows iPhone Chromebook etc 
len ratingfive Thanks the google drive 
len ratingfive  Love how easy it is to synchronize documents from computer to app
len ratingfive Excelente confiable
len ratingfive  This app can be relied upon and just works 
len ratingfive It will simplify your life by making your content available to you anywhere 
len ratingone  Crashes constantly my favorited folders keep disappearing shows the wrong folder counts no document or image previews pathetic release 
len ratingfour  Intuitive and easy way to share collaborate on files with my team 
len ratingone I am having the same issue others are describing with the app saying it requires iOS which I have but then it downloads an earlier version and continually shows up as needing an update 
len ratingone Would give a higher score if this issue was fixed 
len ratingone  Will not update with iPhone s
len ratingfive Love I can view edit share what I need whenever I need on the go no matter where I m at 
len ratingfive  I don t know what I would do without this App 
len ratingfive Love love
len ratingfive  I love google drive it is so helpful
len ratingfive  Really fantastic software love it 
len ratingfive Absolutely love it and use it all the time 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone  If you try to open some non Google file types like text files or Word docs in the iOS Files app Google Drive will open and try to make you save the files to your Google account 
len ratingone Not acceptable so I uninstalled 
len ratingthree  This version refuses to install on iOS or as a device based VPP app pushed by our MDM AirWatch 
len ratingone Last version don t compatible with my iPad IOS but proposed for update 
len ratingfive  All is said in the title 
len ratingfive Would recommend
len ratingfive  Works
len ratingfive  I ve had a Google Drive account for two years now I use it for a lot of different things 
len ratingfive It s great to be able to have an app based interface 
len ratingfive Makes it simple and quick to connect can use For content on my Google Drive 
len ratingfive Before I install the app I would have to open Safari and then go through the process of signing in 
len ratingfive I don t have to do that anymore
len ratingfive Google Drive gets better all the time 
len ratingfive I can access documents from my iPhone iPad and computer and other computers as well 
len ratingfive Easy to print documents to my wireless printer 
len ratingfive Super easy to use 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive  Nice work
len ratingfive Works well
len ratingfive  I ve used this for years while I was teaching and I still do 
len ratingfive I have tons of stuff in these tools 
len ratingfive The only thing that bothers me is that when I m on my Mac and attach a Google doc in an email or message it always opens in Pages which messes up the format 
len ratingfive Not Drive s fault so I live with and work around it 
len ratingfour  This is a very useful App and helps me access many of my files via my iPhone when I m away from my DeskTop 
len ratingfour You will like it 
len ratingfive Best app
len ratingfour  Also useful for moving files on and off networks and for collaboration with others
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I can get to all my pictures and documents from any device I m on plus it saves room on my devices that s HEAVEN 
len ratingfive This app helps keep me organized because I don t have to remember where I saved that one document I can get to it from anywhere 
len ratingfive LOVE 
len ratingfive Happy with it
len ratingone  Once each day for the last week the iPad Store app updater has alerted me to update the Google Drive app 
len ratingone The problem is either with Google or with Apple though I suspect it s a combination of the Apple OS and Google Drive being incompatible 
len ratingone In Steve Jobs words it s misbehaving software 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone I don t like having to download the same software over and over especially when I don t really use it 
len ratingone Unloading deleting the app is not an option since it seems to be required for use of Google Maps and other apps 
len ratingfive Saved me from PURCHASING more I cloud
len ratingfive  Great app to store all files 
len ratingthree  I have had to run this update times today so far 
len ratingthree My iPad runs iOS 
len ratingthree I checked what Drive version it puts me back to and it s ver Every time I have to update apps on my iPad Google Drive is in the list 
len ratingthree I get a message it cannot update to latest version and asks if I want to download the last version available for my iPad th generation which is 
len ratingthree Can t you fix this problem or make it compatible for the latest version update 
len ratingthree I love the options the app gives me but the constant redownload of iOS version is ridiculous when I have other apps updating several times a day as they are released 
len ratingfive  Awesome
len ratingtwo I love Google Drive on its own 
len ratingtwo I use it for work no choice 
len ratingtwo But it renders the new ios Files app worthless because it hijacks all Word Excel PowerPoint and text files from other apps 
len ratingtwo I use OneDrive for personal files and I use Dropbox as backup for a specific app no choice and I cannot open files in the OneDrive or Dropbox locations in the Files App because Google Drive hijacks them 
len ratingtwo Asks me if I want to save the file to GoogleDrive and even though I definitely don t want to it won t actually save it even if you try 
len ratingtwo So GoogleDrive has rendered the Files App worthless to me 
len ratingtwo THANKS 
len ratingfive  This is a fantastic app for productivity 
len ratingfive Well done Google 
len ratingfive  Todo en un solo lugar 
len ratingfive Con acceso desde cualquier parte donde te encuentres 
len ratingfive  I really enjoy this app
len ratingfive  Easy to use 
len ratingfive Highly accessible 
len ratingfive great for sharing
len ratingfive  Incredibly convenient to use 
len ratingfive It saves me a lot of time 
len ratingfive I can store and access a lot of files 
len ratingfive Will continue to use and I will recommend to others
len ratingfive  Heaps 
len ratingfive  Wonderful one of the most incredibly versatile programs that one could ever ask for 
len ratingfive With Google Drive YOU have that ability to not only save and protect your images and share them if you wish BUT you may also save Google Sheets 
len ratingfive Notes and much much more 
len ratingfive This program saves your metadata from your images perfectly 
len ratingfive For those who may not be familiar with metadata date created date modified size of file location of image and in some apps such as ProCamera can actually show you from which compass point you were pointing the camera when said image was taken 
len ratingfive And this actually works 
len ratingfive All to often whence an image is copied to a program an app or another device or drive this valuable metadata is lost and you simply see date created today 
len ratingfive Even if the image was taken years ago 
len ratingfive A truly remarkable application 
len ratingfive Definitely DagNabbitRabbit Approved
len ratingone  I had to delete Google Drive as it would hijack all of my cloud drives and force open pdf and docx files 
len ratingone For example opening a PDF in Files from iCloud Drive forces Google Drive to open asking if I want to save it to Google Drive 
len ratingone Only way to solve this issue is deleting Google Drive completely 
len ratingfive  Ever since I use Google Drive I have stopped carrying the pen drives so the important files are always with me 
len ratingfive I also don t need MS office to quickly create and share documents sheets etc This is just awesome 
len ratingfour  Google Drive is a great tool that facilitates work and play 
len ratingfour Highly recommend it 
len ratingfour This app is great but it be pausing at random times sometimes
len ratingfive  I d be lost without it 
len ratingfive This is a must have app on any platform you use 
len ratingfive  Use it with all of my school stuff
len ratingthree  I only wrote this because I wanted it to stop telling me to rate
len ratingfive  Share everything
len ratingfive Google has helped me greatly with my academic needs 
len ratingfive Instead of carrying all my papers all over the place google drive has features that allows me to work on my phone wherever I am allowing me to be much more productive
len ratingfive I really enjoy the app 
len ratingfive Easy to organize and find files 
len ratingone  Problems in the package cause MDMs to not install this version 
len ratingone I suspect it has something to do with requiring the next iOS software to get the new version 
len ratingone In other words I think there is an iOS version requirement mismatch 
len ratingone Even effects and iPad hardware
len ratingfive It s as simple as that
len ratingfive  Helps me gather my files and folder in one location 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and more secure 
len ratingfive I m with the gentleman who wrote the stunning feat of humanity review therutabega 
len ratingfive I am a technical writer editor and I ve seen many word processing programs operating systems and storage options 
len ratingfive This is simply the best at all three 
len ratingfive He mentioned no more thumb drives Remember all those contortions to remotely get past a firewall 
len ratingfive Remember syncing Maybe I m just easily impressed but I still marvel at how many of us walk around with a thin pocket sized device that serves as a computer camera calendar gaming system clock bookshelf news source shopping mall high definition tv stereo music system and oh yeah a phone 
len ratingfive In any event Google Drive makes it a great deal easier to access and integrate many of these functions 
len ratingfive What will they think of next 
len ratingfive  Very useful apps
len ratingfive  The Google Suite is amazing 
len ratingfive It s made work much better 
len ratingfive Please stop asking me to write a review 
len ratingfive The only change I d ask is that from tech company to tech company these programs and apps should not get in the way of each other 
len ratingfive I m a teacher and it s further proof of latestage capitalism that companies are trying to make money off of education 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingthree  IPhone is showing update for iOS 
len ratingthree But doesn t have iOS update 
len ratingthree Update getting failed 
len ratingfive  Working properly with updates 
len ratingfive I Wrote Can t update on older devices even though constantly bugging user that an update is available 
len ratingfive Google you get us on board with Android apps that you then fail to support on older devices 
len ratingfive Sounds more like Apple practice than Google 
len ratingfive Can you at least offer a work around 
len ratingfive And low and behold a working version appeared 
len ratingfive Great job Google 
len ratingfive  Wouldn t be able to live without 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive  Excellent to back up and share documents
len ratingfive  Slick app for cloud based documents and files
len ratingtwo  Can t even use the Files app now since Drive insists on opening every file I tap 
len ratingfour  I use google drive often and it is convenient to access files from anywhere and anytime 
len ratingone  I am having the same issues as other people 
len ratingone Requires iOS update 
len ratingone Says it will load later updates once it loads seems okay and then requires an update the next day with same issue 
len ratingone Please get this fixed 
len ratingtwo I used pages numbers and keynote by Apple 
len ratingtwo I save these files in my google drive 
len ratingtwo When I go to access these files on the phone the corresponding app should launch 
len ratingtwo Instead I get an error that these are unsupported file types 
len ratingtwo  Why do I keep getting a must have iOS 
len ratingtwo Do you want to download an older version message when I have iOS 
len ratingtwo I could see a message saying my iPhone can t take the update but I have the correct iOS 
len ratingfive  i m a student and this is one of the best most useful thing ever 
len ratingfive it saves all of you re work the second you do it and you can send your work to anyone who has an email 
len ratingfive this is such a life saver 
len ratingfour  Love it
len ratingfive  Best app ever very convenient handy
len ratingfive  Worth it
len ratingone You removed the download option 
len ratingone When you click Open in another app it doesn t give you the option to save into camera roll 
len ratingone Ok 
len ratingone I get it 
len ratingone My iPad is no longer compatible with the latest update 
len ratingone So either stop reminding me about it or make an update compatible with my iOS 
len ratingone This is annoying 
len ratingtwo  It says I have an update but when I try it say IOS is required and do I want to upgrade to the newest compatible version 
len ratingtwo I HAVE 
len ratingone It s pretty crappy when a company as big as Google rolls over to other companies but screws its paying customers 
len ratingone I cannot upgrade Google Drive on my iPad IOS because I don t have a bit device 
len ratingone How lame is that 
len ratingone UNIX and Windows are backwards compatible on their platforms and Dropbox had no problems updating 
len ratingone Maybe I should pay Dropbox for extra storage 
len ratingfive  It s a great app to manage all my documents and pictures 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive  As the saying goes Really couldn t live without it 
len ratingfive  great app 
len ratingfive  Muy util y s per f cil de usar y el almacenamiento es muy bueno 
len ratingfive  Generally speaking great app 
len ratingfive Something unexpected taking photos of documents from within the app 
len ratingfive Drive is easily accessible and is a good way to keep our important information with you all the time Thanks for technology
len ratingfive  How else does one reminisce by scrolling through almost years worth of pictures until they get swallowed up in their own nostalgic existence 
len ratingfive Thanks to google drive This is a thing 
len ratingfive But I do love it 
len ratingfive Brilliant 
len ratingone  It doesn t support my iPhone 
len ratingone Make compatible for earlier version of iOS 
len ratingone Store says the update is for iOS and up 
len ratingone I have and I can force a download 
len ratingone Then next time it does it again 
len ratingone I have tried to update Google Drive multiple times 
len ratingone I don t use it for much so I am ready to delete it 
len ratingone  It is not compatible with my iPhone s and I believe you can tell I have an iPhone s so stop notifying me about it 
len ratingone App requirements say latest version supports but App Store won t download latest to my phone or iPad both of which are running 
len ratingthree  Every folder shows that there is only one item even though there is more 
len ratingfour  Thanks for making this app 
len ratingfive  I use it in my work as a teacher 
len ratingfive I m very grateful for this apps And I suggest that they give us more space 
len ratingfive I love this 
len ratingfive Scan everything so I have a document safe from getting lost or destroyed 
len ratingfive  Google drive has been super easy to use in sharing and editing my docs videos and audio 
len ratingone  No longer updates on an old iPad 
len ratingone Are you trying to turn old but still functional iPads into bricks 
len ratingfive  Handy tool I use frequently 
len ratingfive  I m constantly in meetings all over the city and this apps allows me to search for edit and respond to all of my professional shared documents 
len ratingfour I like it
len ratingfive  Very user friendly and very stable 
len ratingfive I ve been using it for years and it s still storing my files 
len ratingfive The great thing is you can access your files from any internet connection 
len ratingfour  Like the integration with iOS 
len ratingfour Missing the drag drop feature
len ratingfour The app has been better sense the updates good job google 
len ratingthree The extremely sycophantic adulatory reviews are nauseating 
len ratingthree How difficult is it to state your experience matter of factly 
len ratingthree That said I cannot update to the latest version 
len ratingthree I downloaded and installed the latest one times and it comes back to an update status 
len ratingthree When I start to update it says I need iOS or later 
len ratingthree I have an iPhone on iOS 
len ratingthree  Yes old phone but works smashingly 
len ratingthree Google Drive has no pointer to this problem anywhere 
len ratingfive Hace mi vida mucho m s sencilla 
len ratingfive Simplemente la mejor nube 
len ratingfive Drive app in my iPad keep showing installing since days 
len ratingfive But it works in iPhone 
len ratingfive What should I do 
len ratingone This no longer updates on my nd gen iPad Pro 
len ratingone I use it and almost all of the other Google suite daily and the inability to access this in my tablet is infuriating 
len ratingone I now fear that other apps will do the same and this expensive piece of equipment will become redundant 
len ratingone  Why not support iPhone 
len ratingfive  All my things in one workable app 
len ratingfive Thanks google
len ratingone  Please re add support for iOS x 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingone  New version will not install on my iPad 
len ratingone Error message says iOS is needed 
len ratingone But IS installed 
len ratingone The notification will not go away 
len ratingone  Please fix 
len ratingone Thanks
len ratingfive  Walk don t run and download this app 
len ratingfive It has made saving and sharing anything so much easier 
len ratingfive Also download google photos while you re at it 
len ratingfive You won t be disappointed 
len ratingthree The updates require version which I have however it won t update on my phone because it says it needs 
len ratingthree The weather channel does the same thing 
len ratingone Application says needs updating but doesn t work with current version of iOS 
len ratingone Not sure if this an Apple or Google fail but somebody screwed up 
len ratingfive Work great every time I use this app
len ratingone Keeps telling me that it needs OS or later to download 
len ratingone That is the OS I have please fix this bug 
len ratingfive  Like I said this app is so useful to me 
len ratingfive I use it daily for many projects and for accessibility to digital tool kits like Photoshop brushes ArtRage tool presets and much more 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Please don t ever become an evil scary overlord 
len ratingfive I increased my Drive storage because it was the best option to use when sharing pics and videos with family friends or coworkers 
len ratingfive The link sharing option is perfect for directing someone to a file or folder very quickly 
len ratingfive I also love the ability for the PC app to provide seamless and continuous file syncing 
len ratingfour  Useful
len ratingone  Again the update is excluding phones based on age not on the iOS version 
len ratingone It says required but my phone is running but because it is not on the specific device list it will not update as it should 
len ratingfive  Works well
len ratingfive Love the service and product
len ratingfive I can not do anyone my work if I don t have Google drive App on my phone 
len ratingtwo My first app review was inspired by frustration 
len ratingtwo Google Drive has always been more clunky than Dropbox 
len ratingtwo Uploading and moving files around is so much easier on Dropbox 
len ratingtwo NOW to top it off the recent update is not compatible with my iPad the iPad I was told would always be compatible with updates 
len ratingtwo I m a scenic designer and use these file sharing platforms a lot 
len ratingtwo Guess I ll be asking our teams to stick with Dropbox 
len ratingtwo Nice job Google 
len ratingfour  The only thing that is missing is a useable search function 
len ratingfour It would be wonderful to search by name date anything other than just file type 
len ratingfour We use Google Drive at work and I can t really find anything on this when we have Sheets files 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone There are thousands possibly s of thousands of iPad th gen out there being used by students 
len ratingone My kid s school is all google classroom and google products 
len ratingone No support for this makes her life a whole more difficult 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingfive  Use it frequently in meetings on my iPhone instead of the crappy Dell laptop my district issues 
len ratingfive I LIVE GOOGLE DRIVE LOL
len ratingfive  I like google drive because I can save so much information 
len ratingfive  I ve been pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to view documents on a phone or pad 
len ratingone The older version didn t have this issue now that every time I save a photo from Drive it compresses it and the quality is significantly reduced 
len ratingone I can t believe no one else has noticed this issue
len ratingthree  Lately my google drive has been crashing every time I open a file 
len ratingthree Not sure what s going on here 
len ratingthree Other than that I love the extra storage space for work docs
len ratingfour Good little app 
len ratingfour Use it all the time 
len ratingfive But could you considering to add the feature that can select all the photos videos in the folder 
len ratingfive When we tried to add the photos we have no choice but to select one by one 
len ratingfive  PDFsharing for on the go reading and homework
len ratingtwo  La aplicaci n no se encuentra el idioma espa ol solo ingl s antes se encontraba con el idioma hasta la ltima actualizaci n
len ratingfive i love you google drive
len ratingone  Videos can t be air played to Apple TV anymore 
len ratingone It just keeps trying and failing
len ratingfive  It s a good app true to its PC version helpful and easy to use
len ratingfour This is a great app 
len ratingfour It is very helpful and easy to use 
len ratingfour However is there any way you can make it compatible with iPod touch th generation 
len ratingfour I would like to continue using the device but it will no longer update 
len ratingfour If there is way you can do this that would be great 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive I ve been using it for some time now and absolutely love it 
len ratingfive It s brilliant
len ratingfour Easy to use 
len ratingfour Syncs quickly with my other devices 
len ratingfour Lay out is appealing 
len ratingfive  All my data is secured 
len ratingfive My partner 
len ratingfive  What can I say I have access to my files of all types across all devices and all platforms 
len ratingfive Works like it should
len ratingfive  Google drive for iOS does a great job of providing access to your files on the go 
len ratingfive It works for many things from spreadsheets for kids allowance too quick access to years of family photos 
len ratingfive I can share files and directories with friends 
len ratingfive This won t replace your desktop but it provides excellent mobile access to your files 
len ratingfive  Great for backing up pictures

len ratingtwo  This has been a great product for many years 
len ratingtwo It is disappointing that the newest update 
len ratingtwo Will not download into my I pad 
len ratingtwo It is sad that Google appears to be throwing people with I pads a few years old under the bus 
len ratingtwo Please fix this or quit sending me update notifications that I can t download 
len ratingone  I guess this is Google s attempt to bring fragmentation to iOS 
len ratingone It appears the geniuses at Google that their innovations in completely fragmenting the Android platform were lacking iOS so they decided to make Google Drive incompatible with fully functional earlier devices 
len ratingone Brilliant 
len ratingone Now this means my iOS device can be just as incompatible as one Android device is to another Android device 
len ratingone WOW 
len ratingone I m ECSTATIC to FINALLY have the Android experience on my iPad 
len ratingone THANK YOU GOOGLE 
len ratingone Bravo 
len ratingone ONE STAR 
len ratingfive I use this daily for everything 
len ratingfive Love the ease of access and customization 
len ratingtwo  This app is not compatible so this all is not much use to me 
len ratingfive  I love the option to share files 
len ratingfive It helps with business and personal life 
len ratingfive Keeps getting better 
len ratingone I use backup and sync to access my laptop s files remotely and the main feature I was planning on using drive for isn t available 
len ratingone There is no computers tab on the mobile app 
len ratingone What gives 
len ratingfive This app worked perfectly for me 
len ratingfive Easy to interface with 
len ratingfive  Nice
len ratingfive  Really like it
len ratingone  Fix your app google 
len ratingone Your latest update from insists it wants iOS Ipad th gen is on 
len ratingone Wants to update to some previous version
len ratingfive  I love everything about Drive 
len ratingfive It s the best thing since the invention of the printing press 
len ratingfive  Love the way it works on my PC works flawlessly on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Having finger recognition on iPhone makes access to files fast 
len ratingfive Always works great no issues
len ratingone  It seems they dropped support for the first generation iPad mini 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingfour Overall this app makes college much much easier 
len ratingfour My only problem is if I delete or read a notification on my computer it doesn t sync up to my phone 
len ratingfour Otherwise I LOVEEEEE it 
len ratingfour Very smooth easy quick and helpful 
len ratingfive  one of the best sorry google drive is the best 
len ratingfour I use it for sharing and backing up files
len ratingfive Film vacations drone video family gatherings and pretty much anything on your iPhone or android phone 
len ratingfive Then easily convert those videos or photos to the Google Drive 
len ratingfive A minute video will probably take about to minutes to load but then you ll have it forever 
len ratingfive The process with this app is frighteningly simple even a year old can do it 
len ratingfive Very happy with it glad I got it so will you 
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingfive Easy to use bridges into multiple google products 
len ratingfive Take a doc from an email attach it to your google calendar everything is ready for your meeting 
len ratingfive All your work docs or pics in one place 
len ratingfive For me it s been a game changer 
len ratingone Seriously google 
len ratingone I am unable to update my first GEN iPad mini and I have the latest iOS and now all of a sudden it s saying it requires iOS are you freaking kidding me 
len ratingone so I went back to the App Store and checked what version of iOS is required and it says you need iOS so why is the new update saying that it requires iOS that s bull crap that is one major error come on Google you need to fix this bug ASAP right now I use Google drive all the time for work and this update is preventing me from accessing very important files and the only way for me to access these files I have to use my iPhone because since it is updated to iOS but not my dear old first GEN iPad mini this needs to be fixed Google because it is causing compatibility issues with a lot of older Gen iOS devices and I swear if I lose my job I will seriously sue Google for this bull crap 
len ratingfive  Very useful
len ratingone  Had to delete the Google Drive app because the App Store keeps alerting me that there is a new version to download 
len ratingone Except this version requires iOS which I don t and won t have 
len ratingone This should be fine because the App Store has the ability to see that I have iOS so it skips the iOS required updates after a few comfirming clicks 
len ratingone But this is not the case with Google Drive 
len ratingone It tells me the update is there I try to download it it tells me I only have iOS so it downloads the last iOS version then the cycle starts over again 
len ratingone It rediculous because I ve re downloaded the same iOS version of the app four times before I realized what was happening 
len ratingone I m sure this is a flaw of this particular app and they way the comptible versions are listed in the app store because I have not had this problem with any other app which has an iOS only version 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  I m not sure how other people use this app but whenever I buy tickets to events I can save them on this drive and access them much more easily when I get to the venue 
len ratingfive It s my new favorite app 
len ratingone  Upset that I can t update this app with my iPad 
len ratingone I guess I ll have to move everything to Dropbox 
len ratingfive Love it use it daily
len ratingfive  I think I have finally made the decision to convert from a decade of Apple over to Google 
len ratingfive Their products like drive simply work better when it comes to integration 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I can view most of my files and it s to save files to it
len ratingone Loved it until I went to update it and it no longer worked on my work iPad 
len ratingone Frustrated since we use Google Drive for a LOT of stuff 
len ratingfour  Very best
len ratingfive I ve used this as a secure folder for all my graphic design files for the last years 
len ratingfive Reliable easy access and TONS of storage 
len ratingfive  I completely forgot I had my files in drive 
len ratingfive I have been able to save and share all my files dated years back 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive  After all it s a google product 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive  Integrates seamlessly with my photo apps 
len ratingfive  Simply put I use it every day and it makes keeping my life and work organized and in sync a pleasure

len ratingfive  My go to app for all my files 
len ratingfive I literally could not work without it 
len ratingfive Quick easy robust improvements rolled out all the time what more could you ask from an app 
len ratingfive  star all the way 
len ratingfive I cannot update to the latest update 
len ratingone Cannot update to the latest version even though it keeps appearing as an update 
len ratingone When I select it get an error stating cannot update as iOS is required 
len ratingone Who dropped the ball on this one 
len ratingthree  I have to really know what I can do to eliminate other record saving apps
len ratingfive  Forget about the iCloud where you can t view what s on there and have to paying constant upgrade storage fees 
len ratingfive This is free and allows a preview 
len ratingfive Awesome app
len ratingone  How annoying to receive updates for Drive when my devices are not able to be updated to ios 
len ratingone This current and future updates should not be sent to those who cannot install them 
len ratingone I give star for the effort in updating Google Drive 
len ratingone  Since upgrade this app is no longer compatible with iPad s which can t be upgrade to ios 
len ratingfive  This app is necessary for the student business person or anyone to be able to access documents from anywhere with internet 
len ratingfive Muy buena aplicaci n para guardar tus fotos y videos realmente bueno 
len ratingfive I r m
len ratingone  THIS APP SUCKS if you don t listen and you were actually lose all of your customers from making this mistake of not letting people from all falls download this app if I was you I would teach it as fast as I can

len ratingfive An educator s must have 
len ratingfive  Best place to store data
len ratingthree  I love google drive but today I m being punished because I don t have the latest iPad or current IOS 
len ratingthree This product should continue to support all versions especially for those of us that don t have the ability to afford to upgrade 
len ratingthree I m very disappointed in Google and this update 
len ratingfive  I love Google drive because I can keep all my files in app be place 
len ratingfive And if I need to edit a file I can do it in google docs 
len ratingfive Works for any and everything I need to do
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingtwo  I have iOS 
len ratingtwo The update keeps telling me that I need and then offers to install the latest compatible version which it does 
len ratingtwo After a few minutes it starts all over again 
len ratingfive  Necessary and Awesome App 
len ratingfive Makes document management super simple 
len ratingfive The drive app is great and makes it extremely convenient to access all of my documents on the fly 
len ratingfive  It is good to have access from anywhere
len ratingone  IOS devices like my Gen iPad cannot upgrade to iOS

len ratingfive  With a laptop and several iOS devices I have been able to back up important files music and photos to my Google Drive and view them on all of my devices very cool 
len ratingfive I move around a lot so having everything in one place is nice 
len ratingfive  Awesome app
len ratingfive Perfect to me no complaints at all extended data that saves on the go easy and essential
len ratingfive Great selection of apps 
len ratingfive The UI could be improved to look more like Evernote in my opinion but other than that it works great 
len ratingone  Although I have iOS I also am using an iPhone 
len ratingone In that the Sept update is evidently not compatible with an iPhone why would the update continue to appear within the Apps Store as an update for iPhone users with iOS 
len ratingone Why am I even receiving a non compatible update 
len ratingfour  New update says requires IOS or above and I have 
len ratingfour Imagine that another piece of crap apple product 
len ratingfour  Everytime update i never finished on ios why 
len ratingfive It makes my life so much easier and I m always recommending it to clients 
len ratingfive It s key for me because it s free and I m always on the go desktop iPad phone from city to city And at home or at work 
len ratingfive I never have to worry about my files wether personal or work related 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfour  I Love the drive app 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive  I love and breath because of this app 
len ratingfive Able to access all my files and documents on my phone anywhere anytime
len ratingfive Google Drive is one of my go to apps 
len ratingfive I use it to store file and to exchange them with associates 
len ratingfive The cost of storage is reasonable and associate can easily access files that I share 
len ratingfive I only wish that Updates would continue to be compatible with my iPad 
len ratingfive  Very smooth user experience
len ratingfour  I can access all of my documents via mobile phone iPad or PC 
len ratingfour I can organize print and download with ease 
len ratingfour I wish the backups I sync to my computer would save ALL of the documents I want to backup 
len ratingfour For some reason misc docs are skipped 
len ratingfour If not for this it d be stars 
len ratingone The most recent update ruined this program 
len ratingone I can no longer use it on my older iPad 
len ratingfive  Is good
len ratingfive  Useful
len ratingfive  Very useful app
len ratingtwo  Sadly and a bit shockingly Google s latest version of Drive without warning stopped supporting first and second generation iPads 
len ratingtwo Older versions of the app if previously installed still work but demand to be updated the update flag is on 
len ratingtwo But the update fails with a not compatible error message and the update flag won t go away 
len ratingfour Since this update the app is not recognizing my iOS is currently and is making me download an older compatible version of Drive 
len ratingfour Is anyone else having this problem 
len ratingfour Update engineers are aware of the issue and are working on it per chat support 
len ratingfive Excellent tool for personal or business use
len ratingfive  Tis the best 
len ratingfive  timo App para salvar seus arquivos na nuvem
len ratingfive  Google drive makes working with multiple devices an enjoyable experience 
len ratingfive I use a mac a windows computer an iPhone and sometimes a Chromebook 
len ratingfive I design on one device Mac iPhone or Chromebook then move to a CNC machine windows computer 
len ratingfive The Workflow is painless 
len ratingfive Save the file and it s available where there is an internet connection 
len ratingfive Great work Google 
len ratingone Latest update is incompatible with IPad 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone I m not upgrading my IPad anytime soon 
len ratingfive  What a great app 
len ratingone Like Google Photos recently this app uses a ton of cellular data in the background on my iPhone 
len ratingone Had to stop using it 
len ratingfour  My iPhone is running iOS and yet the app just won t update 
len ratingfour Even after I deleted it and reinstalled it 
len ratingfour The app refuses to update 
len ratingfour The situation has not changed 
len ratingfour Please fix thank you 
len ratingfive  I use this app to store all of my photos and videos and I love it 
len ratingfive So simple to use 
len ratingfive Very convenient and useful
len ratingfive  This is one of my key resource tools in my biz tool box 
len ratingfour Update indicates my iPad is no longer a supported device 
len ratingfour I ve encountered this on multiple apps updating due to iOS release and apps developers were able to resolve the issue on their next update cycle 
len ratingfour Please correct thanks 
len ratingone  iTunes notified of an update 
len ratingone I tried to update the app said I had to download an earlier version because I needed iOS 
len ratingone I have iOS 
len ratingone I downloaded it anyway then iTunes notified an update available 
len ratingone Reported the problem to google they said report it to Apple 
len ratingone I did and Apple said report it to Google 
len ratingone I deleted the app problem solved 
len ratingone I would never recommend this app 
len ratingone Tech support is non existent 
len ratingone  I have an iPad rd gen with an iOS and I am not able to update Google Drive despite the statement that is compatible with iOS and above 
len ratingthree  It s taking forever to backup my photos
len ratingfive Everything is synced available anywhere secure from coffee spills on laptops 
len ratingfive Totally worth the month for gb
len ratingfour I am using the Drive app on my s iPhone which cannot upgrade to the iOS to get the latest version 
len ratingfour The app keep downloading again and again but never finish the installing 
len ratingfour Something is wrong 
len ratingfour Please fix it 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone  Tells me that Google Drive is no longer compatible with this iPad 
len ratingone So dumb 
len ratingfour Convenient in handy
len ratingfive  I like this app
len ratingfour  I keep all of my crucial work on drive to make sure I have it when I need it 
len ratingfour Unfortunately the app seems to like crashing constantly since a month or so ago 
len ratingone Won t update on my iPhone 
len ratingone Got so frustrated so did a delete and reinstall 
len ratingone Now cannot even get the app installed on my phone 
len ratingone Help 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingone  I have iOS said google drive had update 
len ratingone I have iPhone will not update unless iPhone C or newer I deleted drive and now Can NOT download drive 
len ratingone Will not give option to download older version 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive This have been a real asset to my being able to access music for our church and to also have documents on the road 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Very helpful it make my life easy 
len ratingfive Highly recommended to everyone 
len ratingfive This is literally how I ve been going through college these past few years 
len ratingfive This works perfectly with Docs as fellow classmates we always say put in Docs and which I easily can see not just Docs but all other saved material on the Drive 
len ratingfive I can print effortlessly from the drive app and I can save reports and receipts and all other stuff 
len ratingfive I have yet to see any reasons why I should give this app less than stars 
len ratingfive  and always just a tap away
len ratingfive Works well in conjunction with my PC 
len ratingfive Backups happen quickly and frequently and managing your files is a breeze 
len ratingfive  I love that I can access from anywhere 
len ratingone This version will not work on an iPad 
len ratingone  for the love of gd stop telling me there is an update if you can t update it
len ratingfive  I utilize it daily in my personal life and it has really helped my small business 
len ratingfive It s an amazing way to collaborate with others and access info from many devices and locations 
len ratingone Apple has lost it s vision 
len ratingone Google drive is no longer compatible with iPad or my iPhone 
len ratingone This is the nd app that will NOT UPDATE on my iPhone iPad because Apple obviously won t give older Apple hardware devices an updated iOS 
len ratingone Instead of recognizing there are some of us still out there loyal to the Apple brand we are being forced to decide to buy new Apple hardware or another non iOS brand 
len ratingone New iPhone 
len ratingone I think not unless it can clean my house and run errands for me 
len ratingone It s all about corporate greed for the all mighty my friends 
len ratingone Don t waste your time or money on Apple products anymore 
len ratingone Amazon just released a host of affordable gadgets and devices 
len ratingone A GB inch Kindle Fire starts at and with a micro SD card you have enough storage options to buy several tablets before you reach the price of decent iPad 
len ratingone I ve never used android or any other smartphone or tablet other than Apple 
len ratingone I do use a PC 
len ratingone I ve been saving my for a new K TV with all the cool features the iPad and the new iPhone or X costs as much or more than some of the latest TV s on the market right now sans OLED technology 
len ratingone What has Apple done lately 
len ratingone The recent keynote proved to me there is no reason nothing truly innovative to compel me to upgrade my iPhone or iPad for that matter 
len ratingone Now that I m losing apps on my iPhone and iPad I d like to thank Apple for helping me decide 
len ratingone That s right THANK YOU APPLE FOR YOUR DISLOYALTY 
len ratingone I m going to buy a Kindle Fire or a Samsung Tablet to replace my IPad 
len ratingone And I will buy a Samsung Galaxy or Note with superior displays storage and cameras for far less and superior technology 
len ratingone After all it s probably made on the same assembly line as many Apple components and I won t have the expectation that it will last or be supported for years 
len ratingone Hasta la vista baby 
len ratingone RIP Steve 
len ratingone  Keep trying to update but get a message that I can only update an older version because it needs 
len ratingone I m on 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive Does what it says
len ratingthree Updated Still love it BUT After several attempts to sync two videos I gave up 
len ratingthree Left my laptop running for eight hours one day and it would only get to then start over again 
len ratingthree Frustrated I completely deleted the videos from both my phone and laptop yet it still continues to attempt to sync the nonexistent videos 
len ratingthree I love this app and use it often 
len ratingthree I do wish I could sort my folders by name and have them stay that way when the contents of the folders were sorted by date uploaded 
len ratingthree That would make this app perfect 
len ratingone  its not even updating on my phone even though theres no problem with the wifi
len ratingfive How did I manage anything before Google 
len ratingfive You ve simplified my life and my teaching 
len ratingfive Love my Google apps every single one of them 
len ratingone  I keep getting an error that says I need iOS 
len ratingone Which I have but the app for some reason isn t seeing that
len ratingone  I found the UI difficult to figure out 
len ratingone I do not use Google Driver very often and I have to re learn every time I need it for something 
len ratingone It is no longer compatible with my iPad even though I have a listed iOS 
len ratingtwo  Can t even use the Files app now since Drive insists on opening every file I tap 
len ratingone Why does it continue to say it needs iOS when that is what I have 
len ratingone It wants to download an older version
len ratingthree Most recent update won t load successfully on my iPad with Retina Display 
len ratingthree It tells me that I need to have iOS present to work my iPad is iOS 
len ratingthree This is the update bug recently plagued the Marriott app except that they fixed their s 
len ratingfive  Just amazing
len ratingfour Great app overall 
len ratingfour I love that I can IL use it to print from my phone and access my files anywhere 
len ratingfour I would ve given it stars but I don t like the way drive and all google products handles files 
len ratingfour Instead of making it easier to find things the document view makes it harder 
len ratingfour I want better file sorting filters too 
len ratingone  If you won t support my phone then don t let it show as an update in the app store 
len ratingone Not that hard 
len ratingone It is a check box in the development kit
len ratingone  Very irritated to receive this message when I try to update 
len ratingfive  Nice way to share pix mob PDF etc 
len ratingfive among pic phone tablet
len ratingone  The latest update works fine on newer devices 
len ratingone However it also appeared on my iOS devices 
len ratingone It won t download and won t clear 
len ratingone This pending update is now stuck in my App Store 
len ratingone I may have to move my data to Dropbox and delete the app from all devices 
len ratingfive  Awesome app
len ratingfive  I think Google Drive is outstanding and given the price it suits my budget admirably 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone  Latest update won t work on rd gen iPad so now I have to delete the app or have a constant reminder to update app because it can t update 
len ratingone Thanks Google
len ratingone  Not everyone can afford to upgrade every time a new iPhone comes out 
len ratingone My iPhone C runs iOS it should still be supported 
len ratingone The current version on this device is but Google Drive want to download an older version 
len ratingone WHY
len ratingfive I looooveeeee this app 
len ratingone  Very frustrating google drive hijacks all file types on iOS which means any file you try to open from the new files app now flings you to google drive 
len ratingone This seems like an underhanded way to get me to use this app more 
len ratingfive  Very useful
len ratingfive  I use it literally everyday 
len ratingfive Despite the slow response it s a really good app to use 
len ratingone  Bring back support for iPod touch th generation 
len ratingone  The app places copies of my work into the trash bin and doesn t always sink the first time 
len ratingone I find myself sinking my doc several times before it does what it was suppose to 
len ratingfive Makes my life so much easier 
len ratingfive Super easy to work with and you can access your data from anytime from anywhere 
len ratingfive If you like staying organized this makes it a breeze 
len ratingfive Check it out and you ll see for yourself 
len ratingfive It is so seamlessly adapted in Apple s Files app 
len ratingfive Very usable 
len ratingfive Btw how to switch accounts within the Files app 
len ratingone  The latest versions being updated are now INCOMPATIBLE with older versions of iPads like the iPad 
len ratingone World Class engineering development would handle logic for differences in iOS versions in order to retain compatibility 
len ratingone It s called If then else programming logic 
len ratingone This is a much better practice instead 
len ratingtwo  What were you thinking and not to update this for days so far 
len ratingtwo I think you ve left a pretty big population in the lurch 
len ratingone Disappointed because I loved Google Drive but no longer able to access my documents on my iPad 
len ratingone Could you make an upgrade even if we need to pay for it 
len ratingtwo  Current update keeps trying to go back to a previous version for non users but I have a still compatible version 
len ratingtwo If I download it it comes up again 
len ratingtwo Fix this glitch please 
len ratingtwo No problems until now on my end with this app 
len ratingone who in the world decided to make it no longer compatible with iPod Touch 
len ratingfive  It s very easy to save edit and send docs utilizing this app 
len ratingfive I can quickly recall files from my phone and email or text them to anyone 
len ratingfive Perfect storage system 
len ratingfive  One of the most useful Applications ever 
len ratingfour  Recent update does not install says it is not compatible with my iPad 
len ratingfour I have an iPad and have been using this app for years 
len ratingfour The app requirements says minimum is IOS is this a release mistake 
len ratingfour I hope google does not drop support for IOS that would make all iPad users very disappointed 
len ratingone  Please make it so iPhone consumers can receive the updates even without downloading and installing iOS 
len ratingone We only need iOS to run the app 
len ratingone Why take off iPhone then 
len ratingone There are still plenty of google drive users who have not yet purchased a new iPhone 
len ratingone This is an easy fix not many other apps have dropped iPhone compatibility 
len ratingfive  I have nothing to say but great things 
len ratingfive The best 
len ratingfive Google Drive is the best service I have gotten since large file services started 
len ratingfive It is also integrated in to all google stuff 
len ratingfive Service rates are low too 
len ratingfive If your Amy type of production and need to store or send files I recommend Google drive 
len ratingfour  Pretty easy to use 
len ratingfour The only feature i d love to see is a goto page when viewing a pdf etc 
len ratingone The new version in not compatible with iPhone s iOS v 
len ratingtwo I am not a heavy google user 
len ratingtwo I have a google drive account because other people like to use it to share stuff 
len ratingtwo I recently added this app to my iPad 
len ratingtwo I have a spreadsheet that contains some contact data I like to reference 
len ratingtwo I store this in iCloud drive which allows me to preview it 
len ratingtwo Ever since installing google drive before I deleted it that has changed 
len ratingtwo I click on the spread sheet in the files app 
len ratingtwo I get a quick preview and then the google drive app launched and asked if I wanted to save this document to google drive 
len ratingtwo I have this document stored in iCloud drive and and happy with my system 
len ratingtwo I don t like how invasive this app is 
len ratingtwo I will stick to the web interface 
len ratingfive  I use Drive almost daily for all of the above works great and makes finding documents much easier with the folders 
len ratingone  Latest update is not compatible with this iPad Please fix this 
len ratingone FYI Marriott did the same thing but fixed it in one week 
len ratingone If you need technical assistance ask them 
len ratingfive  Can t live without it 
len ratingone  Why do you say that it is available for iOS and up yet any older iPad no longer updatable 
len ratingtwo  Latest version won t download citing a requirement of IOS but that s the current installed version 
len ratingtwo App doc says IOS should work 
len ratingfive  Very good

len ratingthree I also can t download the latest version requires which I have 
len ratingfive  Enjoy to use it a lot very easy and convenient user friendly
len ratingfive  This is my goto storage 
len ratingfive it s simple to use share and maintain 
len ratingfive i get any information i need wherever i am located 
len ratingthree On my older iPad in the iOS App Store I get prompted to update Google Drive Vers 
len ratingthree But then it says cannot be updated 
len ratingfive  app 
len ratingone  Come on Google play fair 
len ratingone Are you clueless as to how many users are still on the c 
len ratingone Do you think not making the latest version of Drive compatible with c is going to cause anyone to suddenly drop their c for an Android 
len ratingone If so you are badly mistaken 
len ratingone Now get with the program and make Drive c compatible again 
len ratingtwo  Should not offer an update and then say the update cannot be performed on iPhone using 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingtwo  Wha the Frak 
len ratingfive  The best drive
len ratingfive  Google drive is the cheapest most reliable cloud storage app made 
len ratingfive Hands down in quality and price they beat out the other free pay as you go providers 
len ratingfive They don t big brother you like other cloud drives do 
len ratingfive There ability to code the site with open source guidelines is reassuring and I hope this continues Through the years of storing data on Google Drive I haven t noticed a loss of files 
len ratingfive If your looking for the best storage for the price choose Google drive 
len ratingfive It is the BEST 
len ratingfive  Google drive offers a great avenue to retrieve your documents across multiple devices OS platforms 
len ratingfive  Works great any where
len ratingfive  As it should be 
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingone  I am only rating this app with star based on my old iPhone s is incompatible with the new version 
len ratingtwo  The title says it all 
len ratingfive  Easy to use 
len ratingfive A free supplement to Dropbox 
len ratingfive  I d download it now 
len ratingone  There is no reason this should not be eligible for an update on anything but the latest released tech 
len ratingone Getting the not available on this IPad yet the update option is flagged 
len ratingone It is a simple storage app trying to restrict it so people buy a new device is ridiculous 
len ratingone  It shows up on the list to update then says my iPad isn t comparable and that it needs which I have 
len ratingone My iPad is just fine and there is no reason to get a new one 
len ratingone Programs like this can be made to work if they want to 
len ratingfive  Google Drive has always been a loved service and app by me and family 
len ratingfive Now with a superb Files integration it became even better 
len ratingfive Thank you Alphabet 
len ratingfive When you can access all documents via your phone or computer even other people s phone and computers this is the one 
len ratingfive It is not only accessible but any kind of documents you could just view in your Drive and save it there 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone  More lazy programming 
len ratingone Now the latest updated application is no longer compatible with the older iPads IOS 
len ratingone I now have to resort back to my Windows computer to use google drive 
len ratingone Go stinking figure 
len ratingthree  Why is the app available to update if I can t update it 
len ratingthree Says it s not compatible 
len ratingthree Please fix because I can t get rid of the badge now 
len ratingthree iPhone S iOS 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is great and I am so happy that it even is allowed to exist in Apple s crappy walled garden 
len ratingfive Apple blocks even basic Google Cloud printing throughout most of iOS without an paid app FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN GREED and they block all kinds of media I should be free to do like BUY something from ANYONE I CHOOSE using their app instead of having to jump through their insulting hoops and go to a web browser FOR NO OTHER REASON BUT GREED AND they block me choosing pics from Google Photos which is where I backup all my pictures across platforms 
len ratingfive I am AMAZED they let Google get away with cloud printing from Drive but it works 
len ratingfive  Google drive is wonderful 
len ratingfive I keep photos and files PowerPoint and drawings 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfour I had this app and loved it until the September update 
len ratingfour The app and whole service overall are great so my only problem is that my device isn t compatible with the mobile version 
len ratingfour Google DON T REQUIRE PEOPLE TO HAVE ONLY THE NEWEST IOS SOFTWARE UPDATE 
len ratingfour  Unable to download the update on my iPhone plus device 
len ratingfour Please fix asap 
len ratingone Doesn t work now with iPod touch 
len ratingone Will there be a fix 
len ratingfive  Works well every time
len ratingone  Too bad 
len ratingone Bye bye Google Drive 
len ratingfive  I love it I keep lots of information in there and it s always with me 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  Amazing
len ratingfour  Great app but there s no option to find words in PDF s 
len ratingone So with iOS in order for me to use the Files folder have to remove my passcode WTF
len ratingfive Effortless a Fast Professional What else could you ask for 
len ratingone  Huge security problem 
len ratingone When I attempt to open a file from my iPad or iPhone it immediately diverts to my Google Drive and asks to save to my gmail account 
len ratingone Worked normally after deleting my Google Drive app 
len ratingone Big problem 
len ratingone Just checked update still not fixed 
len ratingfive  Thank you
len ratingtwo  Still a useful app in spite of apparent drop of Apple App Store update support for iPod touch th generation on final iOS release as of 
len ratingtwo Sigh 
len ratingtwo All thanks to iOS s introduction 
len ratingtwo Boo 
len ratingfour  I have updated the application in the iPhone and the surprise is that the application is no longer in Arabic as it was before
len ratingone Latest update drops support for S but it still shows up in App Store Updates on my S 
len ratingone If I can t update it why is it there 
len ratingone Fix this so it either works on the S or gets off the Update list and I can go back to using the Update All button again 
len ratingone  Update complains that this version requires iOS but that s what I m running G 
len ratingone Settings General Update says it s the latest version that the system software is up to date 
len ratingone  Update The app has not been fixed with the latest update and there is nowhere at Google to report bugs 
len ratingone An awful product 
len ratingone Original review Had to delete this app due to its bad behavior 
len ratingone Nasty bug 
len ratingone When I tried to update Google Drive on my iPad running iOS I got a popup msg that said or later was required 
len ratingone I deleted the app from my iPad and reinstalled same result What s going on 
len ratingone  Latest version is not for IOS or less
len ratingone  Need to fix it 
len ratingone Just oscillates between old and new revisions 
len ratingfive  Will be glad when it is a little more compatible with Word and other MS products but for my business it s a life saver 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingtwo  Google Did you not have a designer properly inspect the measurements and guidelines on the App Store before preparing the App Icon 
len ratingtwo The Drive logo mark is WAY TOO BIG people can see is and use it without making it look to large 
len ratingtwo This app icon looks like garbage FIX IT 
len ratingone  THIS IS TAKING FOREVER TO LOAD 
len ratingtwo  Attempt to update first says purchase not authorized later says this update requires iOS or later but offers to update to last supported version 
len ratingtwo The current version says requires or later 
len ratingtwo What gives 
len ratingfive Will continue to keep shared files here for clients
len ratingfive  I love this app to save files on the go and access them everywhere
len ratingfive  Thanks Google for making life simple 
len ratingfive Easy to use integrates with iOS chrome 
len ratingfive  Let s me do everything I need with seamless transition between phone web and desktop interface 
len ratingfive Linked between the other google productivity sweet makes the whole experience perfect for getting things done with little to no fuss 
len ratingfive I get my work done at home on my iPhone it s so easy to use 
len ratingone  Seriously 
len ratingone Though i made available offline something I can t open it in another app without internet 
len ratingone It says File could not be downloaded 
len ratingone I can open it in drive app without internet but default drive app is not good for opening every file 
len ratingone So each time to open a file in another app it requires internet connection which is disgusting 
len ratingone Please Change this 
len ratingone I am eagerly waiting 
len ratingone  Whenever I try to open a file in the new Files app it redirects to Google Drive 
len ratingone After deleting Google Drive Files performs as expected 
len ratingfive  Good job Google this takes an already infinitely useful app and makes it better 
len ratingfive When I first used files with Google Drive I was afraid I was doing something wrong as it did not fit the whole interface 
len ratingfive Now it works perfectly and I can move files around with no issue 
len ratingfive Thanks for the quick turnaround 
len ratingfive  I use Google Drive to let my siblings know the status of one of our trusts 
len ratingfive Using Google Drive means they can check the status when they want to rather than waiting for me to send them a copy 
len ratingone  The latest Google Drive update connecting Google Drive to the new Files app has rendered the Google Drive app unable to be updated on devices with iOS 
len ratingone Very disappointing 
len ratingone  Don t let update the app from AppStore a warning say that require iOS and I have iOS so 
len ratingfive I really like this service 
len ratingone  New version still doesn t fix the widespread issue where all DOCX files in iCloud Drive are forced to open in this app 
len ratingone Only fix is to uninstall Google Drive 
len ratingone  The new version in not compatible with iPhone s 
len ratingfive Very helpful for me 
len ratingfive  Love this app products and reliability 
len ratingfive  Drive on my phone is amazing I can access unless all my files and play videos total win 
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingone  How Google can do this 
len ratingone After the recent update for Google Drive on iOS made useless Files App that access all other Cloud services 
len ratingone Ruined my business presentation 
len ratingone This is a serious intrusion on our configuration data on iPhones and iPads 
len ratingone I had to delete Google Drive even I pay for storage 
len ratingone From usual amazing Google to usual indifferent to customers Google 
len ratingone Get a good deal on iCloud 
len ratingfive  Love the versatility and large capacity of a google drive 
len ratingfive I can access almost any where and any time 
len ratingfive  I use Drive for personal and business self employed record keeping 
len ratingfive It s reliable and user friendly 
len ratingfive I highly recommend 
len ratingfive  Indispensable 
len ratingfive Very quick and easy to upload and share 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive This app has saved my tookas countless times 
len ratingfive Especially with backups and sharing 
len ratingfive I m also grateful it is free 
len ratingfive Has become my essential online storage solution 
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive for many years 
len ratingfive Could nt live without it 
len ratingfive  Very helpful for accessing all types of files
len ratingfive  app that i can not live without it
len ratingone  switched to mega for file storage because it actually works
len ratingthree  Rarely lets me upload anything from my phone anymore 
len ratingfive  Love this app I love this app because it saves me space on my phone and I don t have to delete my precious photos 
len ratingfive  With others
len ratingfive The mobile application is great for working on the go 
len ratingfive I am able to integrate various tasks into one clean and accessible location 
len ratingfive I can create documents for my project team and they can collaborate simultaneously to reduce overall project timelines 
len ratingfive This app takes the stress out of delivering projects on time and on budget 
len ratingfive  Amazing app 
len ratingfive Loving it each day
len ratingfive  A long time ago Larry Ellison proposed that if files were kept on the internet what we now call The Cloud we wouldn t need personal computers any more just a terminal 
len ratingfive He was ahead of his time and he doesn t deserve any greater riches anyway 
len ratingfive But Google Drive kind of accomplishes his vision all your files accessible any time from any device with an internet connection 
len ratingfive And it s like a month 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive  This is a great tool and it s free 
len ratingfive Plenty of storage for work in progress and sharing photos and documents 
len ratingfive No complaints
len ratingfive Most apps work better on an apple device 
len ratingfive This is one of them 
len ratingfive Quick clean and easy to navigate 
len ratingfive  Best for All sorts of sorting and organizing specially for a college student 
len ratingfive My daughter is obligated by her teachers not only to set up Google Classroom for individual classes with total parent participation via their district supervised assigned Google Gmail accounts now in middle school she has accountability to get instructors for when how what she did for homework before the class starts that morning 
len ratingfive Work parents and the particular teachers can see in real time that yes she did this or that work 
len ratingfive Public education online not online education just streamlined with Google Drive 
len ratingfive No paper need be turned in like last year 
len ratingfive  Thank goodness It is amazing what is being done now parents heard rumors since kindergarten and we all ran out and bought our rd and th graders Chrome Books But the most awesome thing is that I as a parent am invited from day one this year to keep up with her assignments via school loop and signing up with all the referrals for Pearson success net Google Classroom various other online study guides and practice test workshops with my child s classroom teacher provided log in 
len ratingfive Last year I had to comb through her entire backpack daily to find all the paperwork she forgot to give me to sign requests for supplies due by a certain date her Report Card I was supposed to sign that I hadn t received it the parent teacher conference appointment I never got 
len ratingfive What kids are learning now is what I had to go to college for and I m a grateful single parent for every Google Classroom Drive Docs Sheets Gmail accounts made for these purposes 
len ratingfive This is the year it all is finally coming together 
len ratingfive th grade streamlined online homework assignments with teacher provided log in for each student and parent to log into study practice tests homework assignments submitted without paper 
len ratingfive homework is assigned done and submitted all within Google drive 
len ratingfive Thank you God 
len ratingfive Last year was a nightmare instructors attached assignments in Word format as a word document that my daughter could not convert on her Chrome Book 
len ratingfive So if I didn t already have a PC with an active MS Office with Word she couldn t convert it to a Google Doc to work on it at all and If I couldn t print an assignment my daughter had to email it to her counselor at school and show up minutes early in the office to request the emailed printout of her homework assignment for her home room class 
len ratingfive It been assumed that each home not only has a personal computer and a functioning printer with ink and paper but of course WI Fi not so 
len ratingfive I m on permanent disability with once a month social security income 
len ratingfive I rent a room we share a bunkbed for my daughter and I to live in another families home that is considered homeless under the McKinney Vinto education act by the way and yet Google makes small miracles happen when it all comes together for the greater good of our children s higher learning 
len ratingfive I am blessed to have an amazing year old that WANTS to be her best and says she loves Science Math even though it s really tough she loves the challenge AND is auditioning for lead singer in her th grade Choir 
len ratingfive Dreams do come true since kindergarten at age she said I want to be a Rock Star AND a Scientist when I grow up 
len ratingfive It s happening 
len ratingfive I thank you Google everything 
len ratingfive My daughter is years old and learning what college kids barely got exposed to if they took the College Prep classes like I did 
len ratingfive  amazingly wonderful blessings for today s children 
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingfive  This app is the future
len ratingone  Keeps blacking out and crashing PLZ FIX 
len ratingone I would rate it a but i keep having the same problem over and over again 
len ratingfive  I ve stuck with drive ever since 
len ratingfive It s straight forward and has never let me down 
len ratingfive Definitely a productivity tool that would be hard to live without 
len ratingfive  Good storage and organization of files and folders 
len ratingone  Whose hair brained idea was it to have this app automatically compress RAW image files like tif when downloading 
len ratingone Not only is there NO OPTION to turn this feature off the compression is incredibly bad leaving shadows looking like wet murky pools and lending a round dull impression to images in general 
len ratingone Avoid this app until this dev team gives the option to turn this off if they ever do 
len ratingone Why can t developers learn not to try to fix things that are not broken 
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingfive  As good as it gets plus all files on cloud and no worry about limited space on your devices 
len ratingfive  Very good app for me I love
len ratingfive  One of the essential tools of everyday use 
len ratingfive  Could not think of my day to day tasks without it 
len ratingfive Period 
len ratingfive  Works well regardless of if I am using a Mac Chromebook or an iOS device 
len ratingfive Nice to have something reliable that JUST WORKS 
len ratingfive It s the bee s knees 
len ratingfive Nice to have something that works on all platforms 
len ratingfive  Reliable good to store and edit photos documents pdfs sound files and sync on all of your devices 
len ratingfive This app has been a godsend for me someone who lives and works on the road and likes to travel light 
len ratingfive  One of the best ways to transfer files
len ratingfive  Can t leave it especially during traveling availability while offline is very useful
len ratingfive I love to have access to all my documents anywhere anytime 
len ratingfive Thank you for keeping it free
len ratingfive  Helps me keep my papers organized 
len ratingfour  Needs iMessage app like OneDrive to share files 
len ratingfour Apple TV app Apple Watch app would be nice too if possible 
len ratingone  I can upload a picture and video from an iphone shared folder to Google Drive 
len ratingone I can Save Image the picture from Google Drive to my iphone camera roll 
len ratingone WORKS 
len ratingone HOWEVER I CAN NOT Save the video from Google Drive to my iphone camera roll 
len ratingone It goes through the motions including the Save Video button but the video never shows up 
len ratingone FAIL 
len ratingone This worked 
len ratingone I have gone completely mobile so I cant use a PC to see if Google Drive has a useable video 
len ratingone But Using both the Google iphone web browser and Iphone Safari web browser and logged into Google Drive I can t play any of the videos uploaded to Google Drive but I can see the uploaded photos 
len ratingone Bad Video Upload to google drive 
len ratingfive  One of the best values on the internet 
len ratingfive Great storage and flexibility
len ratingfive  Google drive makes life easier 
len ratingfive I work smarter not harder 
len ratingfive  Makes life in education so much more efficient 
len ratingfive  Google drive is essential to work and leisure document and photo cloud storage 
len ratingfive  G Drive has become one of the most essential components of my virtual office both for business and personally 
len ratingfive It is cross platform stable and packed with functionality 
len ratingfive Well done G team 
len ratingfive Enough said 
len ratingfive This is such a nifty app 
len ratingfive  Very useful no crashes
len ratingfive This app has made working from my phone actually possible 
len ratingfive This actually gives me most of the power of my computer on my phone 
len ratingfive Hard to edit docs in the phone but I anticipate improvement there soon
len ratingfive  Great app that works well and does what it advertises that it can do 
len ratingfive  Drive is essential to my use of multiple apps for the most effective means of access processing and storage of my photography 
len ratingfive I love using Google drive because it enables me to have access to files wherever I am and share them with whoever I want 
len ratingfive  Excellent when always on the run and needing to update documents 
len ratingfive Really helps when in a pinch or you can t remember things 
len ratingfive It is always with you 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingone  Hurry up with native iOS files integration like Dropbox also HEIF uploads don t work 
len ratingfive  This is the best way to stay organized 
len ratingfive Combined with CamScanner I no longer have paper clutter 
len ratingfive CamScanner creates clear PDF files from photos and I can easily upload them to Google Drive 
len ratingfive Honestly my whole life is on Google Drive 
len ratingfive I don t buy thumb drives or anything 
len ratingfive Everything I need is always at the tip of my fingers AND IT S FREE 
len ratingfive I also love that I can easily convert a Google Doc to a word file or PDF 
len ratingfive The same applies for Sheets and Slides 
len ratingfive This app is just awesome 
len ratingfive Gosto muito dele arquivo muita coisa e acesso aonde eu quiser 
len ratingfive  It s GREAT 
len ratingfive  Awesome app
len ratingfive  This is an essential application for sharing documents and other pieces of work amongst other people and storing work on multiple devices I strongly recommend it 
len ratingfour  I was going to share a folder with my friends and i typed in the first letter and it said no results 
len ratingfour I got frustrated and just stoped trying because it wouldn t work 
len ratingfour So can you please fix this 
len ratingfour Otherwise the app is great though 
len ratingfive  We use it all the time in my program especially for study guides 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Haven t found any problems
len ratingfive I like it alot I use it alot 
len ratingfive I download it on ever device I own
len ratingfour  Nice
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive It s free and easy to use 
len ratingfour  Good job working together apple and google
len ratingfive Google drive helps me to keep in touch with my work documents
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Easy 
len ratingfive Love 
len ratingfive  Will be even better if iOS files support comes 
len ratingfive This app makes life so much easier by having all your essential and not so essential documents pictures etc 
len ratingfive available anytime and anyplace 
len ratingfive Don t know how I lived without it 
len ratingfive Get better and faster with each update 
len ratingthree  This is a great app and I would give it a star rating if it allowed the following feature editing 
len ratingthree You can t edit any of your files on this app 
len ratingthree In order to edit you have to download the app of the file you want to download i e 
len ratingthree Google Docs to edit a doc Google slides to edit a presentation etc 
len ratingthree This takes up a lot of my storage 
len ratingthree Other than this lack of feature the app has good storage reliability and a place where you can access all your files 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive  I use google drive for everything 
len ratingfive  I can t rave enough about the reliability power and freedom found in Google Docs 
len ratingfive Free software 
len ratingfive Who else gives you more than this 
len ratingfive  I love google drive 
len ratingfive It s so convenient to be able to access files on all my devices 
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingfive  So easy to use 
len ratingfive Makes it easy to decide which way you want to share your files pictures or videos 
len ratingfive  Great for school 
len ratingfive Very organized and easy to use 
len ratingfive Jaw dropping
len ratingone Keeps trying to open all my documents can no longer open documents in any other app
len ratingfive We do a lot of client projects and vocal recording as well as promotional video work 
len ratingfive Typically to deliver a files you d use a Dropbox site 
len ratingfive Ugh 
len ratingfive The client would be forced to create an account and log in 
len ratingfive You couldn t trust what the app was asking the client to do 
len ratingfive Gdrive get the sharing link or enter the email directly done 
len ratingfive Another vastly superior Google Product
len ratingfive  This a business saver 
len ratingfive Easy to use simple to see
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfour  Accessible and dependable easy to work with 
len ratingfour The iPhone app allows my team to be connected so much better 
len ratingfour I have given it five stars but they do make it difficult to work with Microsoft office products 
len ratingfive Hasn t let me down 
len ratingfive I ve used Google drive for as long as it s been around and it s predecessor Google docs 
len ratingfive It s been refined and updated often and gets better every time 
len ratingfive It s had challenges in the past with opening certain documents with a lot of formatting but it s largely moved past this and has a lot to offer 
len ratingone  Can t have this and iCloud on the same device 
len ratingone Any MS Office document you attempt to open in iCloud requires it to be saved in Drive first before it can be opened 
len ratingone I deleted this app until they fix this issue 
len ratingfive How
len ratingfive I don t need anything else 
len ratingfive  Being able to access from ay device and anywhere is a pulse 
len ratingfive I tend to move from Room to room and I am still able to get work done 
len ratingfive I appreciate no having to be tied down to one device and my students are able to participate and learn new skills 
len ratingfour  The drive window pops up but immediately goes away Can t upload to drive from photos and other apps 
len ratingfive Muy buena soluci n
len ratingfive Love Drive 
len ratingfive Makes managing life and business so much easier 
len ratingthree  Very good app but I ll be glad when it updates with native support for the Files app 
len ratingthree In its current form Drive appears as a document provider in Files but doesn t use the native UI like Dropbox now does 
len ratingfour Great storage app a little hard to manage files and folders but good for sharing photos and files with large groups
len ratingthree  I like the app but just don t like it when I open the pdf form that is fillable and can t the see the filled content 
len ratingthree I have G suite account I think google should combine google drive and gmail together for easier access with all in one
len ratingfive  Yeah I know that s big praise 
len ratingfive But seriously look at it 
len ratingfive This is a full productivity suite I can use hopping back and forth among my phone work laptop wife s computer my own two office machines whatevah I want to see and work on any of my stuff I jump on the nearest device and go to work 
len ratingfive It s free and it works perfectly every time 
len ratingfive It s kind of insane we can do all this actually 
len ratingfive I keep expecting I ll miss MS Office especially Word s substantially more robust feature set because I make a lot of documentation professionally and I depended on Office for many years 
len ratingfive But it really hasn t happened 
len ratingfive I use Google docs for everything and now I really depend on the universal accessibility Drive affords 
len ratingfive I m not transporting any more files on thumb drive forget it 
len ratingfive Life is easier the birds are chirping 
len ratingfive So thanks Google 
len ratingfive I know you re making a mint off my small contribution to your Big Data collection 
len ratingfive But what the heck I wasn t using that anyway 
len ratingfive And I am using this 
len ratingfive Regards 
len ratingthree Everything is great except There are absolutely no keyboard shortcuts 
len ratingthree Adding keyboard shortcuts would greatly enhance navigation throughout the application 
len ratingthree  Would be incredible if Drive supported iOS s Markup extension for PDFs 
len ratingthree  Very disappointed drag and drop was not included in this last release for iOS 
len ratingthree  If using Google Apps for Business I can t create a share link that is publicly viewable 
len ratingfive  Easy to use 
len ratingfive  Muy buena aplicaci n para documentos
len ratingfive  Saved my life
len ratingtwo  Going back to iCloud 
len ratingtwo Tired of this 
len ratingfive  Enjoy DRIVE can t live without 
len ratingfive So many useful tools
len ratingfive  Great application
len ratingfour  Remove previous review
len ratingfive  Need it 
len ratingfive I can share large files with friends that won t go through email or text 
len ratingfive I love having the convenience of sharing documents wherever I am 
len ratingfive It is so easy to add to emails or work on documents when I am not at home or the office 
len ratingfive Really like this app and I use it everyday 
len ratingfive A place to put anything you want to recover or to review on any device 
len ratingfive Use it to collaborate if you want 
len ratingthree  IPad Air on IOS 
len ratingthree While I uploaded the local files from my laptop open the google drive app on the iPad Air I can see the my computer on the left pop up bar 
len ratingthree But now it disappeared on iOS 
len ratingthree What s going on 
len ratingfour  Google drive is a great cloud storage service 
len ratingfour THAT BEING SAID currently if you try to open docs or ppts from the Apple Files app the documents will open in Google Drive rather than their respective Microsoft office apps 
len ratingfour The only workaround to this currently is uninstalling Google Drive 
len ratingfour Whether this is on Apples end or Googles I m not sure 
len ratingfour I thought I d post this review in hopes that people who have the same issue I ve had might see it and have an easier time figuring it out than I did 
len ratingfive  Yeah I know that s big praise 
len ratingfive But seriously look at it 
len ratingfive This is a full productivity suite I can use hopping back and forth among my phone work laptop wife s computer my own two office machines whatevah I want to see and work on any of my stuff I jump on the nearest device and go to work 
len ratingfive It s free and it works perfectly every time

len ratingfive But what the heck I wasn t using that anyway 
len ratingfive And I am using this 
len ratingfive Regards 
len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingfive  Wonderful
len ratingfour  Good app but it s slow 
len ratingfive  It s a life saver in the Cloud 
len ratingfive  I use it all the time to sync across multiple operating systems 
len ratingfive Indispensable 
len ratingfive  I use Google drive to sync all my important files across computers and make them accessible on the phone 
len ratingfive  Google Drive simple and straight forward cloud storage 
len ratingfive Pretty dope 
len ratingfive Have used it a long time I enjoy the layout and the inexpensive pricing for the upgraded storage 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive  goooooood
len ratingfour I think it could be a little more user friendly 
len ratingfour It s pretty self explanatory but for some it may not be 
len ratingfour It would be nice if they changed the look of the app also 
len ratingone  Updated Review Ever since the recent update last week Google Drive wants to capture any file attempted to be opened opened on Apple s iCloud drive and save it into Google Drive 
len ratingone There is no opt out available you have to shut down the app and delete Google Drive from your iphone if you want to open an iCloud app file 
len ratingone This bug renders the Google Drive app basically useless 
len ratingone I trust Google developers are quickly trying to resolve this problem 
len ratingone  This is a great general storage app but I have found it to be slower in overall syncing than Dropbox or MS one drive 
len ratingone Google needs to take a few lessons from Dropbox and provide faster sync provide password protection for shared links and a few other advantages that DBx has 
len ratingone All need to provide better scaling price plans for needs between Tb and Tb 
len ratingone Why not have Tb plans for a single account also 
len ratingone Or better yet bill users for the actual space used rather than paying for the unused maximum available storage plan 
len ratingone My needs scale up end down and I hate to pay for unused storage 
len ratingone If Google did that I d consolidate all other accounts to Google 
len ratingone By charging users for the maximum storage ceiling rather than the storage space used Google does not need to provide cloud storage hardware for the actual plan need thereby selling unused the same unused storage capacity to multiple users how fair is that 
len ratingone It is like a grocery store charging you for a full shopping cart when there only a few items in it a checkout 
len ratingfive Incredibly handy and simple to use 
len ratingfive This is a must have storage tool to store and share regular non sensitive information 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work Google 
len ratingfour  It is easy to save and organize documents 
len ratingfour Mac docs 
len ratingfour are not able to open in Google unless you have the software apps to open them 
len ratingfive  This is the best thing to have for your files watch access your stuff anywhere any device
len ratingfive  Love this app 
len ratingfive It is the perfect extension of the desktop version 
len ratingfive So easy to use if you are familiar with the desktop version 
len ratingfive It s amazing cloud 
len ratingfour  Excellent
len ratingfive  I couldn t live without it 
len ratingfive  This is a godsend for students 
len ratingfive  Great for movies and photos 
len ratingfive I ve loved using Google Drive 
len ratingfive My favorite part about it is how easy it is to use across multiple devices and computers 
len ratingfive Files I work on or upload from my iPad also appear on my phone laptop any other computer etc 
len ratingfive It makes it simple to pick up where you left off anywhere anytime 
len ratingfive Google Drive is either ridiculously cheap or free 
len ratingfive If you need some cloud storage I recommend this 
len ratingfive Apple is allowing greater compatibility with Drive so it won t be too limiting 
len ratingfive Even more you can easily access files on your computer and phone with it 
len ratingfive As usual Google did a great job so this app runs great too 
len ratingone  Needs an update quick to fix this problem 
len ratingone Any file I attempt to open in iCloud Drive is being opened in google and asking me to save it there 
len ratingone That s no good and never should have been allowed to happen 
len ratingone I thought apps were reviewed 
len ratingfive  Use it all the time 
len ratingfive Easy and powerful 
len ratingfive  Great place to store everything
len ratingfive  I m a fifth grade teacher and have so many files with google drive it is so easy to organize my files 
len ratingfive I love the whole google suit 
len ratingone It freezes up upon uploading from I phone 
len ratingfour Nice
len ratingfour  I m learning how to manage this system although I m from the Microsoft generation 
len ratingfour  Good app
len ratingfour  The app functions as expected
len ratingfive Use this drive all the time 
len ratingfive  Better than iCloud Drive
len ratingfive  Mrs weth google 
len ratingfive Something something something up and at them 
len ratingone Buggy mess of an app 
len ratingone Lost a lot of my files to this not to be trusted with anything of value 
len ratingone A real dud 
len ratingfive  I don t need the quick access feature 
len ratingfive It is ridiculous the there is no option to turn it off 
len ratingfive There is an obvious reason for using folders 
len ratingfive I don t want to see my latest porn popping up on my front page during a meeting 
len ratingfive It s just the best and most practical way to store my photos and important documents 
len ratingfive Without having to carry a flash drive or similar or having to look for things throughout the inbox spam of your mail 
len ratingfive Accessible at any moment with the offline option 
len ratingfive Just love it 
len ratingfour  Great app that is easy to navigate 
len ratingfour Great way to share info with friends and family 
len ratingfour Would like giving permissions to be a little easier but not enough where I wouldn t promote its use 
len ratingfour I recommend it 
len ratingfive Love the the app 
len ratingfive So easy
len ratingfive i absolutely love the google drive
len ratingfive Easily accessible from google
len ratingfive  So easy to use I m in love 
len ratingfive  great job you guys 
len ratingtwo  The fact that I can t save any of my drive photos to my camera roll is bs 
len ratingfour  Having to save images one by one to a phone is annoying 
len ratingfive  Drive has been a Godsend for me for a few years now 
len ratingfive It s got everything I need to help run my personal life and business 
len ratingfive I can produce great documents and access them anywhere 
len ratingfive That is so important 
len ratingfive Google really Got It with this 
len ratingfive Thank you so much and I m always looking forward to new improvements 
len ratingfive Cheers 
len ratingone Every time I try to open a file through the new files app the Google drive app is redirecting me to the Google drive app 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive  Not to mention the interface is easy to understand which makes it easy to organize and find my files 
len ratingfive This is one of my favorite and most frequently used services 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive  This is a great out for you PDFs and anything like documents
len ratingfour  It s a shame that you cannot select more than one file to send to an email nor can you copy and paste more than one file simultaneously 
len ratingfour Other than that it has done me well in the past few years 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is the gold standard for cloud resources 
len ratingfive We have relied on GDocs as the core of LineSync Architecture for creation and storage of our documents such as Sketch Up CAD Text Sheets and Presentations since 
len ratingfive On every level the products continue to improve in their utility and ease of use across all platforms 
len ratingfive It is obvious that the Google Drive team is getting the full support of their parent company Alphabet 
len ratingfive Easy file storing sharing and tracking for individuals or organizations O S independently 
len ratingfive Integrates well with your O S or mobile device 
len ratingfive It became quickly our storage solution 
len ratingfour  When i want to view a picture in full screen on my iphone it takes a long time to load and then it closes the app 
len ratingfour Also generally i ve noticed it takes a very long time to load pictures that has always been an issue that has not been fixed in a very long time i ve used GDrive on my android as well so it has the same loading issue 
len ratingfour I hope it gets fixed 
len ratingfive  Drive is critical to my business 
len ratingfive Have it on all of my devices and don t know what I d do without it 
len ratingthree  I m not sure if it s Google Drive itself or iOS is just making it crash I m just loading images in a folder or gifs and it freezing within seconds and crashes the next seconds 
len ratingthree Can t wait for the fix for the app iOS I love using Google Drive so unfortunately I have to rate it stars for now for this temporary disappointment 
len ratingfive Being able to link Drive with Google Photos makes this the only file storage system i need
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive Use it for all shared documentation within family and for document management of important files 
len ratingthree  Keeps kicking me
len ratingfive  Very pleased with it s functinality 
len ratingfive  You need to get this drive 
len ratingfive It spans multiple platforms and devices giving quick access to your files 
len ratingfive Do yourself a favor get this one 
len ratingfive  Good 
len ratingfive I have found google drive an excellent place to store files for both Android or Apple devices 
len ratingfive  Nice 
len ratingfive  I have been using Google Drive for a long time and have never had any problems
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive It s good if you take a lot of pictures
len ratingfive I run a business and am able to share files with sub contractors 
len ratingfive It is just a great app 
len ratingfive After being a longtime Android exclusive user I finally started using an iPhone and I must say the Google Drive app is working nicely so far 
len ratingfive It has everything that is great about the Google Drive mobile app 
len ratingfive I use it instead of iCloud much better 
len ratingfive I love Drive I love how I can streamline my work and share certain parts of it 
len ratingone For me and of others based on my web search the Google Drive app causes a significant problem with the new IOS File Manager app 
len ratingone When attempting to open any document from File Manager including Word documents in my Apple iCloud file the Google Drive app automatically opens and asks if I want to save that document to Google Drive 
len ratingone That makes the File Manager useless The only fix unfortunately was for me to delete Google Drive 
len ratingone This happened even when I turned off Google Drive in File MAnager Hopefully there will be an Apple or Google fix soon 
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive Always available when you need it and very stable 
len ratingfive The best online or cloud storage service there is 
len ratingfive Google Drive works seamlessly and looks and acts like any other file folder on your computer 
len ratingfive It s the best 
len ratingfive  I find this app to be very useful and convenient 
len ratingfive  I use this for everything work projects lists etc 
len ratingfive It s also a great place to keep resumes and cover letters 
len ratingfive It transitions well from a mobile device to a PC too 
len ratingone  Just a heads up for anyone that uses the iOS Files app a ton like me Drive is hijacking the file opener protocol 
len ratingone Every file you try to preview in Files automatically opens Drive and Drive tries to upload it 
len ratingone This is happening with PDFs docx anything 
len ratingone It s incredibly annoying and very anti user as there doesn t appear to be a way to stop it without deleting the Drive app 
len ratingfive  I enjoy the utility of Google drive 
len ratingfive I am able to store multiple forms of files and able to access them from virtually anywhere 
len ratingfour  It can be improved making it more clear 
len ratingfive Very convenient user friendly and compatible 
len ratingfive  I am not a heavy user but having the availability to access your file anywhere anytime is good 
len ratingfive I have never had a problem
len ratingfive Great accessing from PC and sharing files 
len ratingfive A little more challenging on iPhone but they keep improving the interface with other apps 
len ratingfive I use it everyday 
len ratingfive  Awesome app all files pics everything everywhere on any device 
len ratingfour  ios 
len ratingfive  If you need to access files across multiple devices this app is absolutely essential 
len ratingfive I store all my class readings on the drive and pull them up on my iPad in class 
len ratingfive This app is a lifesaver 
len ratingfive Have had no problems since the update last year very good running app 
len ratingfive Love this makes life easy 
len ratingone  Almost every picture I try to upload it prompts failed to upload 
len ratingone They aren t high in mb or explicit or anything lol 
len ratingone I dont understand 
len ratingfive Couldn t be happier 
len ratingfive  Give star for a great procuct
len ratingfive It s a great way to move pictures off your iPhone since Apple hosed us good when they removed the transfer feature 
len ratingone  Had to delete this app due to its bad behavior 
len ratingone Nasty bug 
len ratingfour Google drive and google photos are easy to use and user friendly 
len ratingfour My sister sends me pictures through these apps and I like it 
len ratingfive  I back up everything with Drive 
len ratingtwo  Update the resolution for iPad pro 
len ratingfive Google drive is a great app 
len ratingfive I use it all the time for all kinds of things 
len ratingfive It s perfect for sharing files and collaboration with others 
len ratingfive  Interface is intuitive and powerful 
len ratingfive  The future actually the present is in the cloud 
len ratingfive This is what is in the cloud 
len ratingfive Google as you might expect is doing huge things to make this work and it does work 
len ratingfive However don t forget that the user has to do their part to make the system work 
len ratingfive Its great for storing and organizing my files and the app has few to no glitches that I ve experienced 
len ratingfive  powerful and easy to use 
len ratingfive It s great for my work stuff 
len ratingfive Easy to access on all my devices 
len ratingone  Any file except for a pdf is opened by default in Google Drive 
len ratingone There is no way to preview files in Apple Files app 
len ratingone This makes it extremely difficult to look through files on Apple Files without having Google Drive asking me to open it in the app EVERY SINGLE TIME 
len ratingone After tackling this issue with an Apple Genius we have concluded that this is indeed an issue on Google s end because the Genius had been able to preview files on Apple Files with an outdated Google Drive app but once the Genius updated the Google Drive app to the newest version it immediately started to have the same issue as I had originally 
len ratingone  In iOS 
len ratingfive Best free cloud storage available 
len ratingfive Keeps pics and most importantly keeps my videos when my daughter was 
len ratingfive  She would make her own videos then She is yrs old now 
len ratingfive I have no problems with the app and I recommend it and most importantly it is FREE 
len ratingfive  Enjoy very much 
len ratingone I had to remove this app from my phone because it kept trying to open and save my iCloud file in Drive they are not on Drive for a reason 
len ratingone If this is fixed so that it doesn t try to boss me around about my personal files anymore I will re evaluate 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  Evaluated several free cloud storage providers this year Google Drive is by far the best 
len ratingfive Over x more storage capacity than others plenty of ways to collaborate without giving out your password 
len ratingfive  Perfect
len ratingfive  I love the compatibility and ease of use
len ratingfour  It s a great app to manage all the documents in my Google accounts which is far more convenient than the desktop version where I can only view and use one account 
len ratingfour There s just one downside which is it doesn t seem to be adapted to the iOS file system on my iPad 
len ratingfour It is now using a share view which seems like a box within the file system 
len ratingfour It would be better if the interface is sort of like the website version with all the folders icon in the built in file system 
len ratingfive I love how convenient it is to take all the files I need with me on the go 
len ratingfive The app is easy to use and I d highly recommend it 
len ratingfive  Best tool for online storage
len ratingfive  Well done Google 
len ratingfive Pretty good 
len ratingfive  Great for ALL documents with the space given unlike the small amount of space iCloud gives you

len ratingfour  Helpful for file transfer and iOS user for sharing files Love this at all
len ratingone  What are you doing hijacking files stored in iCloud Drive 
len ratingone Only workaround is to delete Google Drive app 
len ratingone Don t be so needy to get me to write you a review 
len ratingone All you get is an annoyed customer and a star rating 
len ratingone The only thing I want is a cheaper price 
len ratingfive  It s rather user friendly 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive Thanks for the convenience of Google Drive 
len ratingfive And Google Sheets and slides are fantastic too 
len ratingone  But other than that cool
len ratingfour All of my Office files open seamlessly and problem free 
len ratingfour However the photos downloaded and edited may need more tweaking to make it near flawless 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive I use it for my business and personal accounts have a lot of storage and can be share 
len ratingfive It s the best 
len ratingfive Being able to have access to my school documents from my phone helps tremendously with groups work 
len ratingfive  I couldn t live work volunteer without it
len ratingfive This app helps me with school and non school activities Love it 
len ratingfive  Helpful with my job 
len ratingfive I have been using Google apps for the past years gmail integration with my business email therefore anything I do with my work clients etc are filed and stored under Google Drive 
len ratingfive It s an excellent way of tracking all work flows updated content etc 
len ratingfive The best part is the app which is available on all my IOS devices so pretty convenient especially if I decide to leave my laptop at home 
len ratingone  At this point I have to conclude that Google Drive is a complete non performer 
len ratingone Both my phone and my lap top are up to date but Google Drive will not upload anything even though I have several gigs of storage left 
len ratingfour  I m glad I can access Drive from everywhere 
len ratingfour It has been great for storing information and photos 
len ratingfour I use it a lot 
len ratingfive I ve never had a problem with Google Drive and I use it frequently 
len ratingfive It s seamless and invisible unless I want it 
len ratingfive  Fantastic app can use my world in line
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingfive  I have used multiple cloud based servers and storage but I no longer even look for better options 
len ratingfive I love the way that google drive seamlessly carries from device to device and my business associates can share with me in real time 
len ratingfive  The one and only app which I have been using since ages and still would like to use it in futures as well 
len ratingfive Please don t close your app as it is being shown on the news We all love ur app
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  Very usefull app
len ratingfive  Google Drive is very useful and comes in handy when you need to backup important documents to recover later 
len ratingfive Just in case you don t have a flash drive one can always access Google Drive and retrieve their files

len ratingfive I back up all my important files there 
len ratingfive Highly recommend it 
len ratingfive Safe and secure 
len ratingfive  I like it a lot

len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfour  This is one of the apps that I use to backup my documents and some of my programs and web developments

len ratingfive It provides a central location for my important stuff 
len ratingfive I can create folders structure for different purpose 
len ratingfive It is easy to use 
len ratingfive I can t and won t complain even though it crashes every once in a while and yes photo quality is degraded between uploads and downloads 
len ratingfive Cheers 
len ratingfive  I am a college student and I love that I can work on assignments virtually anywhere anytime and that can collaborate with professors and peers 
len ratingfive  I works like a charm and I love that it works in my laptop and in my phone 
len ratingone  Seriously 
len ratingone Though i made available offline something I can t open it in another app without internet 
len ratingone It says File could not be downloaded 
len ratingone I can open it in drive app without internet but default drive app is not good for opening every file 
len ratingone So each time to open a file in another app it requires internet connection which is disgusting 
len ratingone Change this 
len ratingfive Simplistic to use but very feature rich
len ratingfive  I save many of my videos pictures and documents here 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive They could use a fix up so that whenever it gets overloaded it doesn t just shut down 
len ratingfive But apart from that it s great 
len ratingfive Also they should charge an amount for eternity not yearly or monthly 
len ratingthree  Very solid and dependable 
len ratingthree Issue with opening zip file of photos on iPhone 
len ratingfive I have used google drive for like years and it is just the best 
len ratingfive It has the ability to do documents in word powerpoint or excel format 
len ratingfive The great thing is you can see your google drive from anywhere and even upload photos to it on the spot 
len ratingfive  Excelente
len ratingfour I love having access to my files on any of my devices computers 
len ratingfour I don t like all the access the google world has to my life currently it is worth it to me though 
len ratingfour At times the transfer from Word Excell or others is not quite seamless and the formatting is manipulated slides especially 
len ratingfour So long as I am ready for the need to re set them before printing or presenting it is great 
len ratingfive I use it every single day 
len ratingfive  Good for school
len ratingfive Finally and app where I can keep all my depressing pictures without my mom telling me to delete them all 
len ratingfive I don t ask for much when it comes to the quality of a video or photo 
len ratingfive But I am very stingy when it comes to storage 
len ratingfive This new update helps me so much more 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive  Please
len ratingfive  This is the best tool for collaboration in the entire Apple echosystem 
len ratingfive Wonderful for organizing business AND home 
len ratingfive I created a good Directory so everyone in the family could find the pics they were interested in

len ratingfive  Excellent app
len ratingone  How much space does Google drive have

len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Love it can t live without it 
len ratingone  This version forces me to open excel docs stored on my i cloud drive into Google Drive

len ratingfive Can we get an Amen 
len ratingfive  I use Google drive for all of my business files including storage of archived files and have been able to manage a business from the supplemental files such as Docs and Sheets 
len ratingfive The Google business suite allows for an abundance of storage through drive and as we continue to grow Google Drive continues to meet our needs 
len ratingfive  Honestly super helpful for schooling and it holds all of my files MPs and all of it love it 
len ratingfive  but I hear it is going away

len ratingone  Huge security problem 
len ratingone When I attempt to open a file from my iPad or iPhone it immediately diverts to my Google Drive and asks to save to my gmail account 
len ratingone Worked normally after deleting my Google Drive app 
len ratingone Big problem 
len ratingfive  Easy to find stored docs and use them in gmail 
len ratingfive  Very helpful app 
len ratingfive I use this for work and home and I can t say enough about the features collaboration tools and ease of use 
len ratingfive  Great google app 
len ratingfive Maybe their best service yet

len ratingfive  Liking 
len ratingfive Makes files easy to access from everywhere 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive  Works well priced well always evolving 
len ratingone  Apparently no intentions to address this issue from Google 
len ratingone So sad 
len ratingone This used to be my go to app for photo backups because it used to keep the photo quality and resolution intact without downgrading the resolution much to my disappointment the photo quality is fine when uploading to the drive but now photos are downgraded when you download from Google Drive back to the iPhone 
len ratingone This is very disappointing because it used to keep the fidelity intact 
len ratingone Seems like the new Google Drive app developers are riding in training wheels or cutting corners 
len ratingone Does nobody notice these things or does nobody care 
len ratingone I won t be using this app until this is fixed 
len ratingone So disappointed with this app lately 
len ratingfive  Handy for saving important documents to the cloud 
len ratingfive Don t need to hunt for your portable drive to retrieve files you need while at your bank office or classroom or even at home 
len ratingfour  Great file storage and sharing app that works seamlessly with mobile 
len ratingfour Just remember that anything you put out there is open to the folks at G Their intentions hmmmmm
len ratingfive Free cloud storage easy to use from many devices 
len ratingfive I use an iPad an Android phone a laptop and a desktop and my files are always just there 
len ratingfive  I m efficient and in love with being super efficient 
len ratingfive I love it is easy to use 
len ratingfive Typical Google it just works well thought out and once you ve used it you wonder what you d do without it 
len ratingfour  I was introduced to Drive on my last phone and tablet both Android OS 
len ratingfour So I ve used it extensively since 
len ratingfour My latest phone is an iPhone plus 
len ratingfour I brought over my Google Drive thankfully since the App Store had an iOS version 
len ratingfour Now I m learning my way around transferring iPhone photos to Drive and being able to access the files as needed 
len ratingfour That s where I m at 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I use it for school and for my personal account 
len ratingfive It s clean simple intuitive and very organized 
len ratingfive By far one of the best things to have 
len ratingfive Some More things Shared between all devices Good for storing documents from your computer to your phone Store documents AND photos just in case your phone gets ruined
len ratingone I had this collage paper it lost the paper and everything thing else and then the app won t save my papers if I were you I wouldn t waste my space on this app instead get apple stuff or roblox 
len ratingone I GIVE THIS APP A 
len ratingone Prior to today s update when I open an Excel or Word file from iCloud Drive NOT from Google Drive the file will be opened within iCloud Drive 
len ratingone Now when the same files are opened Google Drive will TAKE OVER and FORCE YOU to copy the file to Google Drive 
len ratingone This is a security issue because there are files that I do NOT want to copy to Google Drive 
len ratingone Google should NOT force user to open Excel file stored in NON Google Drive app in Google Drive 
len ratingtwo Every time that I try to view a PDF the app crashes 
len ratingtwo I can read the PDF for about seconds 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is a lot of cloud storage space for free Easy to use and web interface for anyone who needs it It s great for transferring files on my desktop that I want to access from my phone or iPad without much work

len ratingfive A delight to have on my phone

len ratingfive Access to everything from anywhere for free 
len ratingfive Hard to beat 
len ratingthree  All is well with the app it has enough functionality one can imagine to use in an iPhone but why is it so unstable 
len ratingthree I downloaded the most recent version today and within the first minutes of starting to upload something it crashed times 
len ratingfive  Easy to use 
len ratingfive Easy to share 
len ratingfive Perfect file sharing storing program 
len ratingfive  Easy to use and quick to sync 
len ratingfive I use this app everyday and I find it to be reliable and useful on the iOS platform 
len ratingfive  this app and software is very useful for backup 
len ratingfive but the main amazing feature of google drive is the ability of convert the text photo to text document in any language specially persian
len ratingfive Works well on iPad very useful for creating and editing documents 
len ratingfive This app rocks 
len ratingfive I use it all the time to review docs or refer to shared items on the spot 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and major time saver
len ratingfive  I cannot began to explain how much and how often I use this app

len ratingfive  This thing is the best like hands down it gets my stuff done and is organized and pretty like dang man I like it
len ratingfive  Using for all data needs and sharing 
len ratingfive They should option of adding entire folder off line access on device 
len ratingfive  I used Drive to archive my family photos 
len ratingfive As it turns out it s integrated with Google photos and Google Photos does all kinds of fun things with my photos and videos automatically 
len ratingfive It makes edited video clips sorts them into galleries separate from how I have them organized in Drive which is nice 
len ratingfive It s the first Google product I ve ever bought into with money and I like it enough I ll probably go with a vanilla Android next 
len ratingfour  I am happy with how it works 
len ratingfour I use it across accounts and like the way I can login to each account right from the menu

len ratingfour  The free storage is more than enough for all my storage necessities 
len ratingfive  Awesome but would recommend a scanner app tool that would be great

len ratingfive Great app to store whatever you need 
len ratingfour  I am very happy with this app 
len ratingfour I m able to store lots of files on it 
len ratingfour There s a lot of room and I have managed to get things easily organized 
len ratingfour It is not very difficult to move files to change their name or to share them which is nice 
len ratingfour Some problems I run into include weird temporary files taking over my folders 
len ratingfour This is something I run into outside of the app too 
len ratingfour Google Drive does this thing where it creates tons of temporary files when you open a file and clogs up your space 
len ratingfour This can make things very confusing when you re trying to sort through files on this app 
len ratingfour Also I accidentally deleted a bunch of pictures one time and didn t even realize it so I m very careful when I m on the app not to click things 
len ratingfour Dropbox is definitely preferred but there s not enough space on there for me to just use it 
len ratingfour Drive has met all my needs without too many issues 
len ratingfive  Works great
len ratingfour The GDrive app is good 
len ratingfour Very good in fact it s just a little tough to navigate sometimes 
len ratingfour Still recommend it highly
len ratingfive  I enjoy being able to share files with others and even with embedded links 
len ratingfive This app works efficiently 
len ratingfive It is easy to use 
len ratingfive Love having space to save files and access them from anywhere 
len ratingfive  Geniu 
len ratingone  The older version didn t have this issue now that every time I save a photo from Drive it compresses it and the quality is significantly reduced 
len ratingone I can t believe no one else has noticed this issue
len ratingone I chose a select few photos to upload from my camera roll on iPhone and it uploaded the entire camera roll 
len ratingone I then had to go one by one and delete them all 
len ratingone To top it all off Google Drive does not always display properly in Chrome hindering its functionality 
len ratingfive  The interface was easy to use and intuitive 
len ratingfive I love the drag and drop feature which makes uploading my files and pictures a breeze 
len ratingfive It s nice to be able to access my files from any device anywhere I go 
len ratingfive Highly recommend to others 
len ratingfive Makes it so easy to share photos docs etc with friends and family 
len ratingfive Very user friendly and you can add folders to keep it organized 
len ratingfive Absolutely love this app 
len ratingfive  Thank you for keeping everything safe 
len ratingfive  I like that you can see folders that others have shared with you 
len ratingfive Simple but flexible 
len ratingfive  Great storage service
len ratingfive Good adaptation of web browser based service 
len ratingfive Works well easy to understand 
len ratingfive On occasion I take my notes in class with it and it deals with that well 
len ratingone  It just doesn t work at all 
len ratingfive Simply great
len ratingfive  Love the access to all of my files from any where and any device 
len ratingfive  As an old android and google apps lover I find this app very useful for storing fotos taken from my phone and saving homework 
len ratingfive  Works well
len ratingfive  I like this
len ratingfive Fiels at the fingertips anywhere anytime 
len ratingfive I m super satisfied with this app 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive It s faster than having to hook up my phone to a compute to transfer photos 
len ratingfive  I ve had this app since th grade and i am now a sophomore 
len ratingfive I can access every picture from all those years and have storage on my phone for more memories to come 
len ratingfive It s a great app to look back on as the years go by and to post some throwbacks 
len ratingfive Just heard this App is getting canned 
len ratingfive I must not know how to use google drive but i like drop box better because i can not save to a specific folder 
len ratingfive I have to save to drive then go through hastle of moving file to the point im tired if using gdrive
len ratingfour  Google Drive is an incredibly useful to go and this app is a great extension of it 
len ratingfour With it I can access all my files whenever I have my iPad 
len ratingfour It would be nice if there was more support for different file types but you can open files and other apps so there s normally another option 
len ratingfive  I like it because it helps me to carry my documents any where and time 
len ratingfour Use this app all the time and hasn t failed me yet 
len ratingfour Thought wen I got an iPhone that I wouldn t be able to control my documents on it but wit this app I can just as well as my android phones
len ratingfive Thank you so much for this program 
len ratingfive Biggest plus for me is having my information accessible from multiple devices 
len ratingfive  This is simply the most useful app on my phone 
len ratingone AVOID I used this for months with day after day of troubles 
len ratingone What a mess 
len ratingfive Great storage
len ratingthree  The greatest cloud drive ever 
len ratingthree Does exactly as stated 
len ratingthree The only single thing I would change is allowing the drive to be more mobile friendly and give access to add attachments as a direct attachment or actually the format the document is in prior to it being the drive 
len ratingthree The only downfall to the application is the document is always part of the drive and an attachment requires people to access your drive and have permission 
len ratingthree Very sad 
len ratingthree Lastly the documents become Google formatted and can be viewed by the recipient as a Google Doc or Google Sheet 
len ratingthree If the Drive allowed standard attachments in original format it would be flawless 
len ratingthree I am always told anything attached from the Drive can t be viewed easily or the format can t be taken in 
len ratingthree Most things sent from my Drive are not received or viewed easily if at all even when permissions are given 
len ratingthree Finally it does not work with sites like LinkedIn or any API based platforms 
len ratingthree The attachments from the Drive are automatically marked as an unreadable format 
len ratingthree It is very very very sad for a company like Google to have this problem 
len ratingthree I waited a year to write this review in hopes this was fixed but it has not been 
len ratingfive It works for me a lot it s practical for me I really like it a lot
len ratingfive  Got to download it make your pictures safe and easy to have it anywhere at anytime you need them 
len ratingfive  Love Google Drive and the ease of using it and the ability to share 
len ratingfive  Can back up home network carry work docs and transfer across domains
len ratingfive Useful app from Google
len ratingfive  Google drive is the best app if you are in the field of education 
len ratingfive It organizes rearranges allows easy access to all your files and most importantly allows sharing and collaboration and use with your mobile iPads and laptop etc 
len ratingfive I could not work as efficiently without it 
len ratingfive And many more 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive  Anything and everything I need at my fingertips all the time 
len ratingfive Can not live without Drive 
len ratingfive One of the money google tools I absolutely need in my day to day lizzle

len ratingfive Edit files using google word or excel

len ratingfive Peace 
len ratingfour  Works good 
len ratingfive  It s gotten so much better that I ve stopped using other apps to access this one

len ratingfive The ability to share files with computer phone and tablet seamlessly is great 
len ratingfive Drive is fantastic in its ability to utilize other Google applications 
len ratingfive  Great app use it once a month
len ratingthree Here s what you need

len ratingthree If Apple won t allow that then at least I should be able to chromecast my media from Drive 
len ratingthree I d be able to live with that 
len ratingthree Get to work Google 
len ratingfive  I always use this app 
len ratingfive It s very convenient for saving and loading between your phone and your computer 
len ratingfive I don t have to worry about taking my usb or my computer with me anymore 
len ratingone  It used to work but the update lately made it impossible to download full resolution images

len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingfour  Great way to backups photos and save stuff 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive  Really easy to share docs pics and slides 
len ratingfive Just a tap and poof done 
len ratingfive  I am a school teacher and needed a way to see my files at school and when I am away 
len ratingfive I can access this anywhere I am even on vacation 
len ratingfive Paired with Google Classroom my students are always current and connected to me 
len ratingfour  Love this app as it provides me access to my documents from my iPhone 
len ratingfour App occasionally won t access a doc in drive and I fault Mac OS more than Google 
len ratingfive  use it all the time to pull up documents
len ratingtwo There is a list of your documents 
len ratingtwo Top of the column shows Name But its not clickable or sortable 
len ratingtwo Is this some kind of a joke 
len ratingtwo Windows could sort documents 
len ratingtwo and I m pretty sure OS before could too 
len ratingtwo Speechless 
len ratingtwo Almost 
len ratingfour  Uploading streaming sharing and integration with other apps big plus stars if the price would compete with the other top cloud storage apps
len ratingfive  Save space in my phone and I can keep forever
len ratingfive This is a perfect app to give me access to my docs while on the move 
len ratingone  I went skydiving and they gave me a link with a username and password to log in and download my video and pics of my adventure 
len ratingone But this app does not provide me with a log in screen 
len ratingone Where and how can I get my video that I paid to purchase 
len ratingone Can anybody help 
len ratingone I just want my memories 
len ratingfive  Yeah the whole thing is amazing
len ratingfour  recomendable podr an mejorar algunos aspectos 
len ratingfive Love being able to sign into drive and other Google apps with ONE password username 
len ratingfive Can access files anywhere 
len ratingfive  Very useful 
len ratingfive An improvement would be availability to sort and list files by date of file creation versus when last opened modified etc 
len ratingfive  My every day driver 
len ratingfive Makes life easier

len ratingfive Which help me easily find my documents

len ratingfour But it s getting there
len ratingfour  It s cool
len ratingfive  It works perfect
len ratingone  The update finally downloaded after many tries in many days 
len ratingone But what I would like to know is why the photos are not loading on the screen 
len ratingone I was hoping the update would have fixed this problem but it did not 
len ratingone I know I ve used up the allotted space even though it says unlimited 
len ratingone I really like this app and it s very easy to use and I would gladly pay the for the year but I am leery since the pictures are not loading 
len ratingone I have a brand new iPad with plenty of memory and space so it can t be that 
len ratingone Any answers anybody 
len ratingone I would gladly give it five stars if it would work properly 
len ratingone Maybe four stars since it says unlimited since it says unlimited and it doesn t seem to be the case even though I do have it set for unlimited in the settings 
len ratingone  The update looks like it s almost done downloading and then I get this pop up that says Google Drive and cloud storage could not be downloaded at this time This has been happening for a couple of days now

len ratingfour I m never looking back again 
len ratingfour The only issue I have is creating folders and copying files to them at the Windows explorer level has to be redone with the app to be available on my mobile devices 
len ratingfour Other than that I m a big fan 
len ratingfour Thanks Google 
len ratingfive  So many uses for this app 
len ratingfive I ve got crochet patterns recipes and my resume saved 
len ratingfive I can attach to an email when I need to

len ratingfive  Drive is a great app 
len ratingfive Love being able to easily upload pictures and clear room on my phone 
len ratingfive  I describe it in on word Awesome 
len ratingone  This app is total garbage 
len ratingone Ads pop up every seconds 
len ratingone As I write this review 
len ratingone It pops up a notification to make me think I submitted it 
len ratingone The iPhone is getting to a point where it s becoming a useless device that can t even deliver content because it s too busy spamming me with ads nonsense and trash 
len ratingone This app represents the worst of these apps 
len ratingone If I could beat Tim Cook into a bloody mess for allowing this I d take great pleasure in doing so 
len ratingone This will be my last iPhone as most apps are like this now 
len ratingone Garbage 
len ratingone A dollar pile of garbage 
len ratingone  Apple where they breathe

len ratingfive  As a box holding stuff this app does a splendid job 
len ratingfive Smooth clean easy a real good storage device 
len ratingfive  For useful and productive 
len ratingthree Frustrating if you actually use the document settings 
len ratingthree Save offline star favorite etc are great options but they re limited to individual documents 
len ratingthree There s no select menu to change all at once and no setting to change folder contents either 
len ratingthree Changing one doc at a time is very time consuming 
len ratingthree Auto saves to main folder so you have to move documents yourself and do so after each upload bc again there s no batch edit 
len ratingthree Needs go to page number bookmarks 
len ratingfour Nice app but I d like this app to let me switch songs whit my headphones it doesn t have the random play option nice app but it would be great just if it worked like a multimedia player

len ratingfive  This is great
len ratingfive  Collaborative work without headaches 
len ratingfive Seamless
len ratingtwo  I m a photographer and was somewhat distraught to see that I cannot save original quality photos stored in my Drive onto my iPhone 
len ratingtwo Rather than simply downloading the image file to my phone for some reason the app puts it through a round of non optional jpeg compression first 
len ratingtwo And I m on wi fi so data is no issue 
len ratingtwo Totally unnecessary Google 
len ratingtwo Please let me have my original images 
len ratingfive This app is amazing 
len ratingfour Love this app would love to be able to send photo from Google drive directly to instagram like in the android version

len ratingfive I use google for several reasons 
len ratingfive One is that of all companies there s stands to be seeping for a long time to come 
len ratingfive I don t want all my stuff on the servers of a company that will not exist years from now 
len ratingfive I could go on and on listing the merits 
len ratingfive Let me just say 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Works flawlessly 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone What an unreliable broken app 
len ratingone If you try to export documents it fails every single time 
len ratingone If you convert the documents to another format you better get a beer or because you will grow a full beard before it finishes 
len ratingone Also trying to open a power point is probably the best test of a person s patience I have ever seen 
len ratingone You get only blank slides 
len ratingone So if you hate yourself and haven t found a reason to end it all yet get this app
len ratingfour  Should be download multiples PDFs files

len ratingfive My second account is for work

len ratingfive And it does so without effort 
len ratingfive Not to mention the ease of working with Google Docs and Sheets between PC iPad and iPhone 
len ratingfive Sharing photos and videos is an added benefit 
len ratingfive Backing up data is the best

len ratingfive I grew a full head of hair and inches taller granted that may have nothing to do with downloading the app but my point is it might 
len ratingfive I also lost pounds but that s because my stupid brother made me do a juice cleanse for a full year which I don t suggest it is really unhealthy

len ratingfive  Remember when buying Word for Windows was expensive 
len ratingfive I do 
len ratingfive  Easy to use and nice to be able to have all my documents on my cell phone
len ratingone  Apparently no intentions to address this issue from Google 
len ratingone This used to be my go to app for photo backups because it used to keep the photo quality and resolution intact without downgrading the resolution much to my disappointment the photo quality is fine when uploading to the drive but now photos are downgraded when you download from Google Drive back to the iPhone 
len ratingone This is very disappointing because it used to keep the fidelity intact 
len ratingone Seems like the new Google Drive app developers are riding in training wheels or cutting corners 
len ratingone Does nobody notice these things or does nobody care 
len ratingone I won t be using this app until this is fixed 
len ratingone So disappointed with this app lately 
len ratingfive Great app I use it all the time at work 
len ratingfive Very effective and fast couldn t ask for more right now 
len ratingfour I like this program very much

len ratingfive Google drive allows seamless integration between my desktop and my tablets which is something I use all the time 
len ratingfour  Well I love google and I use Drive on a daily basis 
len ratingfour The app is stable 
len ratingfour Just a minor bug When you open a file from another app in Drive if this app isn t running in the background already then it won t work the st time 
len ratingfour You ll have to come back to the other app to try again and the file when saved in Drive will be renamed as original filename Other than that I only wish it ll load video a little faster

len ratingfive  Very practical
len ratingfive  I use it constantly to keep documents and photos available across multiple devices and to collaborate easily with others

len ratingfive As an agent always on the go Google Drive is a lifesaver 
len ratingfive I can easily share docs with other agents and my files are available no matter where I am or what device I am using

len ratingfive  After using Drive on a personal level I was really impressed and converted our office to the Google ecosystem 
len ratingfive Well worth the switch and couldn t be any happier 
len ratingfive Our converted clients feel the same way 
len ratingtwo Videos that are visible and playable on other devices and also other apps that can access GDrive are stuck in processing within this app 
len ratingtwo Can download the same videos through this app and play them in them in IOS but not in the app itself anymore

len ratingfive I can t believe I went so long without using this 
len ratingfive App seems to integrate with links in other applications as I would expect

len ratingfive Drive makes document creation and storage on a smartphone intuitive let alone possible probably something that should have been built into mobile platforms from the start

len ratingfive I am loving it

len ratingfive  I love this app because it allows me to have a cloud storage platform for my phone tablet computer and my other devices 
len ratingfive I strongly recommend it 
len ratingfive  I live the ease in which I can access my documents on the fly using my phone instead if having to sit down and open up my laptop 
len ratingfive  As a high school teacher and football coach I found google team drives to be the very best way to get information to students and to teachers 
len ratingfive The team drive allows multiple people to join and share everything from files to film 
len ratingfive It has helped me and saved me so much time and energy 
len ratingfive Highly recommend making the move 
len ratingfour  Good cloud storage option but the app needs support for office documents too as google docs doesn t satisfy all requirement at times 
len ratingfive  Love to work with google drive 
len ratingfive Actually let s me upload videos sharing is easy and organizing is easy
len ratingfive  This is probably the most invaluable productivity app I have

len ratingfive  This app is so convenient when I am on the go and have to share or update a doc 
len ratingfive Beneficial for any go getter 
len ratingfive  The best ever cloud solution for documents 
len ratingfive  great for storing lots of info nd files
len ratingfive Haven t used it for photos but music and music charts text files its been great 
len ratingthree  I feel as though there are many opportunities to enhance their apps especially in the iPad space that are just not taken advantage of 
len ratingthree Assigning tasks in Google docs is easy yet there is not any one location where you can look at all the tasks you have been assigned 
len ratingthree The notification screen in the Google Drive app is red but doesn t go away when you view the notifications 
len ratingfive This feature is definitely what makes Google head and shoulders above everybody else 
len ratingfive I have been using Google Drive now for several years 
len ratingfive It is my go to writing program because I have always been able to go between my iPad and my PC with written papers with ease 
len ratingfive Google Drive also makes PDF downloads easy 
len ratingfour  I use google drive for my courses teaching and it s seamless working with google docs sheets etc is very convenient

len ratingthree  Review
len ratingfive  Simple to use and easy to access
len ratingfive  Z best
len ratingfive  It s a wonderful app
len ratingfour  Google Drive is my preferred way to share large numbers of high res photos or large video files too large to email 
len ratingfour With the ability to limit access to particular folders within Drive I can determine who has access to which files 
len ratingfour The only trouble I ve had is that sometimes the desktop app stops syncing for no apparent reason 
len ratingfour Exiting and then restarting the app will resume the sync but this shouldn t happen at all 
len ratingfour I have to say that it seems to happen less with Windows than it used to and it s not a particularly frequent occurrence anyway 
len ratingfour If it weren t for this minor issue I d give it a star rating 
len ratingfour  I love the ease of sharing docs with groups and referencing info as I am on the go 
len ratingfour My one problem is that PDF with form fill in content does not show the filled content 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive  Excellent way to transfer and store documents 
len ratingfive Available on multiple platforms 
len ratingfive  As someone pursuing film this app is amazing 
len ratingfive I can upload video from my phone and grab it right at my computer 
len ratingfive Makes transfer of files a breeze but render time is a little slow which is to be expected 
len ratingfive Other than that no complaints come to mind 
len ratingfive Good luck on your endeavors 
len ratingfive Awesome can save all documents with ease
len ratingfive  It s a great way to stay in shape 
len ratingfive F cil conveniente perfecta 
len ratingfive  Recommend
len ratingone  Wrote a review for the last update talking about how the photo quality becomes downgraded whenever you save it to the camera roll 
len ratingone This is highly annoying because I upload photos from my Canon camera which takes pictures with amazing quality 
len ratingone NOT USING DRIVE UNTIL THIS IS FIXED 
len ratingone Seriously don t understand why they would take this feature away 
len ratingfive  I just moved a bunch of gigs of files from my hard drive to my google drive 
len ratingfive I cannot believe it was an easy click and drag and it was instantaneously there 
len ratingfive Now I can access my files on my phone at any time 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Fantastic Can t live without this valuable tool You can take where ever you go Easy to use I think this is the best program out there Plus Google is very dependable I give it S Lee Hersh
len ratingfive Great free cloud storage option 
len ratingfive  Al m de espa o gratuito o aplicativo bem amig vel 
len ratingfive Como a Apple peca muito nesse quesito importante ter uma nuvem para seus arquivos 
len ratingfive O app est bem integrado ao ios e outros aplicativos 
len ratingfive Aten o quanto ao arquivamento de fotos pois alguns relataram diminui o da resolu o 
len ratingfive N o tive esse problema pois uso o Google photos 
len ratingfive Mas caso ocorra creio que uma mitiga o seja zipar o aquivo 
len ratingfive Ah necess rio uma conta no Google para usar o Drive 
len ratingfive  Years ago I was a loyal Dropbox fan but the lack of memory makes Google Drive my new clear answer

len ratingfive Love it i can save my videos with no problem easy to use 
len ratingfive  Extremely convenient to store and edit docs from any version of drive 
len ratingfive I like Google Drive a lot 
len ratingfive Install it on your PC and it looks like a hard disk for copy and paste 
len ratingfive Print from Chrome to Google Drive and all you read on the Web is conserved as a PDF file at the same place 
len ratingfive Google Drive works from all your devices 
len ratingfive  In my humble opinion Google Drive is simply the greatest thing since sliced bread 
len ratingfive It has made so much of my business so much easier than I could ever have imagined 
len ratingfive  If you have an entire IT team and high security requirements the Office apps are probably a better choice 
len ratingfive But if it s just Me Myself and Irene running the show this app will keep you from pulling out your hair 
len ratingfive And you ll actually be able to find your documents when you need to 
len ratingfive  I have found this app so helpful as a library for storing instructions new item listings diagrams reference guides and many other things including pictures that all my co workers can utilize 
len ratingfive It becomes a good resource to draw upon 
len ratingfive I found it helpful for family pictures also for the whole family to look at 
len ratingfive And I can keep this separate from work access ability 
len ratingfive  I use the docs as my only word processor 
len ratingfive It is current and easy to use share 
len ratingfive  It is the best way to keep every thing in reach
len ratingfive  Excelente 
len ratingfive  My daily used at work home car music I guess everywhere 
len ratingfive Google Drive is the Best Cloud Storage available 
len ratingfive When you couple the entire suite of Google products together it is the most complete package of productivity tools available and Free also

len ratingfive Thank you for making google drive so helpful 
len ratingfive Use it multiple times a day to collaborate with multiple people 
len ratingfive  Great place to save and organize your PDFs and files 
len ratingfive  Once I found out I could have unlimited space with a G Suite account for per email per month I immediately dropped Dropbox at per month and switch 
len ratingfive The interface and user friendly ness of the app and online app is better in every way 
len ratingfive  Save and organize everything in the drive 
len ratingfive good to use mobile
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingone I used to be able to drop pics and videos to the cloud and grab them on my phone 
len ratingone But since the last update it takes over hours for it to process and then it won t let me download to my device

len ratingone Very frustrated with the app right now

len ratingone Now my files are not accessible

len ratingone Loved it 
len ratingone But it was a complete disaster for me when I was heading out to work uploaded everything to g drive only to find out whe I was done editing downloaded photos that all of my dslr photos were downsized to xpx or so

len ratingfour Use it as my personal go to for cloud storage instead of Dropbox 
len ratingfour Just wish it didn t crash when reading large PDF files 
len ratingfive Instead of just saving everything to your phone tablet laptop you should save to Drive as well 
len ratingfive Then should you need to access your saved documents from another location simply open the app everything is saved in one convenient place 
len ratingfive  Best app ever
len ratingfive  Not perfection just an easy to use service that seems to have all the right options FOR FREE 
len ratingfive Thanks so much 
len ratingone  Apparently no intentions to address this issue from Google 
len ratingone This used to be my go to app for photo backups because it used to keep the photo quality and resolution intact without downgrading the resolution much to my disappointment the photo quality is fine when uploading to the drive but now photos are downgraded when you download from Google Drive back to the iPhone 
len ratingone This is very disappointing because it used to keep the fidelity intact 
len ratingone Seems like the new Google Drive app developers are riding in training wheels or cutting corners 
len ratingone I won t be using this app until this is fixed 
len ratingone So disappointed with this app lately 
len ratingone  cannot view shared images for me this app is useless
len ratingfive  I own a tablet and chrome book and this is so nice to be able to access my docs on both platforms 
len ratingfive The Best
len ratingfive  Very easy to log on and use for data storage or important documents 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive  I have used it for several years and it has been great 
len ratingfive  Great app and easy to use 
len ratingfive  Google facilitates Everything for You 
len ratingfive  couldn t ask for more 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive  Powerful cross platform document editor 
len ratingfive Curious about Google s privacy and financial incentives then again I am no expert anyhoo it works well for school documents and projects
len ratingone The app did not update the database that I ve modified from computer 
len ratingone The stupid thing 
len ratingfive  Nice app
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingthree  When I import or export music files it takes a while especially with mps or zips photos like jpegs take seconds which I don t mind another problem is on iphone whenever I m importing or exporting something it fails when my phone powers off or falls asleep on Android I can still be importing and exporting while my phone is powered off or sleep please fix this
len ratingtwo I can barely use the app every time I open it 
len ratingtwo It always shows a white screen with a blue button in the lower right hand corner which is its way of adding files
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive I do everything in word and excel 
len ratingfive It s easy for me to share with important people and also access from any device
len ratingthree  I save music on google drive and most of the audio files don t even play 
len ratingthree They almost always used to but for some reason Drive won t play them 
len ratingthree And then I tried to download a rd party app so I could listen to the songs but the files won t load because google doesn t allow it 
len ratingthree Ugh 
len ratingone  There are better alternatives that just happen to be from companies that aren t quite as far left fascist and bigoted as google anyway 
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour I use it for all my stuff 
len ratingfour Best price for storage and features 
len ratingfour New ability to select and move multiple items is great 
len ratingfour I would love it if I could view my google docs within the app and then open them in the other apps when I wanted to edit That would make this stars to me 
len ratingone  App is slow to sign in and is now downloading all my pictures from my phone to my drive that I already have saved 
len ratingone Should recognized they are already saved 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingthree  c mon guys you fix the quality and drop gif and video support then fix gifs and videos and drop quality 
len ratingthree long pictures show up blurry when i save them back to my camera roll 
len ratingthree and please add an option to hide the quick access tool it s really annoying 
len ratingone  Playing video from the drive doesn t work 
len ratingone It crashes after minutes 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone Also offline video files can t be played after update
len ratingthree  This app has gone downhill 
len ratingthree I used to love it but today I was looking at my photos and noticed a bunch of them rotated on me 
len ratingthree There is no shortcut for selecting photos and rotating them in batches 
len ratingthree You have to go one by one and it takes clicks to rotate EACH photo 
len ratingone  Start over with new app 
len ratingfive  We use it for work it is super easy to work with have quick access to it whenever 
len ratingone  Fire an employee for having a diverse view point 
len ratingone Delete this leftist garbage and move on 
len ratingfive I am a blogger and work in drive 
len ratingfive Amazing to make edits from anywhere when a thought occurs 
len ratingfive A little clunky on the phone app but couldn t imagine working without it 
len ratingfive  Great tool for free cloud storage 
len ratingfive Files are well organized and it is very easy to use 
len ratingone I log in in my google account but for some reason my videos and Photos won t load up I patiently waited until it loads but never came up 
len ratingone I basically wasted my time uploading nothing 
len ratingone I wouldn t recommend it
len ratingone I can t download let alone view a video saved in my account 
len ratingone I was also unable to download the video through gmail even by clicking on the download option which only took me to an even more bare window to simply watch the video again 
len ratingfour  I love this app but I wish I could edit my stuff on it that would save me s lot of space but other way I love this app
len ratingfive Use it for teaching learning and living 
len ratingone  Cant generate links easily poor design interface
len ratingone  Cannot open any google docs or sheets in the drive unless you separately download google docs and google sheets
len ratingone My own ftp server when does a better job than Google s 
len ratingone Moreover why doesn t Drive have a built in photo editor 
len ratingone They should at least give us the option to rotate photos 
len ratingone  There are better choices for cloud storage 
len ratingone I d rather choose one from a company that isn t bigoted and fascist like google is 
len ratingone  This is a good app on Android devices but is missing a lot of features on the iPhone version 
len ratingone I do not recommend it 
len ratingone Garbage log into website on computer and upload files 
len ratingone Log into app on mobile and shows nothing have checked almost hourly for past days restarted phone 
len ratingone Never syncs no matter what making it totally useless
len ratingfour Good but need more improvement 
len ratingfour Like folder password or fingerprint option 
len ratingfive  I m a Middle School student and this app does everything I need 
len ratingfive My school uses Google Apps for Education for most online assignments such as presentations or written assignments 
len ratingfive This app is a great place to see all of my folders Docs Slides and pictures videos 
len ratingfive It has everything I need in one place and I can add to it from here too 
len ratingfive I can creat new files upload new pictures and videos and do everything I could do on a computer right from this iPad Air 
len ratingfive I have no suggestions for this app so I am rating it five stars 
len ratingfive Thanks and keep up the great work Google 
len ratingone  I always have trouble uploading larger files 
len ratingone Once in awhile it works but times out of it freezes or fails 
len ratingthree  I hope there would be download on the option bar soon because I would to download stuff on my phone instead of put it on offline
len ratingfive  Great 
len ratingfive Wonderful app that does everything I need it too 
len ratingone Through the years no improvement on the iPhone app super slow after minutes no preview icons for the folder with files 
len ratingone  Slow uploads 
len ratingone ui is all over the place and difficult to navigate 
len ratingone typical google software 
len ratingone Onedrive is way smoother in function
len ratingone  Got it to download photos easier from my drive rather than emailing them all and it doesn t even let save them to my phone 
len ratingone I hold down and it says Save to Camera Roll And it doesn t 
len ratingone Unable to authenticate user when I try to log in 
len ratingone It also crashes when I delete photos 
len ratingone This is my go to app for backing up my photos 
len ratingone Guess I ll have to look for something else 
len ratingone  App loads files very slowly 
len ratingone When it comes to downloading videos on iPhone they never complete never saving to camera roll 
len ratingone Pictures and videos take their time loading up 
len ratingone Used to be a good app not no more 
len ratingtwo  you guys really need to get the size of this app under control 
len ratingtwo all the google app are way way too big 
len ratingtwo  I tried restarting my phone deleting the app and re downloading it but I still cannot open the app 
len ratingtwo This is a shame since I always use this app 
len ratingtwo  The only thing missing is the ability to scan to PDF like it s android counterpart and box still have to use box just for this reason 
len ratingtwo Thanks
len ratingone  Just shows a play button with a strike through it 
len ratingone Playback works on my mac and PC but not on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo  This app is missing the ability to scan documents to PDF using the camera only JPEG 
len ratingtwo The Google Drive app for the other mobile operating system has this feature as does Dropbox for iOS 
len ratingtwo It s the only thing missing for me but it s a big one 
len ratingone  This app will opened automatically by your browser without even asking you all drive s links in browser will automatically opened with this app even if you open it again and again 
len ratingone  Photos that I upload from my DSLR camera save onto my iPhone camera roll with noticeably reduced quality 
len ratingone This is really irritating seeing as this wasn t an issue before 
len ratingone I used this app solely for the fact that the picture quality was saved the same and it was efficiently easy to save them as well 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone  Can t even download the videos you ve uploaded to it anymore
len ratingfive I love it I just wish you didn t have to download slides docs spreadsheets etc 
len ratingfive separately to make quick edits on them 
len ratingfive Besides that this app is great 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a great free service that in my opinion is the best that is out there 
len ratingfive Drive enables me to upload and download files anytime anywhere 
len ratingfive As an EMT I use it a lot for patient signatures 
len ratingfive Never let me down 
len ratingfive Good job guys 
len ratingfive  This app needs just one thing to be perfect 
len ratingfive It needs an option that lets you enter the page number that you want to go to in the document instead of scrolling down 
len ratingone  This used to be my go to app for photo backups because it used to keep the photo quality and resolution intact without downgrading the resolution much to my disappointment the photo quality is fine when uploading to the drive but now photos are downgraded when you download from Google Drive back to the iPhone 
len ratingone This is very disappointing because it used to keep the fidelity intact 
len ratingone Seems like the new Google Drive app developers are riding in training wheels or cutting corners 
len ratingone I won t be using this app until this is fixed 
len ratingone So disappointed with this app lately 
len ratingthree  I ve been using Drive to save videos I make in Sony Vegas 
len ratingthree It has been working fine until after my third video 
len ratingthree When I upload the video to drive it tells me the video is processing but never completes the processing 
len ratingthree I also try to export it to my phone it doesn t save due to it not being processed 
len ratingthree If you could fix this I would give it five stars 
len ratingfive Cannot say enough good things 
len ratingfive Don t know how their business model works but the value to cost ratio dramatically favors their customers 
len ratingfive Throw in easy to use and it s a no brainer 
len ratingtwo  This app is not updating 
len ratingtwo I had seven apps ready to update and all but this app updated fine 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo Thanks J Dodson
len ratingthree  Doesnt make pdf
len ratingthree  other app developers care about their customers 
len ratingtwo  Google employees can see what is in your drive whenever they want 
len ratingtwo You re better off carrying a USB flash drive 
len ratingfive  Easiest app to share and collaborate with documents videos flyers and more on the cloud 
len ratingfive Just upload your document and then share it with your audience 
len ratingfive Also great for backing up important photos and stuff from your iPhone 
len ratingfive  It has improved allot minus the fact that not all my offline files or offline 
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour I use it for all my stuff 
len ratingfour Best price for storage and features 
len ratingfour New ability to select and move multiple items is great 
len ratingfour Switching between apps to be able to edit docs is annoying but everyone else is doing the same thing and has for years Like Microsoft and Apple 
len ratingfour I would love it if I could view my google docs within the app and then open them in the other apps when I wanted to edit That would make this stars to me 
len ratingfive The Google Drive App is a wonderful way to keep all of your files organized and easy to find 
len ratingfive It keeps them stored and never looses anything 
len ratingfive Great App awesome organizing skills what more do you need in a perfect office ready app 
len ratingone  Installed the app and went out looks like the apo was running a background sync caused to loose my gb data in the plan 
len ratingone My drive has few docs and pdfs not sure how it caused to loose my gb data 
len ratingone The app itself occupies gb of space in my storage 
len ratingone Gonna delete this app 
len ratingone I would rather access it from browser 
len ratingfive I m a musician and this is my favorite app for sharing my covers songs with my friends 
len ratingfive I simply upload my song to Google Drive from my computer and then I get a shareable link and send it to all my friends via Snapchat or iMessage 
len ratingfive It s super fast and easy to keep track of 
len ratingfive  Good stuff
len ratingone In its current stage the app is pretty clunky which is surprising coming from Google 
len ratingone There is virtually zero video support 
len ratingone Almost any large enough file you try and save to your phone will get stuck in Preparing to Export with no meter of any kind to gauge download progress 
len ratingone Needs a ton of work 
len ratingone  Terrible app 
len ratingone Can t even open wav files even when connected to wifi 
len ratingfive I use it to share photos with contractors and to access photos from different devices 
len ratingfive Very fast and useful 
len ratingone  It has allot of bugs and it exist out for no reason 
len ratingfive  Fast easy to use 
len ratingone  Unreliable
len ratingfive  Very functional fluid and user friendly 
len ratingfive This has made transferring files so much easier 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingtwo  It basically does what I want store files but I used to be able to access the website without having to download the app and now for some reason the I can t find the website 
len ratingtwo Google please stop forcing me to download your apps 
len ratingtwo I prefer the website 
len ratingfive It s beautiful and great for keeping anything safe 
len ratingfive Offers more space than Dropbox 
len ratingfive If my iPhone can automatically sync pictures with it everything would be perfect 
len ratingone  My phone freezes and app crashes all of sudden and uploads wont work
len ratingfive  Loading 
len ratingfive  excellent
len ratingfive Very good 
len ratingfive Better on Droid 
len ratingfive More options
len ratingfour  The File Upload Function appears to be having issues with hanging on certain types of PDFs and the like and sometimes I have to tell my web browser to Copy to Drive a second time before the Save to Google Drive dialog box finally appears correctly too 
len ratingfour The device that has been experiencing this issue is a White GB First Generation iPad mini running iOS too 
len ratingfour  Its super helpful with my school work and saving videos for projects but when i use this for the phone and i want to download a video to my camera roll it says loading but when its done i check my camera roll and its not their 
len ratingfour Please is there any possible way I or you can fix this 
len ratingfour I would be SUPER thankful if this could be fixed 
len ratingfour Thank you for reading my review 
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive Powerful tool 
len ratingfive I use drive for work education church and home business 
len ratingfive I appreciate the ongoing commitment with new functionality coming regularly 
len ratingtwo  Keeps crashing while trying to upload photos 
len ratingtwo Maybe don t use this app without first downloading an app that gives you the patience of a saint 
len ratingone I can upload photos to Drive from my camera roll but not open the photos in Drive once they re uploaded 
len ratingone  Something went wrong Try again later 
len ratingone I deleted the app and re downloaded it and that didn t work 
len ratingone I try to open newly uploaded photos is Drive and get the scrolling wheel of death 
len ratingone No preview photos themselves won t open nothing 
len ratingone Back to emailing photos to myself I go 
len ratingfive Google Drive is easy to use it keeps documents well organized and easy to manage
len ratingfive  It s super good
len ratingone  Worthless doesn t do anything it says ever 
len ratingone Don t waste your time
len ratingfive  Nice
len ratingthree  I ve always had problems with exporting videos into my camera roll 
len ratingthree I see on google forums that many people have the same problem as I do 
len ratingthree The save video option on ios gets stuck on preparing to export and then nothing happens 
len ratingthree Overall the sync is nice and I can open files fine 
len ratingthree Videos are not very supported though 
len ratingthree I can t open most videos in my drive because it s not available offline even though I m on wifi and I definitely can t download or save them 
len ratingfive Great and easy to use
len ratingone  This used to be my go to app for photo backups because it used to keep the photo quality and resolution intact without downgrading the resolution much to my disappointment the photo quality is fine when uploading to the drive but now downgraded when you download from Google drive back to the iPhone 
len ratingone This didn t happen before and it s very disappointing 
len ratingone Seems like the new Google drive app developers are riding in training wheels 
len ratingone I won t be using this app until this is fixed 
len ratingone So disappointed with this app lately 
len ratingone  I can t seem to download for offline any files larger than M 
len ratingone This includes PDF Files I want for offline viewing specifically RPG game books from Drivethroughrpg com 
len ratingone Dropbox can handle this just fine why not google drive 
len ratingone  I have GB in my phone and iPad and I thought they were save but not 
len ratingone After a few months I open the app and all my pictures where gone 
len ratingone I lost vital information for my profession 
len ratingone So disappointed
len ratingfive  Since drive and gsuite exist it help me work much more efficient and effectively 
len ratingfive  When one app can seamlessly save your data across all devices easily and simply 
len ratingfive That makes an awesome app 
len ratingfive All my precious photos and videos are saved for the future 
len ratingfive Good job Google 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive  Great service for free but for how long 
len ratingfive  We use google docs for work 
len ratingfive It s nice to be able to share large files with multiple users very quickly and easily 
len ratingfive I also use the drive for photo storage and sharing with family 
len ratingone  Apparently to create new various Google documents and such you need separate apps 
len ratingone  I wanted to make slides and docs but now I have to fill up more space with new apps
len ratingone used to use this app to transfer photos from computer to phone never again 
len ratingone photo quality is garbage now 
len ratingone guess it s back to dropbox 
len ratingfive  I run my entire social media agency using google drive for iPhone 
len ratingone I can t view any photos after uploading and it says something went wrong 
len ratingone Never had this issue before
len ratingthree Everything is fine until it says Something went wrong try again later 
len ratingthree My wi fi is perfectly fine and these music files I happen to have are not corrupted so I really don t understand what the problem is 
len ratingthree Just fix this issue please because I m ready to start pulling hair out of my head that I don t even have 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingfive  Google needs me to sign in to use this service Really 
len ratingthree  but when you make a file available offline it doesn t save the preview thumbnail offline so it is hard to find what you are looking for some times
len ratingone  I love Google Drive but since the last update the app crashes every time I go to load it without fail 
len ratingone Hoping for a fix update soon 
len ratingfive  I have no words 
len ratingfive  Thats how good this app is 
len ratingthree  I like it a lot but if you have music you cant make a playlist and that s one big downside to this app besides that its a great app 
len ratingthree  At one time you couldn t empty the trash with the Drive app 
len ratingthree They finally added that feature and then the latest update s removed it again 
len ratingthree What the hell Google 
len ratingthree In general the app has been getting worse with each update and they keep adding useless features 
len ratingthree Quick Access is a complete waste of space and I usually find myself disabling it it d be much better if I could set what showed up there 
len ratingthree And photos now take a lot longer to load and sometimes don t load at all 
len ratingthree Bottom line whoever designed this app should be drug out into the street and shot 
len ratingthree  Would like to feature request the ability to create and delete folders on the go 
len ratingfour Easy to use for the normal people 
len ratingfive  Great app can get enough
len ratingfour  I love this app and use it a lot but my heavy usage has made me find bugs that are somewhat irritating 
len ratingfour The first one was that I was working on a poster in Google Slides that had the dimensions of an A piece of paper 
len ratingfour Opening that file on a computer worked well except for the fact that in order to zoom in you had to actually zoom out which made the functions at the top smaller but when trying to zoom in it doesn t work but when I tried opening it on my iPad it crashed my springboard and it took seconds for me to be back on my home screen 
len ratingfour My second issue which I experienced on both Google Docs and Slides Not Sheets since I don t use it really but it might be there too is that when trying to remove files from the Recent bar at the top even though these files were already deleted or the Shared With Me folder the files would not be deleted and I would have to close the app and then open it again but then even after that some files that I had deleted come back again and I have to delete them again and again 
len ratingfour I even had an issue with the Recent bar that didn t allow me to delete of the files there and I tried over times deleting them then closing the app and opening it again and the files still don t want to go away 
len ratingfour Now although the second issue is not a deal breaker for me and I can still use the app with it 
len ratingfour The first one does affect my work and even though I don t work with A sized pages a lot it would be nice to know that I can open the file from my iPad and edit it 
len ratingfour  By the way I have an iPad Pro so performance shouldn t be a problem as specs wise the AX chip is just a tad slower than the A chip 
len ratingfour Yet again I will still continue to use Google Drive Docs Slides Sheets and they are much better that the Apple alternatives 
len ratingthree  Great app never had any problems until I realized that it had been auto backing up pictures from my phone 
len ratingthree So I ve been slowly taking time to eliminate some because it seems like every time I go to delete pictures from the Google Photos section the app crashes 
len ratingthree Only seems to happen when deleting more than one at a time 
len ratingthree Individually is does not crash 
len ratingthree Very annoying 
len ratingtwo  The app freezes for a while at first and then works fine 
len ratingtwo This has been happening for a few weeks now 
len ratingtwo Hope it gets fixed 
len ratingfour I m so grateful for the Drive app on my phone bc I can easily pull up docs and sheets for quick reference 
len ratingfour Sometimes I wish I could edit them on here but at least viewing them is helpful 
len ratingthree  For lot of times the videos can t be played I wonder what was going on 
len ratingfour  I love the Google apps 
len ratingfour Especially in a classroom application 
len ratingfour I can share and edit docs sheets and more among multiple accounts and devices share them on Classroom use them as assignments One thing I would love to see from Google however is an app or a function inside an existing app other than the Chrome browser to create and edit Google Forms 
len ratingfour That would make my educator life so much easier 
len ratingfour  Easy to use can convert and save most file types wish it were easier to organize files by categories 
len ratingfive Very usefull
len ratingfive My favorite way to deliver digital photos
len ratingfive  Listening to recorded training sessions 
len ratingfive  If it is from Google is good 
len ratingfive I use it every day 
len ratingfive It works very good 
len ratingfive  Any chance you can add on option to highlight text in PDF
len ratingthree  Need a password
len ratingtwo  Every time I play a song and go to the next song the song before plays at the same time ruining the simple sensation of listening to music
len ratingfive  The previous update broke a feature I used often so I contacted Google support and they fixed it 
len ratingfive Very happy with this new version as I use Google drive daily 
len ratingfive This saves me so much time I love this app
len ratingfive  Great functionality
len ratingfive Thanks for the space to save everything free of charge 
len ratingfive G Drive 
len ratingfive Thank you google
len ratingone  This used to be my go to app for photo backups because it used to keep the photo quality and resolution intact without downgrading the resolution much to my disappointment the photo quality is now downgraded when you upload to Google Drive 
len ratingone I won t be using this app until this is fixed 
len ratingone So disappointed with this app lately 
len ratingfour I really really really wish I could select multiple files when accessing drive from another app 
len ratingfour For example when I try to attach files from drive to an email I have to attach the files one at a time because I can not select multiple files to attach simultaneously 
len ratingfour It seriously makes sending work emails so tedious because almost everything I send for work has at least documents attached 
len ratingone  Seems that portrait mode photos upload fine but live regular selfie photos cause the error Something went wrong 
len ratingone Try again later 
len ratingone I share photo of my month old daughter via drive so this is incredibly disappointing 
len ratingfour  Iphone users why cant backup phone numbers or settings what Icloud do 
len ratingfour I hope you can make he feature of back up mobiles data emails setting conversation apps contact at least 
len ratingfour Why exporting files on iphone takes very long
len ratingfive  Keep your docs conveniently at hand when no cell service or wifi 
len ratingfive  Excellent way to communicate collaborate with others 
len ratingfive Universal with OS all types 
len ratingfive Just need to format it appropriately 
len ratingfive  the easiest way to share pics with friends and download quickly 
len ratingfive use it 
len ratingfive  I ve been using drive for years now and absolutely love it 
len ratingfive I use it for all of my files I need to access anywhere and on any system 
len ratingthree  While this app is incredibly useful for keeping photos it is very slow 
len ratingthree Videos take up to minutes each to load into drive 
len ratingthree It also takes way longer than it should to retrieve photos and videos 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingfour  I use this app all the time I love how you can share documents and work in synch with colleagues students 
len ratingtwo This app is too slow 
len ratingtwo I cant belive I paid for this
len ratingone  Says I have no internet connection 
len ratingone I can use the browser and it works fine 
len ratingone I can also select make available offline and it ll work even when it says I have no internet connection 
len ratingfive Easy to view files especially good for managing files offline while traveling 
len ratingone  It is ridiculous that google won t let you edit anything on google drive without this app 
len ratingone They need to support their documents in the browser if not Safari then Chrome 
len ratingone Forcing you to download an app instead just makes me less likely to use their services and makes everything more complex and annoying especially if you are low on space 
len ratingfive  Latest app is been crashing on iPhone 
len ratingfive One of my favorite
len ratingfour Love this app 
len ratingfour But can you please make Quick Access optional 
len ratingfour  update Quick Access is optional 
len ratingfour Not sure if it was always in the settings could have been my mistake or if they added it in but thank you 
len ratingfour I m keeping the stars because I ve been having issues uploading photos since the last update 
len ratingfour I ended up losing some things because it said they uploaded but never actually did 
len ratingfour It seems to be working right now so I hope that was fixed 
len ratingfour Also uploads can be a bit slow 
len ratingfour Still a good app and one I will continue to use 
len ratingfour  An integrated option for creating a playlist from my stored music would be nice Also when a user clicks to search for a file make the default the keyboard rather than having to click in the search bar at the top to bring up the keyboard 
len ratingfour I have never searched by file type but always by keywords in the file name 
len ratingtwo  I love using Google Drive to share art and writing but recently I ve been unable to launch the app on my iPad the device I use it the most on 
len ratingtwo I click the app from my home screen and then my screen goes black for a moment before reverting to my home screen 
len ratingtwo I don t know what s causing the issue but I hope it s solved 
len ratingfive I find Google Drive immensely practical both personally and in the office helping coordinate the complex interrelated work of a large group of people but it has taken awhile to understand and implement that potential but that effort has been very worthwhile 
len ratingfour  Use it in most days 
len ratingfour Would like to be able switch accounts easily and also search based on criteria 
len ratingfive  I share it with my project team we get to maintain and view all project related documents 
len ratingfive Thank you thank you thank you 
len ratingfour  When I slide up from the bottom of my device when not in the app and click play it often will play the last song I played on top of the current song 
len ratingfour Also the skip forward or back second buttons rarely only skip that amount of time 
len ratingfour Ideally be able to seek to any part of the track 
len ratingfour Another minor thing you could fix is when I play audio within the app it stutters at the beginning 
len ratingfour This app is still the most helpful for my purposes of playing an instrumental in the background while practicing rapping and singing my songs reading them from the notes app 
len ratingfive  Works well 
len ratingone  Takes longer to upload short videos and photos than any other app I ve used 
len ratingone Seems like it used to be better 
len ratingthree Except there is no ability to empty the trash en masse
len ratingtwo  I m not for the new update 
len ratingtwo Not sure what happens but every song I played seems to start all at once when I press play from the lock menu 
len ratingtwo It would be nice to have a music play inside the app for my created albums as well 
len ratingfive  This is super useful for team organization on projects 
len ratingfive Pair this with google docs and google hangouts and you can do just about anything you need to from your phone 
len ratingfive Google never lets me down with their software designs 
len ratingone  The June update does not allow for media stored in G Drive to play via AirPlay on Apple TV 
len ratingone This problem occurred following the latest June update 
len ratingone Please provide a fix ASAP 
len ratingfive  by far 
len ratingfive Great interface and constantly improving
len ratingone I used to love google drive 
len ratingone I have used it for awhile now for my iPhone pictures 
len ratingone Here recently the app will close out by itself freeze and it stopped uploading pictures 
len ratingone It used to say upload complete 
len ratingone Now it s not saying that 
len ratingone Please fix this issue 
len ratingthree  I love Google Drive and use it for nearly all of my personal docs and sheets 
len ratingthree Only one massively annoying feature every time I move a file to a new folder I have to confirm that I REALLY want to move it there because it will be shared with others 
len ratingthree I wish so badly that in future version they allow you to disable this feature 
len ratingthree YES I m sure I want to move my files and YES I know who is involved in each folder 
len ratingthree Thanks Google 
len ratingfive  This is a wonderful app 
len ratingfive Not only is it easy to use but it downloads and uploads videos at a pretty good rate 
len ratingfive The quality of the videos is also great 
len ratingfive Lastly the amount of storage given through the app is phenomenal and way better then paying apple aka iCloud money just for storage 
len ratingfive While google offers free storage and great resolution and download rate 
len ratingthree The new update won t let me empty my whole trash 
len ratingthree It s got an A to Z icon instead of the three dots 
len ratingthree So I spend an hour emptying the trash one file at a time 
len ratingthree Bout done 
len ratingthree If they fix this I ll never update again 
len ratingone Please fix the issue where drive immediately crashes on startup 
len ratingfour I use google drive all the time to store photos used to occasionally glitch when trying to view or download photos but every since the two most recent updates it has been horrific 
len ratingfour It seems to take forever to load files 
len ratingfour After suffering for a few weeks I decided to delete the app and reinstall seems to have done the trick speed is better than ever 
len ratingfour We will see if it holds or if it my imagination 
len ratingfive  Thanks to Googledrive I can do all the things with my iPhone that I couldn t do otherwise 
len ratingtwo  ever since the new update i m unable to save photos in their full resolution 
len ratingfive I read all the reviews saying they can t open the app without crashing 
len ratingfive I just got this app for the first time and it opened fine I tested it a few times too so hopefully the bug with the new update is fixed I haven t used the app yet but as far as the app running and opening properly it seems to be working
len ratingthree  Google continues to improve this app 
len ratingthree It along with Sheets and Docs I get a lot of use out of the whole suite 
len ratingthree One SUGGESTION PLEASE ADD the ability to scan a document directly into Drive 
len ratingthree The feature is available on Android but not on iOS 
len ratingthree Dropbox does this as well so I don t see it being a limitation of iOS 
len ratingthree This single feature will allow me to remove another app from my phone that I use for scanning 
len ratingthree Since Google made all PDF s searchable I ve been able to eliminate Evernote from my repertoire as well 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is a life saver 
len ratingfive Comes with gb can t beat that 
len ratingfive What would I do without my Drive 
len ratingone  Uploading anything takes forever 
len ratingone A simple web search for this will show many support threads with Google about this and they just won t fix it 
len ratingtwo  I loved this app until the newest update 
len ratingtwo The app won t open at all 
len ratingtwo Please help 
len ratingtwo I use it everyday and now I can t use it 
len ratingone Upgrade to the latest google drive today 
len ratingone The upgrade did not fix 
len ratingone The app opens and then minimizes 
len ratingone Unable to access files 
len ratingone iPhone IOS latest
len ratingone  doesn t work 
len ratingone won t even open
len ratingfour  Great for teachers on the go 
len ratingfive  Update Google finally fixed the issue from my previous review and I m very thankful I can use it for my backups again 
len ratingfive Without the previous issue this app is great 
len ratingfive Previous review Very dissatisfied with the last updates Google Drive used to be my go to to app for backing up all my iPhone photos 
len ratingfive Sadly I noticed with the new update there are some major flaws that didn t used to be there 
len ratingfive First I like using iPhone s built in photo editing features 
len ratingfive I use them all the time because they are versatile and they allow edits to be made to a photo without downgrading the file size resolution 
len ratingfive However I noticed after the latest Google Drive update that if I upload an edited photo say I made it black and white Google drive will upload it in its original form without the edits 
len ratingfive This is a HUGE inconvenience for me 
len ratingfive Second it used to be the case that if I upload new photos to drive it would maintain the title of the file as it appears on my iPhone 
len ratingfive So before I could just upload photos any time and they would be alphabetized correctly and chronologically 
len ratingfive Now it uploads all iPhone photos with random titles most of them titles Full Size Render 
len ratingfive What this means if you try to upload new photos into a drive folder with pre existing photos you will manually have to rename any new uploads if you want your photos to be correctly alphabetized 
len ratingfive This is time consuming and inconvenient 
len ratingfive I never had these issues before 
len ratingfour  When playing audio files sometimes it will overlap and play audio files at the same time 
len ratingfive  Google Drive allows storing all your files on the cloud that is accessible via mobile and all Google connected devices 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingthree  I love this app and have been using for a good while 
len ratingthree I think the ability to add files directly from drive into gmail rather than attaching a link should be added within the phone app 
len ratingthree I don t want to share a file most of the time just send it to someone who needs it 
len ratingthree Wish it can go on chromecast
len ratingone  Every time I open the app it freezes restricting me from navigating the app
len ratingone  Currently Google Drive crashes whenever I try to open it 
len ratingone It is normally an excellent app but I have dropped my rating based on the current issue 
len ratingfive  Very easy to use and amazing access to all kinds of files and documents with unlimited free storage 
len ratingfive Such a gift 
len ratingfive  Thanks
len ratingfive Awesome love the app
len ratingone  App constantly crashes when I open it 
len ratingone Had to reinstall it 
len ratingone Now it s not even downloading 
len ratingthree  When I search for something I want to search by file name not by file type 
len ratingthree I ll go online if I need to search because of that 
len ratingone  Latest update causes it to crash we opening the app 
len ratingfour  Good enough for backing up my iPhone album 
len ratingfour But not convenient for storing videos 
len ratingtwo  I can t open the app since the last update 
len ratingtwo I tap the app s icon but nothing happens 
len ratingtwo Just it turns grey and doesn t open 
len ratingtwo I used to love this app but how could I like this if I can t use it 
len ratingtwo You better fix it soon Google
len ratingtwo Don t know why but there s no longer a way to simultaneously empty the trash at once 
len ratingtwo  Every time there is an update the app doesn t work 
len ratingtwo I have been unable to open it since the last update which was almost a week ago 
len ratingone please fix bug causing app to crash
len ratingfour Okay so Google Drive is my go to app for storing the Friendship Makes Magic vid collab unedited footage when filming from iPad 
len ratingfour But when I go to do other stuff on my iPad it stops uploading 
len ratingfour So basically I can t put videos and such on without it being open of the time 
len ratingfour Which drains battery gets boring 
len ratingfour Plus storing the footage on drive is my way of keeping important stuff 
len ratingfour It s hard to use the app and star it when this kind of stuff gets in the way 
len ratingfour  Submitting files to Drive via the share is is excellent of course however it always has an upload failure when a new Drive folder is created during the uploading process 
len ratingfour There are absolutely no keyboard shortcuts 
len ratingfour Adding keyboard shortcuts would greatly enhance navigation throughout the application 
len ratingfour Would be incredible if Drive supported iOS s Markup extension for PDFs 
len ratingfour  Select multiple and FINALLY the ability to not only create a copy but also share PDF versions from the rest of the Google Docs suite has made Drive and its companion apps a critical component of moving to an iOS centric workflow 
len ratingone this app doesn t function at all don t get it
len ratingone Since the last update Google Drive can t open the app on my phone 
len ratingone The service is awesome but with this flaw it s impossible to use the service 
len ratingtwo  I used to use this app all the time to listen to my music but there was an update that made it so that you have to stay in the app to listen to audio files and ando you can t turn your phone off and listen so it drains my battery faster sorry that the title was a little melodramatic but this really disappoints me
len ratingone  Not that Im a big fan of google trying to upload every picture I ever take 
len ratingone I actually hate that 
len ratingone But I did upload a few to share via google plus etc 
len ratingone When I visit the google drive website these photos are quickly and clearly visible 
len ratingone On this app however all I get is a bunch of empty squares 
len ratingone No file name date preview icon or anything 
len ratingone Selecting an empty frame gives me a cryptic file name and then attempting to open in or simply view the picture results in the app freezing up and doing nothing for long periods of time 
len ratingone The desktop website portal is faster and better unless you want to give google the ability to inspect every photo you ever take and be able to use the camera in your device anytime they feel like it 
len ratingone As soon as the app is installed it sets the setting to upload every picture on the device to ON by default 
len ratingone The resulting upload steals data from my plan steals private photos and jamms the cellular data link so I cannot do anything about it except pull the plug airplane mode then search for and cut off the auto upload function s 
len ratingtwo  I only want this app to take videos people have shared with me and save the video to my iPhone but it just sits there every time I try and download one 
len ratingfive  Seriously changed my life 
len ratingfive I can do so much with Drive 
len ratingfive LOVE IT 
len ratingone  Very dissatisfied with the last updates Google Drive used to be my go to to app for backing up all my iPhone photos 
len ratingone Sadly I noticed with the new update there are some major flaws that didn t used to be there 
len ratingone First I like using iPhone s built in photo editing features

len ratingone What this means if you try to upload new photos into a drive folder with pre existing photos you will manually have to rename any new uploads if you want your photos to be correctly alphabetized 
len ratingone This is time consuming and inconvenient 
len ratingone I never had these issues before 
len ratingfour  I have used google drive for years and LOVE the app 
len ratingfour However after the recent update the app keeps crashing 
len ratingfour I ve had to install and re install multiple times but it still crashes 
len ratingfour PLEASE fix this 
len ratingone  There are many many things wrong with this app however the worst thing is lack of cleaning the cache 
len ratingone I downloaded to save memory but every picture upload stays in the app s cache the app ballooned to gigs 
len ratingone I need to delete and reinstall the app every use 
len ratingone Completely unacceptable and the program manager should be ashamed 
len ratingone  Great app except when an update renders it unusable like the latest one did 
len ratingone  When I m off the app and my my audio files end and I press play on the control center IT PLAYS THE LAST FIVE FILES I LISTENED TO ALL AT THE SAME TIME 
len ratingfive Love this App 
len ratingfive GB of free storage 
len ratingfive Syncs instantly with all your devices 
len ratingone Apple has restrictions on saving files to their devices including iPhones 
len ratingone In order to bypass this extremely frustrating and aggravating feature I have resorted to saving my files to google Drive 
len ratingone In sharing my Resume stored on Google drive I have communicated with multiple application developers with extreme frustration that they have not been able to open the resume that I sent them from Google drive 
len ratingone It has come to my attention that Google Drive makes it extremely difficult and nearly impossible for anyone to use any resumes sent from Google drive 
len ratingone This must be the exact reasonwhy I cannot get responses to resume that I sent out 
len ratingone I am blaming my frustration of not being able to acquire employment on both Apple s refusal to allow users to store files to their iPhones and Google drives restriction on file sharing from their services 
len ratingone I refuse to allow this to continue anymore 
len ratingone Starting from my next device I will no longer be utilizing any Apple devices 
len ratingone And I will refuseto utilize to drive for any cloud service 
len ratingone This is required to continue any future relationship with the professional world 
len ratingone  It crashed when it was launching 
len ratingone  What an unreliable broken app 
len ratingone If you try to export documents it fails every single time 
len ratingone If you convert the documents to another format you better get a beer or because you will grow a full beard before it finishes 
len ratingone Also trying to open a power point is probably the best test of a person s patience I have ever seen 
len ratingone You get only blank slides 
len ratingone So if you hate yourself and haven t found a reason to end it all yet get this app 
len ratingone  I have tried countless times to perform the upgrade that was released 
len ratingone Every time I get an error that the app was unable to be downloaded 
len ratingone I have power cycled checked for a software upgrade and done many soft resets 
len ratingone Also unable to delete the app and re download 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingfive  Very good app for my pictures
len ratingfive  Comes in handy save n store important files
len ratingfour  If you do work from an iPad and have GMail this is invaluable 
len ratingfour With Google Drive you can find attachments on your iPad to send with emails which I could never do before 
len ratingfour I do wish it was a little easier to organize into folders but what is nice is that when you have sent the same attachment several times that file comes up immediately when you tap the paper clip on email 
len ratingfour This has made my life much easier 
len ratingone I have tried four times to update 
len ratingone I tried to delete app and thought if I reloaded it would allow me to update 
len ratingone I didn t do it because it will delete all my data on the drive 
len ratingfive  Very simple 
len ratingtwo Whenever I open it immediately crashes 
len ratingone Thanks for the last update now the app crashes before opening my files 
len ratingone You can t offer to take care of people s personal files and do something like that 
len ratingone Definitely do not recommend 
len ratingthree  The videos and the photos from the quick access won t delete permanently it says that it is deleted from the folder but its still showing up please fix this 
len ratingfour Now I know I would have lots of tabs in there but what if I had too much and it would say Delete some tabs But first of all Great app to search on 
len ratingfour  Much better then Safari 
len ratingfour I mean maybe sometimes it would be laggy 
len ratingone  I ve just updated the app and now it won t open 
len ratingone I tried deleting it and reinstalling but I m having the same issue 
len ratingone I did not find any information in the support articles on how to fix this problem 
len ratingone I use my drive a lot so this is very inconvenient for me 
len ratingone  Have not been able to open app after the latest update 
len ratingone It crashes every time I attempt to open 
len ratingone Prior to that update Google Drive was great for organizing and storage but it was not great at loading photos or videos 
len ratingone I would need to copy the link and then download from Chrome or Safari 
len ratingone  Drive will not launch after the new update 
len ratingone It crashes about second after opening 
len ratingone It still shows up in the recent apps list like its running but trying to select it does nothing 
len ratingone Totally useless currently 
len ratingone  Since these reviews are only version based I m giving it a star because this latest update is unusable 
len ratingone Since update when I open it closes immediately 
len ratingone Drive crashes every time I open it immediately it crashes 
len ratingone  That s all
len ratingfive  Update This has since been resolved 
len ratingfive  My audio files will hardly play now 
len ratingfive In order to listen I have to have Google Drive open with the screen turned on 
len ratingfive If it goes to sleep or I put the Drive app in the background it fades off 
len ratingfive Very disappointing for me and a large battery killer now for my phone 
len ratingfive This issue only occurred since the most recent update 
len ratingfive There s another issue I ve had for a while with audio when I could still play in background control from iPhone home screen 
len ratingfive If I was listening and put my phone to sleep after turning the screen back on if I used any of the lock screen commands Rev Play Pause For the timecode would freeze 
len ratingfive Then upon unlocking the phone iPhone s to control in app pushing any button would reference the frozen time code sometimes minutes backward 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive but I m at stars so that this is hopefully looked at for feedback 
len ratingfive Seriously though thanks for a great product 
len ratingfive Hope to continue using for all things audio included 
len ratingone  It s been almost a week and I m still not able to update the app
len ratingone  It s not working for me at the moment 
len ratingone It crashes right away when I open the app and it sends me back to my home screen 
len ratingfive  Google you fixed the issue I reported extremely quickly thank you 
len ratingfive I ve never had such a fast response to feedback
len ratingfive Todo a la mano f cil y r pido 
len ratingfour  Coupled with google pics you can have all your pictures on one device 
len ratingfour It s crazy what they can do to make different albums for you a bit creepy even 
len ratingfive  Best thing happened to internet till date 
len ratingthree  Great tool
len ratingfive  It is the best of its kind 
len ratingfour This app is pretty great but first of all After I updated it would crash about a half second after startup 
len ratingfour It won t load and until this fixes i m going back to Dropbox 
len ratingfour Other than that I ve been using Drive to store music to listen to in the car for a few years 
len ratingfour I don t have a data plan and this was the most consistent app i ve found for offline storage 
len ratingfour  Great app
len ratingone  I recently uploaded a lot of irreplaceable photos and NONE OF THEM ARE IN MY DRIVE 
len ratingone It literally deleted all my recently uploaded photos and videos 
len ratingone And now it won t even let me upload ANYTHING 
len ratingone I m done with this POS I d rather use Facebook for photo storage than this smfh
len ratingfive  I play a lot of audio Books from this app and love it for that one capability 
len ratingfive I used to be able to either play the audio file book in the background app refresh or when my phone would sleep 
len ratingfive The previous update seemed to have created an issue with these two functions features 
len ratingfive I am GLAD TONSAY THIS VERSION HAS FIXED THAT 
len ratingfive Back to listening to audio via this app SEEMLESSLY 
len ratingfive  I don t know what I would do without google drive 
len ratingfive I can access from all locations from all my devices 
len ratingfive Folders for sorting and organization 
len ratingfive Cloud drive si the only way to go 
len ratingfive I really enjoy being able to access my uploads from all my computers iPads iPhones and even work computer 
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingone  IPhone instant crash on startup 
len ratingone Hopefully fixed soon 
len ratingfive  Recently I was disappointed by the update that made listening to music harder but I am glad that issue has been fixed with the new lasted update 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive So far best Personal Storage Network available 
len ratingfive  Very useful app 
len ratingfive Pretty well done 
len ratingone Every time I try to open this app it doesn t let me it s quite annoying 
len ratingone I already did an update on the app
len ratingfive I downloaded this app on my I phone to help me with my resume for apply online 
len ratingfive Never had any problems and it works wonders Highly recommend 
len ratingfive  One of the ones always in my bag 
len ratingfive Never know when I ll need it yet it s always there when I do
len ratingfive  Easy to set up and use 
len ratingfive Never had a problem with it syncing across a number of different devices 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone  What a terrible app 
len ratingone I look at my s of I images by file name 
len ratingone No tile view 
len ratingone Are you kidding google 
len ratingone O and it gets worse you can t scroll through your photos you can only view one at a time 
len ratingone And when you re done viewing the app brings you back to the home page out of the folder you just opened 
len ratingone Awful 
len ratingone Dear God how I hate this app I only use Google drive on my desktop because the App makes me so irritated 
len ratingfive  The previous update broke a feature I was often so I contacted Google support and they fixed it 
len ratingfive Very happy with this new version as I use Google drive daily 
len ratingfive I love Google Drive it s a quick easy way to share everything with everyone
len ratingfive the best 
len ratingfive loads fast i can view fine all my files including photos 
len ratingfive People learn how to use technology 
len ratingfour  Wonderful app
len ratingfive  Couldn t ask for more from a cloud storage provider 
len ratingthree  I ve been using this app for a while and never had an issues since update every time I open the app it crashes 
len ratingthree Haven t been able to use it since yesterday 
len ratingfive  Great job google drive
len ratingfive Google Drive has been a wonderful app for me to store my files especially music MP files 
len ratingfive It s a great place to be able to organize songs by band names genres and subgenres 
len ratingfive I loved that I could download my songs offline and listen to them in the car or wherever I went without waiting for the file to load 
len ratingfive I have enjoyed using it and have many songs there to listen to 
len ratingfive However when I went on the app today June th I discovered a new update overnight 
len ratingfive I was excited and hoped that there d be something of interest 
len ratingfive Instead I found that whenever I close the app or my device goes to sleep after inactivity the song stops and I have to keep google drive up on my screen to continue listening 
len ratingfive This is infuriating to me 
len ratingfive Now when I m just doing things while listening to songs I have to keep the app open and my device awake at all times which is completely pointless 
len ratingfive This will cause my battery to run down faster and I can no longer do anything while listening to music 
len ratingfive I listen to music over hours a day and am often doing other things while listening especially during school 
len ratingfive Now with this app I won t be able to listen to music while doing schoolwork since I can t leave the app and have the music continue 
len ratingfive I am very disappointed that google has changed this and would greatly appreciate if it were updated back to where videos can continue playing in the background 
len ratingfive I will give stars if this is changed as I have loved this app but since now it s going to be quite difficult to listen to my music ever I have to give it star 
len ratingfive I will continue to deal with the app at this time as it will take hundreds of hours for me to get all my songs again in a different place but you have just made a pointless decision to make videos unable to play in the device background 
len ratingfive This is all I wanted to say 
len ratingfive Please change this 
len ratingfive I can t say I d recommend this to anyone since I just have wasted hundreds of hours on getting music files on an app that at the decision of the company has just made it a pain to even bother with 
len ratingfive Put your music somewhere else if you re considering this app unless google changes this 
len ratingfive With the state the Google Drive is in now with this change I ll have to tell everyone I ve recommended this app to to not bother with it 
len ratingfive EDIT I see google has fixed this change with their latest update 
len ratingfive Very happy with this 
len ratingfive Will give the app stars again as it is a great app to use to place MP files 
len ratingfive Since I struggle with a back disability I do a lot of work using my iPhone 
len ratingfive Drive has made using already created documents so easy 
len ratingfive As a matter of fact in the last couple of years it has made creating editing sharing easy as well 
len ratingfive Great easy awesome user friendly application 
len ratingfive  stars 
len ratingone  Never loads anything for me 
len ratingone If it does it takes forever and I pay for The extra storage 
len ratingone Dropbox is more worth your money
len ratingone Recent update when open the apps suddenly crash but it shows in the background double click homebutton for iphone 
len ratingone After select the background window still crash 
len ratingone Can t play music on lockscreen or when outside of the app 
len ratingone Please add this feature back 
len ratingfive  Love it very useful to review all your saved docs through the app when you need it quick 
len ratingone When I press my videos it won t play or preview 
len ratingone Takes for ever to view a PDF Book
len ratingfive  I don t see how it gets any easier 
len ratingfive Original post Music files aren t playing in background real trash Edit They have since corrected this issue real happy it s a star app again 
len ratingone  I usually love the app 
len ratingone But since it last updated it won t open on my iPhone 
len ratingone Please fix it
len ratingfive  Google Drive has changed the way we do business 
len ratingfive Thank You Google 
len ratingfive  Absolute life saver on several occasions 
len ratingfive Home run 
len ratingfive Best app ever 
len ratingtwo For some reason google drive has me waiting and waiting for items to pop up to be uploaded to a folder 
len ratingtwo I have closed my app on my iPhone even restarted and nothing 
len ratingtwo Any ideas why this is happening
len ratingfive Can not imagine how I am going live without google drive
len ratingone  The app as of June th is constantly crashing 
len ratingone It is still crashing even after the update 
len ratingone  So much time wasted 
len ratingone It takes forever to be able to view photos 
len ratingone At one time you had to make available offline individually in order to view a photo 
len ratingone Then you could select all to make available offline 
len ratingone But they are not 
len ratingone You have to remove offline availability then make available offline takes forever 
len ratingone But there is a solution to this 
len ratingone You must individually hit option to view 
len ratingone It s ridiculously time consuming Now I cannot view any files that were made available offline Either way I don t understand why a photo that I took would require online availability to view a photo taken from my phone 
len ratingone It will occasionally suggest no internet connection 
len ratingone It s a photo 
len ratingone There is no url 
len ratingone I m not looking to view a photo by backtracking to its original source 
len ratingone  Dumbing down the features in recent update 
len ratingone You can no longer listen to audio from the lock screen 
len ratingone Quite lame 
len ratingfour  Thank you Google 
len ratingfour  While I m a fan of the software to begin with because I use it to listen to audio files while offline but with the new update I can t do that because the file stops playing when I lock my phone or back out of the app 
len ratingfour Please fix this 
len ratingfive Google Drive has really help me out a lot 
len ratingfive The fact that I can also connect to other apps such as Google classroom really makes it a helpful tool 
len ratingfive I can upload my homework in the drive and upload it on time with Google classroom despite being late to class 
len ratingfive It s a godsend 
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone  I am absolutely sickened by Google s updates here that I would rate this zero stars if I could 
len ratingone I used to be able to play music while turning off my screen but now when I do turn off my screen the music just STOPS 
len ratingone Because of this Google just demerited their app by 
len ratingone I miss being able to play my favorite songs on the go but now I have to keep the screen open and waste a ton of phone battery 
len ratingone Plus I want to be able to upload a thumbnail background for a song just to keep for organization reasons but Google obviously didn t even bother and instead add an update that shoots themselves in the foot 
len ratingone They did this crap with Firefox as well and they are doing nothing but tarnishing their reputation 
len ratingone Please be more descriptive google in the update details so that I don t update 
len ratingone Thank you google for ruining my day 
len ratingone I loved this app and had hundreds of songs but now that s taken away
len ratingfive  Exactly what I wanted and more
len ratingtwo Google the update does not allow background audio so every time I listen to something and I close the app or close out my phone the audio stops and it is very annoying 
len ratingtwo This makes the app useless in my book now 
len ratingtwo Google please put this functionality back into the app please
len ratingone Everything is fine except the fact that you can t listen to audio files with your phone turned off or out of the app 
len ratingone I have recordings that i put into drive and i usually listen to then with my phone turned off to save my battery life 
len ratingone I also sometimes play games while listening to them 
len ratingone Now i can t do either of those two things 
len ratingone Please make it how it used to be 
len ratingfour  Please undo this and bring back continuous play 
len ratingone  The app as of June th is constantly crashing 
len ratingfive By far the best of its kind 
len ratingfive Easy to maneuver and has easy access for just about everywhere by whoever you want to have access to it 
len ratingfive If you have a google account there is no need not to have this app 
len ratingone  This is bull sh it it just stopped working it will open then shut down fix this now 
len ratingone Not in a couple days now 
len ratingfive  Where is it 
len ratingfive Working good so far just learning to use the drive 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Hangs for seconds on startup before u can even scroll through ur photos 
len ratingone I used this to take pics of packages and receipts for online selling I do 
len ratingone Now this piece of garbage makes me wait 
len ratingone This is UNACCEPTABLE 
len ratingone TEST BEFORE U RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC 
len ratingone Fix this NOW 
len ratingfive I love google drive as I can store many pictures in different files with yearly plan which is reasonable not very expensive and also when I want to switch pictures or video clips I can do it Thanks to google i don t like drop 
len ratingfive Box as they charge monthly while google charges yearly which is more convenient for big storage plan thanks
len ratingone  it used to be good but now mo files I am playing no longer play in the background 
len ratingone The music stops playing as soon as you leave Google Drive screen 
len ratingone It happens only under my account but when I log in from my wife s account everything is still good 
len ratingone I have also noticed that the icon of Google Drive MP player turns blue under my account but still stays Gray for my wife s account 
len ratingone This is a nasty bug for me 
len ratingone Same behavior happens on all iOS devices doesn t matter which device I m using 
len ratingone  I can t play uploaded videos anymore 
len ratingone  Now google drive shuts down when my phone goes to sleep 
len ratingone I use this to listen to audio on and all the time and it s seriously annoying to have to keep waking the phone up to be able to listen without interruption 
len ratingone I really hope they fix this soon 
len ratingone  The app used to play audio in the background now it cannot perform this simple task 
len ratingone I am extremely disappointed 
len ratingone I d be even more sad to see Google lose good customers like me for an issue as simple as this 
len ratingone Please fix this issue 
len ratingone I used to love using this a a music app when I m on the go or something and with the removed background audio it s hard to find lyrics to sing to or even have fun on my phone while listening to music
len ratingfive  Good service
len ratingone  Extremely disappointed you no longer can play audio in the background or locked phone 
len ratingone The latest update disabled that please bring it back 
len ratingfive  Makes all other cloud based file sharing systems obsolete 
len ratingfive Period
len ratingone after upgrade google drive I can t use my google drive s video that is bug please fix it
len ratingone The only way to look at files offline is to manually change each one 
len ratingtwo  It no longer runs my music in the background and the main reason I have it is as a platform to listen to me original songs before I put them out to the world and it s hard to accurately critique if it cuts out anytime I get a text I need to answer on my phone goes into sleep mode 
len ratingone You made it so audio files can t be played from the lock screen anymore 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone Why is that necessary 
len ratingfive  Love it when I want I can listen to music that I make myself and I can always access sheets 
len ratingfour  If I save a PDF file via IOS on to my Google Drive then make changes on that particular PDF file delete the original PDF and I upload the new file with the same exact name the previous version of the file will open the one that I deleted 
len ratingfour Please fix this problem I would imagine others have this same issue 
len ratingfour Best Regards Adam Oganyan
len ratingone I Love Google drive but this change has made me did like google drive I may also remove it from my phone because it is no use to me anymore with out this feature
len ratingone  Audio files used to play in the background or when the screen was locked 
len ratingone Now the audio pauses every time the screen locks or you exit the app 
len ratingfive  Best app for photo and video back up from iPhone absolutely love this app 
len ratingfour I ve been a heavy drive user for years 
len ratingfour I don t use the phone app very often but when I do I appreciate it s simplicity and reliability 
len ratingfour I really like Google Drive mobile app 
len ratingfour It allows me to get a lot done in the road without too much effort 
len ratingfour I would like to see better handling of PDFs including in file searches 
len ratingfour  Before the recent update I was able to listen to audio files on google drive while using other apps 
len ratingfour As of recently whenever my phone auto locks or I open another app that feature isn t available anymore and I really miss it 
len ratingfour Please bring it back 
len ratingone  So first GMail and now Drive 
len ratingone Both used to support the feature of being able to listen to audio while outside the application 
len ratingone GMail ended that over a year ago and I guess now it s Drives turn 
len ratingone Done using both 
len ratingone Thanks for screwing up two great apps 
len ratingfive  Perfect App 
len ratingone  I used Google Drive to import audio files I was working on for the purpose of checking mixes before I upload them to Apple Music for everyone else to hear 
len ratingone Now the app won t play in the background AND the vibrate button HAS to be off for the music to even be heard 
len ratingone Now I have to see about Dropbox instead 
len ratingone Latest update immediately crashes after logging into account from iPhone 
len ratingone Should consider releasing fewer updates but with more quality testing prior to release 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingtwo  I use google drive for so many different reasons and ended up buying more space just because of how useful it is 
len ratingtwo However with the recent update they removed the ability to listen to audio files while your iOS device is closed locked 
len ratingtwo This was one of the main things I used the app for I am not sure why it was removed 
len ratingtwo Please add this back google 
len ratingtwo This feature is make or break for me and I love the app in everything but this 
len ratingone Please fix the audio 
len ratingone The audio only works if you re in the app 
len ratingone You can t even lock your phone without it being stopped 
len ratingone Please fix soon 
len ratingtwo  While I do very much enjoy the prices for the amount of storage you get and the fact that Drive jumped on the video picture on picture bandwagon I am not at all enjoying two aspects of the app I used to be able to play any video any time on my Apple devices iPhone s and iPad Air without having to make it available offline and clogging up my storage space 
len ratingtwo I do not have this problem on my computer but why make this a thing 
len ratingtwo  I m not loving that audio files can t be played in the background while I m doing something else 
len ratingtwo Yes picture on picture does rectify this somewhat but being able to have it in the background would help immensely 
len ratingone  Google Drive has been a wonderful app for me to store my files especially music MP files 
len ratingone It s a great place to be able to organize songs by band names genres and subgenres 
len ratingone I loved that I could download my songs offline and listen to them in the car or wherever I went without waiting for the file to load 
len ratingone I have enjoyed using it and have many songs there to listen to 
len ratingone However when I went on the app today June th I discovered a new update overnight 
len ratingone I was excited and hoped that there d be something of interest 
len ratingone Instead I found that whenever I close the app or my device goes to sleep after inactivity the song stops and I have to keep google drive up on my screen to continue listening 
len ratingone This is infuriating to me 
len ratingone Now when I m just doing things while listening to songs I have to keep the app open and my device awake at all times which is completely pointless 
len ratingone This will cause my battery to run down faster and I can no longer do anything while listening to music 
len ratingone I listen to music over hours a day and am often doing other things while listening especially during school 
len ratingone Now with this app I won t be able to listen to music while doing schoolwork since I can t leave the app and have the music continue 
len ratingone I am very disappointed that google has changed this and would greatly appreciate if it were updated back to where videos can continue playing in the background 
len ratingone I will give stars if this is changed as I have loved this app but since now it s going to be quite difficult to listen to my music ever I have to give it star 
len ratingone I will continue to deal with the app at this time as it will take hundreds of hours for me to get all my songs again in a different place but you have just made a pointless decision to make videos unable to play in the device background 
len ratingone This is all I wanted to say 
len ratingone Please change this 
len ratingone I can t say I d recommend this to anyone since I just have wasted hundreds of hours on getting music files on an app that at the decision of the company has just made it a pain to even bother with 
len ratingone Put your music somewhere else if you re considering this app unless google changes this 
len ratingone With the state the Google Drive is in now with this change I ll have to tell everyone I ve recommended this app to to not bother with it 
len ratingfive  Better than that
len ratingone You have to have the screen on and open to listen to personal music 
len ratingone This wastes battery is useless 
len ratingfive  Amazing 
len ratingthree  Great
len ratingone  When i upload photos the app automatically makes all edited photos back to stock and names them full size render 
len ratingtwo  Music files aren t playing in background real trash
len ratingone  It used to work well I could check all my audio work on it while using other apps 
len ratingone Now it ll only work when the app open so I can t listen to music on it unless the screen is open it won t play music offline 
len ratingone Basically it s become crazy buggy 
len ratingone I m gonna switch over to Dropbox as their app although more annoying to get files on is more stable and works as advertised 
len ratingone Bummer 
len ratingtwo  My band passes our current tracks to each other on the drive 
len ratingtwo I use to be able to play the songs like a standard media player but now I can t use it unless I use it like I m watching YouTube 
len ratingtwo This app is definitely getting replaced with something I can access my files easier with
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive The new update will not allow me to play my audio files when I leave the app please fix that in the next update thank you 
len ratingfive  Not sure what happened with this recent update but I can no longer listen to my music while the app is minimized or my phone is locked 
len ratingfive  And music will not play from the phone speaker only earbuds 
len ratingfive Please don t make me find another app 
len ratingfive I m lazy 
len ratingone  Songs audio files don t play in the background anymore which is of what I used the app for 
len ratingone  I can t play music files unless in the app rendering this app useless for my purposes I need to be able to play instrumental tracks in the background while rapping lyrics from the notes app 
len ratingone Please add that feature back google 
len ratingone Don t be greedy 
len ratingtwo  Google Drive has been a wonderful app for me to store my files especially music MP files 
len ratingtwo It s a great place to be able to organize songs by band names genres and subgenres

len ratingtwo This is all I wanted to say 
len ratingtwo Please change this 
len ratingone  I m now unable to listen to any of my uploaded audio at least through the speaker when its on silent 
len ratingone Even then I m not allowed to play audio in the background anymore or when my phone is locked 
len ratingone None of this was ever an issue before 
len ratingone One of main reasons I used Drive was to listen to music and now that it doesn t work properly I am considering switching to Dropbox 
len ratingfive  Love the mobility and flexibility of Google Drive 
len ratingfive From my phone my tablet my laptop all my files in one place 
len ratingfive The ability to create files on the fly is so handy when I want to track something in a spreadsheet or save a longer note 
len ratingfive Sharing is a great feature no more emailing attachments back and forth 
len ratingthree  Dear developers Please please bring back functionality that allows audio listening in background 
len ratingthree I use Drive exclusively to listen to teleseminars and online courses in which I m enrolled 
len ratingthree I even pay for extra Drive storage and now I have no way of listening and taking notes at the same time 
len ratingthree This update has severely impacted my course learning during my daily commute 
len ratingthree Please remedy this I m begging you 
len ratingfive  It s so handy to use when you re on a smartphone or tablet
len ratingone  I use to be able to go to a different app while playing music now I can t 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingone I used to use this for music 
len ratingone I used to be able to listen to my music and go on other apps or turn off my iPhone and still listen to the music 
len ratingone Now it pauses the music when I turn my phone off which is all I used google drive for 
len ratingone I really don t like the new update 
len ratingone  I m here to say what we ve all been thinking 
len ratingone Where 
len ratingone Is 
len ratingone Our 
len ratingone Background 
len ratingone Play 
len ratingone Before this update I could listen to the audio files in my drive without being in the app and now that has changed I On a scale of to of rage I m on a 
len ratingone  I used to love this app 
len ratingone But it is no longer useable 
len ratingone It says I have to set my password 
len ratingone Have done that over and over 
len ratingone But it still won t let me in 
len ratingone And yes I am typing it correctly 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone It s been unable to play any kind of video or any media that has video in it it just doesn t work any more
len ratingfive  I really forgot since when I have been using Google Photos 
len ratingfive It s a life sever App 
len ratingfive Using this app not only in Android I am very much comfortable with iOS as well 
len ratingone  I now cannot play any audio without headphones in my phone 
len ratingone This isn t a problem with my phone because I don t have this problem with any other app 
len ratingone Also the audio stops playing when I leave the app which never used to happen 
len ratingfive I have been using it for years 
len ratingfive I can use Google Drive on my desk top iPad and my phone 
len ratingfive I like the convenes of working on documents anywhere 
len ratingtwo  My audio files will hardly play now 
len ratingtwo In order to listen I have to have Google Drive open with the screen turned on 
len ratingtwo If it goes to sleep or I put the Drive app in the background it fades off 
len ratingtwo Very disappointing for me and a large battery killer now for my phone 
len ratingtwo This issue only occurred since the most recent update 
len ratingtwo There s another issue I ve had for a while with audio when I could still play in background control from iPhone home screen 
len ratingtwo If I was listening and put my phone to sleep after turning the screen back on if I used any of the lock screen commands Rev Play Pause For the timecode would freeze 
len ratingtwo Then upon unlocking the phone iPhone s to control in app pushing any button would reference the frozen time code sometimes minutes backward 
len ratingtwo I love Google Drive but I m at stars so that this is hopefully looked at for feedback 
len ratingtwo Seriously though thanks for a great product 
len ratingtwo Hope to continue using for all things audio included 
len ratingtwo please it would be so great if I could edit my files in this app without having to download the others docs slides sheets etc 
len ratingtwo thanks 
len ratingtwo Otherwise great app
len ratingfour  I like it gets the job done
len ratingfive Very handy for keeping my knitting and crochet patterns handy 
len ratingfive I also like using it to save travel documents 
len ratingfive  Love love love Google Drive 
len ratingfive All my email docs shared folders and videos and everything in one spot 
len ratingfive Plus it s user friendly 
len ratingfive Definitely recommend 
len ratingfive You can axes ur docs presentations and even more this is the best app 
len ratingone  The new update breaks an extremely important feature 
len ratingone I listen to audio files in the background and now when I close the app the audio stops playing 
len ratingone Who is beta testing these updates 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive It s almost like a dream to me 
len ratingfive Who could ever say a bad word about essentially a free office productivity platform 
len ratingfive Plus it keeps getting better with its updates 
len ratingfive It s the best online deal out there 
len ratingone  I don t like this new update 
len ratingone I use to be able to play my personal music on here and leave the app but now it cuts my music off when I leave the app 
len ratingone  My reason for getting this app was because music wouldn t play from my email when the screen locks 
len ratingone Everything was great until this new update which stops music from playing when the screen locks 
len ratingone Thinking about deleting this app now 
len ratingone  Instructions I give star Overall I give stars 
len ratingone Instructions are hard to understand 
len ratingone Too many words wordy 
len ratingone No bullet or right to point 
len ratingone It easier to read by bullets Step by Step instructions 
len ratingone At first it was frustrating but as time goes by the system does get easier 
len ratingfive  Muit ssimo bom
len ratingfive  Google Drive is a great app 
len ratingfive Reliable versatile and simple 
len ratingfive It s a vital productivity and collaboration tool for my business 
len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingone I rely on this app for a series of audio files that I listen to on multiple devices 
len ratingone With the new version audio playback cuts out when the screen locks and it also won t play if the phone is on silent meaning the playback is interrupted if I get an email or call 
len ratingone Neither of those used to be the case and it makes audio playback useless 
len ratingtwo I ve been using Google Drive to store any type of audios so that I can listen to them easily on my phone when I m out of the house but a few things have changed 
len ratingtwo  I can t listen to any audios unless I plug in headphones I have to have the app active in order to continue listening 
len ratingone Wow i cant listen to my audio files while im using other apps or when locking my phone after the recent update 
len ratingone I hope they ll fix this and make it useful for me or otherwise i wont use this app anymore 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingtwo I can no longer listen to music outside of the app this was a feature that was used everyday 
len ratingone  App wont open on my iPhone Plus 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive  I ve worked with this for school and work and it s outstanding
len ratingone  I used to have all my music on my google drive but now whenever I minimize the app it turns it off
len ratingfour  Syncing and viewing is smooth and unobtrusive 
len ratingfour I m glad I can edit a doc via my phone 
len ratingfour It s a shame it s missing keep with next since it s an online tool that tries to stick with a paper format but doesn t give control over when NOT to split text 
len ratingtwo For a while after an update it would freeze on start up then suddenly move and think I clicked on something else 
len ratingtwo I disabled the recent items and that made it worse 
len ratingtwo I had to uninstall and re install it 
len ratingtwo Now the delay is resolved and the recent thing is disabled 
len ratingtwo However I use drive to listen to specific audio files and now they will not continue to play in the background 
len ratingtwo I have no other way to listen to these and it is upsetting when an app loses functionality 
len ratingone  No this just isn t right when I open the app it lags then it takes me out back home and I keep on doing it but it just doesn t work this version that they update you guys update it again 
len ratingfive  This is very good
len ratingthree  The music no longer plays In the latest version unless it is the center of attention and your phone is awake I used to be able to listen to my music on the go now it s a battery drain 
len ratingthree I use the app for many things but most of the time I use it to listen to audio files 
len ratingthree Ever since the newest update the audio files do not continue to play in the background 
len ratingthree I have lost a great study tool 
len ratingthree Is it a setting 
len ratingone  The most recent update prevents me from listening to audio files while using other apps on the phone or when my phone is locked 
len ratingone It also keeps the sound muted when the phone is set to vibrate 
len ratingone I can no longer listen to my audiobooks while doing other things or having my phone locked and when I do the audio gets interrupted by the sound of notifications 
len ratingfour Crashes when I select photos to delete 
len ratingfour As soon as I hit delete it crashes 
len ratingfour Photos are deleted but have to log back into the app 
len ratingfour iPhone s Plus on latest IOS version 
len ratingfive  The only place a store anything anymore
len ratingone iPhones already have it hard enough to play music from artists that isn t on ITunes and you just made it a lot harder to listen to them 
len ratingone Bring back the background play 
len ratingone It used to be that I could play MP files and click my phone off not full shutdown and the file would still play but now if so much as click the home button the file stops playing 
len ratingone GOOGLE PLEASE FIX THIS
len ratingfive Great for storage and for moving information from one device to another and seamlessly allow me access to everything on all of my devices
len ratingfive  iPhone
len ratingfive  In the new update I can t listen to files while my phone is locked or if I back out of the app the files stop playing and it s really annoying cause that wasn t in any of the other updates just in this one so if u could change it back that would be greatly appreciated
len ratingone I can t watch any of my videos because it keeps saying they are being processed and to come back later 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone  It glitched out and now I can t use my google drive app at all 
len ratingone It won t open 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and reinstalled and it won t open 
len ratingone Also now I can t access App Support so I have to write this review to get it out there that this update is bad 
len ratingone  The newest update doesn t let me play songs I have saved in the drive anymore unless the app is open on the screen 
len ratingone The fact that I could play music and then turn off the phone or go to other apps while music was playing is the main reason I used drive over other players 
len ratingone Really disappointed they took this feature off 
len ratingfour I love to use the app there is just one problem 
len ratingfour I do marching band and this is how I get my music but when I practice it I can t get the arrows to go left or right to go away so I will have to stop playing and scroll down 
len ratingfour Otherwise a good app
len ratingone I used to be able to listen to MPs from this app when it was not open but now you re required to have the app open and the screen must be on for anything to play 
len ratingone This app is now virtually useless to me 
len ratingone I m extremely disappointed with this update 
len ratingfive  I have always loved the way Drive lets me have my pictures documents and videos wherever I am and to easily share them with others 
len ratingfive My school district became a Google Apps for Education district after several of us asked for it over the past years 
len ratingfive I am excited that instead of showing my students how functional and valuable this app is they can now see for themselves 
len ratingfive  Good on ipad a way to save space on ipad
len ratingfive Love it its fun to use and simple and helps me share things with others
len ratingfour  I have really liked the amount of storage space it has compared to Dropbox 
len ratingone Why does the app not keep the original file name for iPhone pics 
len ratingone Why are you limited to selecting only nine or ten files to upload at a time 
len ratingone Extremely cumbersome 
len ratingone Two thumbs down 
len ratingfive Love that I can access all my files on whatever device I m around 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive  Great app for accessing cloud storage docs 
len ratingone It says my videos are still being processed or play button is X out I didn t have this problem with the old version I reload the old version and it works fine 
len ratingone  Usually this app works great but now all of a sudden it crashes as soon as I open it 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfour  I can t say it s perfect but it is available for me for so many uses that I d truly be lost without it 
len ratingfour I use the survey docs every two weeks for a group I organize 
len ratingfour I love the ease with which I can create a spreadsheet for the results 
len ratingfour What I don t like about Google Docs is the reformatting it does when you write in there and try to copy paste it to Word 
len ratingfour You have to compensate a lot 
len ratingfour The folders are easy to use in Drive and the sharing of documents and writing simultaneously with another person is nothing less than magical to me 
len ratingfive  Literally couldn t ask for more 
len ratingfive Has never given me any problems 
len ratingfive The best cloud 
len ratingfive  Very easy to use 
len ratingfive Lots of storage at a reasonable price if you want to upgrade 
len ratingfive Worthy 
len ratingone  Why isn t this fixed with any of the last few updates 
len ratingone I rely on this for my work and school please fix soon 
len ratingfour  Why can t I order by date 
len ratingfour I have been trying to organize ALL my photos but it seems rather undaunting task
len ratingfive The app is very straightforward and intuitive 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Google has developed a lot of great features and this one is another winner 
len ratingfive Not only does it store files for you in an extremely convenient way but it also allows you to manipulate many of those files with capable software 
len ratingfive The fact that people expect it to also make them coffee I find troubling 
len ratingfive Google Drive gives me flexibility for storage of my files photos videos etc 
len ratingfive This App is easy to access and user friendly to navigate 
len ratingfive  Makes everything in life easier 
len ratingfour  Pretty handy tool to have 
len ratingfour I need to access documents and files for my everyday use this app does that 
len ratingfour I highly recommend it 
len ratingfive  You guys on Google rock 
len ratingfive I am one of the first users of the package to companies and I love it 
len ratingfive I ve been spreading the word to all my friends since then and they are very satisfied as well 
len ratingfive I totally recommend Drive and all it s tools 
len ratingfive It is always improving and getting better and better 
len ratingfive Thank you Team Google 
len ratingfive Osss

len ratingone  App currently crashes on launch 
len ratingfive  I can do all my documents on the go anywhere I am with my phone 
len ratingfive Super great

len ratingfive Good work google
len ratingfive LOVE this for my LIFE 
len ratingfive Both professionally th grade teacher staff tech instructor and personally I rely heavily on Google Drive 
len ratingfive As a frequent user I also have many tweaks I could suggest to the Google team 
len ratingfive  Google Drive app works very well if you have a google account 
len ratingfive Very useful for on the go work 
len ratingfive  Drive is what I use to access all my documents on my Android phone Windows laptop home and work and iPad 
len ratingfive I m not a heavy Drive user but I do like the accessibility it provides 
len ratingfive  I came from Android and was so happy that this was on iOS in fact all the Google apps I use from Android are flawlessly working on my iPhone plus 
len ratingfive Two thumbs up 
len ratingone  I recently updated the app and is not working in IOS 
len ratingone It hangs
len ratingfive  Been using google drive to back up the phone for a long time 
len ratingfive Never had a problem 
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingfive  My work and home life depend on access to drive 
len ratingfive This app is fantastic it gives me access to everything I need when I am on the go and always works 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this if you use drive on the desktop and or in your browser 
len ratingone All my files worked until the new update 
len ratingone Now it says all the files that have been there for many months are still being processed or just show the play button with an X through it 
len ratingone The idea is to make improvements with your releases i thought not break everything 
len ratingone Thanks for nothing with this new release 
len ratingfive  I keep most of my working docs on drive and can access the easily from any device 
len ratingfour  Great for virtual group work the mobile app is a smooth transition off the computer to on the go 
len ratingfour Very appreciative of this tool 
len ratingfive Very good app free cloud storage where i can store music and important files and use them with my phone
len ratingfour  Drive is my go to for file access across devices 
len ratingfour Fast organized easy to use and efficient 
len ratingfour If I had to name a complaint I would love it to remember where I was in a file if I leave one and come back to it later and I would particularly love to be able to skip around in PDF s to jump around pages non linearly 
len ratingfour Long files can be tedious without these features 
len ratingfive  Love backing up all of my pictures on drive 
len ratingfive It keeps my phone clean and pics easily accessible 
len ratingfive  The best app on my phone I use it everyday 
len ratingone  I hate this app kill it
len ratingfive I love Google Drive 
len ratingfive Saves all my important things and pictures 
len ratingfive It s very functional and I highly recommend it 
len ratingfour  Great tool for all docs etc
len ratingfive I use this all the time 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingtwo Long live WebM support on mobile 
len ratingfive Have access to your files anywhere 
len ratingfive What more could you ask for 
len ratingfive App is simple and easy to use
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone  One of the best apps I have but since this most recent update of the videos I use for my presentations are coming up with an error saying This video has not yet been processed I NEVER had this problem before the most recent update 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingfour The app performs excellently 
len ratingfour I only dislike one aspect of viewing videos 
len ratingfour In order to switch videos you must return to the folder and select the desired video 
len ratingfour It would be great if there were skip buttons to proceed to the next video or preview the next file in the folder and previous 
len ratingfour It would be even better if the swipe gestures would do this 
len ratingthree Great app to use for storeing videos but I have run into a few problems as of late 
len ratingthree I originally started use it this app when I had an android GS and would save videos I would download but since I have switched to the I phone plus the videos I watched on my android aren t as clear on my I phone 
len ratingthree I am not sure if it is because it is a larger screen or more pixels in the iPhone or just the app but nether the less the videos are all pixelated 
len ratingthree Second is that it takes too long to open videos in another app 
len ratingthree Third recently the app is nolonger showing a thumbnail for any video I have uploaded recently 
len ratingthree Other than that it is a great app and highly recommend it
len ratingfive  Digitizing files from iPhone and iPad great storage option for my business
len ratingthree  I am using iphone plus with my OS updated to the latest version iOS 
len ratingthree Earlier version of the app used to freeze when I opened it but recently days back I updated the app in the hopes of the bugs getting fixed 
len ratingthree But the issue still persists 
len ratingthree I timed it when I open the app it freezes for about seconds the screen is still it does not respond to the touch and then starts to function normally 
len ratingthree This happens EVERY time I open the app 
len ratingthree I am really bugged by this issue because I think seconds is a long time for an app like google drive to respond 
len ratingfive Works well cross platform 
len ratingone  Since the update your app won t open 
len ratingthree  Every time I upload an amount of photos it crashes 
len ratingthree Fix it NOW 
len ratingfive I believe it s a fantastic and very convenient 
len ratingfive Revolutionary 
len ratingthree  I ve tried everything I can think of to fix the settings so that it will upload videos and pics while not using the app 
len ratingthree Either it can t be done or mine doesn t work correctly 
len ratingthree Other than that it s a great app and I love storing my vids and pics there for easy access from anywhere
len ratingfive I use multiple computers and a phone and my documents are all easily accessible on all my devices 
len ratingfive What more do you need 
len ratingone  I ran the update yesterday and now the app won t open 
len ratingone It keeps crashing 
len ratingone So you need to go back and check your bug notes because I can t access anything from my iPad and I m in the middle of a conference where I am supposed to be presenting files I have saved to my drive 
len ratingfive  Trying to keep documents for traveling in paper was too cumbersome 
len ratingfive Goe docs allows me to have those documents available offline so I don t have to go over my international data limit just to have the confirmation documents for my trip 
len ratingtwo  gifs are sort of understandable but videos 
len ratingtwo none of the videos i ve previously uploaded or recently uploaded have loaded 
len ratingtwo and please get rid of the quick access tool it s incredibly annoying 
len ratingfive Using iPad iPhone android and windows based computers I need a universal storage service 
len ratingfive Drive has been meeting that need for me for several years now 
len ratingfive It is fairly simple after learning curve and it has proven reliable and highly mobile working well on any platform
len ratingfour I can access all my files regardless of what device in using and across multiple OS 
len ratingfour That makes my life easier since I work with Apple at home and windows elsewhere 
len ratingfour My only compassion is having to use the Google products slides docs etc to open something like a presentation because those don t have the same capabilities as PowerPoint 
len ratingfour Other than that is a great app 
len ratingtwo  Was opened too late and bad images in total speed is little compared to drop box
len ratingfive I could have a life without drive but it wouldn t be as easy 
len ratingfive Saves me stress all the time 
len ratingfive I don t write reviews but this is an exception 
len ratingfive Easy fast lots of space good for me 
len ratingfive  Makes it easier to store downloaded items in specific folders
len ratingfive Accessible from any digital device 
len ratingfive Very handy for an on the go person 
len ratingfive Works great on everything 
len ratingfive Apple Microsoft android etc 
len ratingfive Have had NO issues no downtime no issues accessing files 
len ratingfive Works GREAT 
len ratingfive  After being a dropbox user for years I had a major issue with my administration access I decided to switch to Google drive and give it a test I just regret not having done so earlier Google Drive is really great
len ratingfive  Tons of space 
len ratingfive Have your files ready at your finger tips 
len ratingfive Never forget important documents at home again 
len ratingfour  Seems to work reasonably well in the app version 
len ratingfour  Needs an iMessage app like Dropbox 
len ratingfour Live GIF playback would be great also 
len ratingfive Dope
len ratingfive  I love the fact I can save several files to this program and use them from any dispositive just with one click 
len ratingone  I thought this app would let me get away from the stupidity of backing up pictures to iCloud but it deleted most of what I downloaded and now I have barely any of my original pictures
len ratingfour  even didn t support to preview plain text file 
len ratingfour and when open a file in other app the file received will lost the file extension that cause other app can t open it too 
len ratingfour wish to fix this 
len ratingfive From phone to desktop to work computer I can seamlessly access all of my documents including ai psd and indd and share them which is beyond helpful for group collaborations 
len ratingone  Wish this app had the same scan feature like the Android version
len ratingfive  I love the clean large spaces in my google docs 
len ratingfive I love the colors and shapes I can use and the multi faceted filing system that I can share with my students and TAs 
len ratingfive  Awesome
len ratingtwo This video has not yet processed
len ratingfive Me encanta 
len ratingone  My saved avi and MP files won t play after this update 
len ratingone Get an error message saying video has not yet been processed 
len ratingone This only happens on my iPad iOS 
len ratingone The videos work on my phone
len ratingfive  I love it 
len ratingone  Google Drive used to be my go to to backup all my iPhone photos 
len ratingone Sadly I noticed with the new update there are some major flaws that didn t used to be there 
len ratingone First I like using iPhone s built in photo editing features 
len ratingone I use them all the time because they are versatile and they allow edits to be made to a photo without downgrading the file size resolution 
len ratingone However I noticed after the latest Google Drive update that if I upload an edited photo say I made it black and white Google drive will upload it in its original form without the edits 
len ratingone This is a HUGE inconvenience for me 
len ratingone Second it used to be the case that if I upload new photos to drive it would maintain the title of the file as it appears on my iPhone 
len ratingone So before I could just upload photos any time and they would be alphabetized correctly and chronologically 
len ratingone Now it uploads all iPhone photos with random titles most of them titles Full Size Render 
len ratingone What this means if you try to upload new photos into a drive folder with pre existing photos you will manually have to rename any new uploads if you want your photos to be correctly alphabetized 
len ratingone This is time consuming and inconvenient 
len ratingone I never had these issues before 
len ratingone Very disappointed with the new Drive version 
len ratingone I hope they fix this
len ratingfive  I ve written two books in Google Docs 
len ratingfive I never have to worry about not having my computer 
len ratingfive I don t have to worry about forgetting to save the document 
len ratingfive It tracks all of my editing 
len ratingfive There are so many advantages there s not enough room here to list them all 
len ratingfive I don t know what I would do without Google Drive 
len ratingfive  I absolutely love google drive 
len ratingfive Can t really think of anything they could do to improve it 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is available anywhere there is internet 
len ratingfive I use most often to transfer files to fire stick 
len ratingfive I use this every single day and can t get by without it 
len ratingone  I just updated the app and every time I go to open it it crashes 
len ratingone Fix the crashing please 
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive Very handy as a photographer and musician for sharing files 
len ratingfive Size limit is the only problem but you can always upgrade
len ratingfour  I heart my Google Drive 
len ratingfour It works great for backing up small files here and there especially at times when i forgot to keep a USB drive handy 
len ratingfour Though i do wish that the default free storage capacity is more than gb guess i better delete a coupla those vacation vids that i d shared after uploading them to my drive last year 
len ratingfour  P And if I could only download onto my iPhone my uploaded music without any trouble which i currently cannot w the iOS ggl Drv app 
len ratingfour I still love my drive though nevertheless 
len ratingfour  Great way to save your files or other important documents 
len ratingfive Love google drive it has saved my professional life several times 
len ratingfive Keeping important documents organized and handy has never been so easy
len ratingfive Great Tool for Business Professionals to attach documents to emails and share them with their colleagues and customers 
len ratingfive  Smooth and secure app
len ratingthree Which is twice the amount of space Google is offering for the same price 
len ratingfive I mean how could you not love it 
len ratingfive  Drive has made easy for anyone to store access and organize file on the go 
len ratingfour  Pros Nearest cloud based competitor in quality to MS Office and iWork More reliable cloud access than iWork NEW Notifications of any changes 
len ratingfour This is in addition to file comments Cons Designed around composing documents instead of collaboration contrast w Quip where conversation is easy to see and central to user experience 
len ratingfour The once king of collaboration fell seriously behind Quip but has made a strong comeback 
len ratingfour Every download of those alternatives should be considered a vote against managers who stifled internal google efforts to innovate along those lines 
len ratingfour To the credit of the new collaborative improvements at Google Drive you can request updates for any doc you want to monitor closely but it is not the default so you don t have an Updates stream like that feature in Quip 
len ratingfive  I used drive app so important
len ratingfive  I love it 
len ratingfive I use it for not only work but also for my personal info 
len ratingfive Love that I can access all the info without logging in and out between accounts 
len ratingfive Great for song storage 
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfive Would recommend to anyone 
len ratingfive Five Star all the way 
len ratingfour  I would give it stars if it wasn t for the compatibility issues between google slides and power point 
len ratingfour Working on a ppt version than uploading as google slides to collaborate with the team then converting back to ppt can lead to serious loss of formatting 
len ratingfive Can t beat the price FREE
len ratingfive  Keeping tabs on different bands progress hasn t been easier
len ratingfive  I love how easy it is to share documents with others and how several people can edit one document at the same time 
len ratingfive It s so convenient to be able to share documents from my cell phone 
len ratingfive  Hi I ve been using google drive for my school under my school email and it works but there s just one problem I can t open a picture or anything on my folders or nothing it shows up like it should but it doesn t allow me to view it by clicking on it and I was hoping you could fix this ASAP 
len ratingfive Please and thank you 
len ratingfive  Amazing app specially for work and school 
len ratingfive thank you
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingthree  It s convenient to be able to access this while mobile 
len ratingthree Editing is difficult navigation through a document lags 
len ratingthree App freezes frequently 
len ratingfive  Use it for work and personal best way to share files and store safe documents 
len ratingfive Nothing better 
len ratingfive My life has become so organized thanks to GDrive 
len ratingfive I don t know how I functioned with cheesy pen drives prior to this 
len ratingfive  It is excessively to any computer as long as you re the passwords 
len ratingfive One of security for season any other cloud storage i m sure he files it in with your encrypted or you can send it unencrypted which I love the most
len ratingfive  viwe
len ratingfive I love Google drive 
len ratingfive It s essential to my life 
len ratingfive  I love it 
len ratingfive I use it to store most anything but love it for all my knitting patterns 
len ratingfive I can bring them up at any time they don t get messed up while I am knitting and they are there if I need them again 
len ratingfive Just great 
len ratingfive  This solves all my storage and document issues 
len ratingfive Way better then iCloud and those pages apps 
len ratingfive It gives you Unlimited storage when you use it properly 
len ratingfive Also Microsoft stinks 
len ratingfive Integrates with iOS in so many ways 
len ratingfive Works great in combination with google docs sheets and slides 
len ratingfive  Works very well
len ratingone Used it consistently in iOS without a hitch 
len ratingone Today while trying to access a Word doc app claims there is no internet connection 
len ratingone If that were true how did i get to the folder in the first place 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive  Seamless integration intuitive and user friendly app
len ratingfive  The app version works a lot more smoothly than on my computer 
len ratingfive For some reason no matter my download speed on my computer my phone is able to do better over the network 
len ratingfive  Never any issues with this app 
len ratingfive Easy set up and works reliably 
len ratingfive  Very resourceful to use for college 
len ratingfive  Excelente and easy to used
len ratingfour Love it
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfive Drive is an excellent tool to have on all phones it contains multiple functions that one may have to get use to but that s done you ll love it 
len ratingfive Thanks Drive 
len ratingfive Love having the ability to get into my Drive even on my phone 
len ratingfive  I make spreadsheets for everything 
len ratingfive Perfect better than excel 
len ratingone  It s awesome for storage but on the computer it s way better you can do anything you can write on it and put pictures on it but on the tablet you can t do anything you buy several different apps just to get started so if you re looking for a app to everything do buy it 
len ratingfive  Thanks google
len ratingfive Working as planned 
len ratingfive Couldn t run my life without this 
len ratingfive  Best app ever 
len ratingfour Many updates have made this my go to for sharing work on multiple platforms 
len ratingfour The upgrades to sheets will be challenging to opt for company product given the flexibility and integration across platforms 
len ratingfour  The app has gotten way better 
len ratingfour Great for file sharing and storage features 
len ratingfive Simple interface 
len ratingfive All the functions I need to get my work done 
len ratingfive  Nuff said 
len ratingfour  My primary use for google drive is to store and easily access docs for business 
len ratingfour Works well for the purposes in which I use them 
len ratingfour One draw back is that the sync can be a little slow but a great app over all 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive  Fantastic app 
len ratingfive Very useful and user friendly 
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfive Works well
len ratingfive Awesome App 
len ratingfour  This is a great general storage app but I have found it to be slower in overall syncing than Dropbox or MS one drive 
len ratingfour Google needs to take a few lessons from Dropbox and provide faster sync provide password protection for shared links and a few other advantages that DBx has 
len ratingfour All need to provide better scaling price plans for needs between Tb and Tb 
len ratingfour Why not have Tb plans for a single account also 
len ratingfour Or better yet bill users for the actual space used rather than paying for the unused maximum available storage plan 
len ratingfour My needs scale up end down and I hate to pay for unused storage 
len ratingfour If Google did that I d consolidate all other accounts to Google 
len ratingfour By charging users for the maximum storage ceiling rather than the storage space used Google does not need to provide cloud storage hardware for the actual plan need thereby selling unused the same unused storage capacity to multiple users how fair is that 
len ratingfour It is like a grocery store charging you for a full shopping cart when there only a few items in it a checkout 
len ratingone  When I open the app the proper screen show up but no matter what I press nothing happens 
len ratingone This is a recent problem 
len ratingone I am a teacher on the go and this is a problem for me 
len ratingfive Such good much wow
len ratingfive  A very useful app saves my phone memory
len ratingfive This app is perfect for my purposes 
len ratingfive I just wish I could set it to open into a default folder of my choosing 
len ratingfive  Easy uploads and peace of mind for backups 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It has saved my butt so many times I have lost count 
len ratingfive Thanks google
len ratingfive Works great for viewing 
len ratingfive You can t really do much with Microsoft office products are 
len ratingfive But combined with the desktop apps all in all it s a pretty powerful tool
len ratingfive This app solves nearly every need for group document sharing 
len ratingfive I like it a lot 
len ratingfive Google provides great services in so many arenas 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and share docs 
len ratingfive Goes with you on any device and is incredibly easy to share with anyone 
len ratingfive Much easier than The Cloud iCloud Dropbox IMHO
len ratingtwo  So the app was working perfectly fine on my iPhone running iOS before I updated to the latest version and now the app doesn t respond at all once I open it 
len ratingtwo Quite frustrating since I heavily rely on it 
len ratingfive Incredibly fast 
len ratingfive  Fantastic app we use it for works on a daily basis great product from google 
len ratingfive In use this app daily 
len ratingfive  No matter what you think of Google they do put out some good stuff 
len ratingfive La mejor
len ratingfive One repository for everything cheap storage space and FA security 
len ratingfive Doesn t get any better than this 
len ratingfive MANY applications work with Google Drive 
len ratingfive It s very useful 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive A great product that works well 
len ratingone  get rid of it 
len ratingfive  quick and clear
len ratingfive  Very useful 
len ratingfive  Best online storage option out there
len ratingfive I use it all the time 
len ratingfive It is indispensable 
len ratingfive Placing links in emails messages etc is easy and useful 
len ratingfive  I have been using Google Drive for several years and I use it as my personal document management system it is wonderful with great search capabilities 
len ratingfive I am gradually becoming paperless 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingfive  Everything works better with gdrive
len ratingtwo  The fact that I have to copy a URL open the photo in the browser click download icon open it in new browser tab and then use the iPhone share function to download my own image is a terrible UX design 
len ratingtwo Just let me download in one click 
len ratingtwo I get that you want me to rely on Google Drive but the best way to do that is to make the workflows good and have the product satisfy my not your needs 
len ratingthree I am not a fan of The Cloud 
len ratingthree I just do not trust my stuff on someone else s server 
len ratingthree There is no need for me to be apologetic here my stuff my decision 
len ratingthree I use GoogeDrive as a trailer rig for regularly accessed files I don t feel like toying with iTune s sillinesses to accomplish the same thing files I want to use while ambulatory quickly and as easily as I use them on a MS opsys based desktop personal computer at home 
len ratingthree I simply want to copy files I plan to use for a week to my mobile device so I don t have to mix it with the files sitting on my device 
len ratingthree GD allows that 
len ratingthree It is quick and dirty 
len ratingthree Copy the files to the GD directory on my desktop within moments I am able to leave my abode and use the files 
len ratingthree  Stars for that easiness 
len ratingthree I do not know the ins outs of the GD app but I am not a fan of its resident audio player and it seems to have a problem finding thus using by default the audio player I installed on my iPhs 
len ratingthree Because its resident tool for using the audio files sitting within the app cannot find and thus use a very popular audio player I am subtracting stars 
len ratingthree When that gets fixed I ll modify my review Thank you 
len ratingfive  I was previously using Dropbox until one day all my files were missing both on the desktop install and browser version 
len ratingfive The files I could salvage from my hard drive were immediately moved into my google drive 
len ratingfive I haven t had any problems all documents sync across all devices and I can access them with no issue online or offline 
len ratingfive I have no issue with which apps are able to open documents either 
len ratingfive Should ve gone the google suite way a long time ago 
len ratingfive It s free plenty of storage and extremely intuitive 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I can access it from anywhere and it holds all my stuff 
len ratingfive If I need more space on my phone I can store my pictures 
len ratingfive Absolutely recommend this app especially if you do work from home or on the go 
len ratingfive Google Drive is easy to use and I can access my documents from anywhere
len ratingfive  everyday 
len ratingfive Great for sharing files also 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive As a music teacher I very quickly found my computer unable to store all my lessons and music tracks 
len ratingfive Now I am able to teach from any location and storage is a no sweat proposition 
len ratingfive  It s free and it works well 
len ratingthree I love how the update says fixed something that in rare cases could cause the app to crash 
len ratingthree Rare 
len ratingthree On iOS 
len ratingthree Apps crash and bug out like there was a sale on such things 
len ratingfour It s an awesome app to store all your photos and videos but I feel like we need more storage 
len ratingfour I have plenty of videos but I have over more videos I need to store somewhere safe 
len ratingfour It s great 
len ratingfive Yes sometimes it doesn t have every option I could dream of but by and large this utility changes the way I work completely 
len ratingfive Used it in high school college graduate school and in jobs 
len ratingfive Really a great product
len ratingfour Thank you google 
len ratingfive Couldn t do my job without it
len ratingfive  It s tough to be able to use Google Docs on a cell phone but I think they did a good job given the restrictions 
len ratingone  Video shows processing FOREVER then finally it looks like it s loaded and then the play button has a circle and a line through it so can t play the video on iPad 
len ratingone img mov 
len ratingone video 
len ratingone Pretty pathetic Apple products can t play any video to begin with 
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour  DECENT
len ratingfive Allows me to work on my documents on my desktop and then pick up where I left off right on my phone when I m on the go 
len ratingfive  Need to install Docs Sheets and or Slides to edit their respective documents 
len ratingfour  Does everything I needed to do except for automatically crop a document photo like the android version of Drive does 
len ratingfive  It gets the job done 
len ratingfive  Awesome app 
len ratingfive Great for storing files 
len ratingfive I love the ease of use and the fact that the edits take affect immediately so anyone whose using the files can see the changes as they occur 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive  This is a great app 
len ratingfive Files are easy to access via the file structure or from recently added files 
len ratingfive Full screen viewing is very helpful 
len ratingfour  Easy enough for me to upload files but sharing files does not always work or is too difficult for the recipient to get the files 
len ratingfour Not sure what the problem is but I ve had multiple recipients say they could not access the files 
len ratingfive Drive is a really great app and easy to use in my phone especially when I need to access files while I m commuting to work or in thr car as a passenger 
len ratingfive I love that it s so easy to switch between my personal and business accounts 
len ratingfive Saves me a lot of time and u can use it anywhere 
len ratingfive  As the executive director of K is for Kids Foundation I mentor many students from around Collier County who are working together in projects both on and off site 
len ratingfive We needed a way for students to create and edit documents together but from afar

len ratingone Unfortunately when uploading any significant number of photos to my google drive it crashes every time 
len ratingone I had to start uploading in groups of and still yet there were random photos that would be missing 
len ratingone Very frustrating disappointing and inconvenient 
len ratingfive  Having Google Drive available to me on my Chromebook iPad and my phone is amazing

len ratingfive I absolutely love Drive

len ratingfive Drop your file into Google drive and you can access it from any computer or from your phone 
len ratingfive It s also a nice way to store files to free up space on your computer 
len ratingtwo  There should be easily accessible tutorials that offer alternatives for error messages

len ratingfive  Goggle drive is so helpful and useful I love it
len ratingfive  Very versatile 
len ratingfive So easy to pick up on a project from one device to another 
len ratingfive  Holds multiple files

len ratingone It s a good app to automate up downloading among devices

len ratingone However the photos and videos got disoriented 
len ratingone I mean they were upside down when viewing from my PC except the ones from the back camera or selfies 
len ratingone It s like a nightmare 
len ratingfour It s definitely nice to have access to files across multiple devices 
len ratingfour It takes some getting used to though and if you weren t anticipating being offline you might be sol

len ratingfive Don t know what I did without it 
len ratingfive Very handy
len ratingone This is unacceptable google makes people download their app in order to use it like I don t even want it on my phone they just force you to because my school in rare cases make students write report using google docs and all I need is to manage my file why couldn t I go on the website and just log in google makes you download their app so that way they make more money like they don t already have enough

len ratingfive  Having Google accounts makes life easier for me and my students 
len ratingfive I love that I can edit view and comment on shared documents 
len ratingfive I can work from home on school related projects or grad school items 
len ratingfive Management is easy 
len ratingfive I have multiple color coded folders for storing and locating 
len ratingfive There is a search bar that quickly locates material or people associated with my system 
len ratingfive One of my favorite features is the research tool that allows you to pull in pictures and it automatically cites the image s in your footnotes 
len ratingfive This is so important when teaching students about giving credit to others 
len ratingfive I LOVE my Google Drive 
len ratingfive  I play in a band and this app is honestly amazing for file sharing between a bunch of people 
len ratingfive  i love it 
len ratingfive Works great

len ratingfive  Especially if you create video content 
len ratingfour  But it has some quirks i don t like
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  It s simple clear and easy to use
len ratingfive  I would recommend it to anybody who doesn t want to fill up their computer 
len ratingfive We absolutely love it 
len ratingfive Entire staff

len ratingfive See above 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive I work from my car and take these documents on my smartphone and can email them on the go 
len ratingfive  For a teacher like me who collaborates with students Google Drive is amazing 
len ratingfive I can access everything from anywhere 
len ratingfive Best doc sharing experience on mobile 
len ratingfive It works 
len ratingfour  It is easy to use having an fairly intuitive interface 
len ratingfour I have pics automatically backed up and then later I rename and move them to other directories to organize by content date type or etc 
len ratingfour I get use of it for free which helps me like it more 
len ratingfour On the other hand 
len ratingfour I have lost HUNDREDS of files at a time using it because files didn t sync properly before my laptop automatically did an update 
len ratingfour I spent hours on phone without of their tech support persons but we couldn t find the lost files 
len ratingfour They were important but not vital files else I would have gone from it 
len ratingfour BE CAREFUL TO SYNC OFTEN if uploading or modifying more than a couple files 
len ratingfour Another down side is that associated apps such as Google Docs are huge 
len ratingfour Because of team sharing 
len ratingfour Other than that it s just a text editor talking about Google Docs 
len ratingfour Also seems odd or overly possessive that if a file created w another text editor is edited by GoogleDrive GoogleDocs combo it changes the file type and retains sole ownership of it 
len ratingfour How come it can t just save the file in the same existing type and not retain ownership of it 
len ratingfour I would like to have BATCH operations like to rename multiple files and or move them to a directory where I keep similar items 
len ratingfour I also would like to see the file size 
len ratingfour I know Google compresses them but how about an original and compressed size 
len ratingfour I will compress big pics so that I can get more in my allocated disk space but right now I don t know how to determine which to compress like by making them lower resolution and or cropping 
len ratingfour I tried google drive w my iPad and iPhone and it didn t work so well but the updates have been great 
len ratingfour I work part time for some different businesses and it s great to have access to all that I need 
len ratingfour Anytime anywhere on any device 
len ratingfive  Brilliant

len ratingfive  Have to say this is the most useful app in my iphone easily share the files with computer 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive  I can t see my life without this App 
len ratingtwo  Please add the option to disable the quick access view on top 
len ratingtwo This is very annoying as i dont have any option t disable
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive  performs really well 
len ratingfive I ve relied on drive for school for the past few weeks and have had no problems 
len ratingfive  Love the accessibility of having my files in the cloud and that s why I have pretty much given up Office and moved to Google docs
len ratingfive  Google drive is a versatile tool that is extremely easy to use from anywhere on a variety of platforms 
len ratingfive It has increased my productivity and collaboration

len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingtwo  Great app to work on for school except if videos are necessary 
len ratingtwo Impossible to export videos to apps such as iMovie to edit or even just download to my phone 
len ratingtwo Attempted to get a minute video downloaded for hours and I couldn t find a way 
len ratingtwo TL DR TERRIBLE FOR VIDEOS
len ratingfive  Love having my files and photos at the tip of my finger no matter where I am 
len ratingfive  Like most google products drive is incredibly intuitive 
len ratingfive I never wonder very long how to do anything with or within drive 
len ratingfive The answer usually presents itself retry quickly in one of the way to access menus 
len ratingfive It does what you want it to do can t ask for more than that 
len ratingfive  After they fixed the slow bug the drive is perfect to use and now i use it for all my bus n personal sharing
len ratingfive  Key to getting my work done the app on IPad is superb 
len ratingfive  This has become my friend 
len ratingfive I don t have to worry with keeping up with a portable disc 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive  Efficient tool 
len ratingfour  It provides access to files I need the most on demand

len ratingfour Good amount of free storage space 
len ratingfour Good security I like and appreciate the Touch ID capability 
len ratingfour Certainly recommended 
len ratingthree  Use to be highly reliable but lately trying to load Excel docs just open a blank excel sheet 
len ratingthree Really annoying when it s used for a business to check purchasing info and you have to fight with empty pages over and over again

len ratingfive Seems to be the best blend of cross platform functionality along with user friendly interface 
len ratingfive  Love this app 
len ratingfive Makes it easy to access files anywhere 
len ratingfive  It is easy to figure out
len ratingfive  I keep all my notes and documents in one place and share between all my devices 
len ratingfive I used to carry around a flash drive but no more 
len ratingone It takes hours to download a mB PDF for some unknown reason 
len ratingone Everything else seems fine and I was able to download a folder of MB photos 
len ratingfive  Super friendly and useful 
len ratingfive Works well 
len ratingfour  After the new update from the old UI I have no complaints yet 
len ratingfour Everything works as expected 
len ratingfour I have used it to transfer funds deposit checks and view statements online 
len ratingfive  No matter which cloud storage solution you utilize you ll probably need to access Google drive since the company is so ubiquitous with internet use at some point 
len ratingfive Google Drive is a must have for gaining access to all of your data from their server 
len ratingfive Bonus all Google slides Doc files do not count against your data storage total 
len ratingfive Additionally they give you a good amount of free teaser storage before you ll need to purchase 
len ratingfive My favourite App for cloud storage 
len ratingfive Although it s good for us to manage our files so please get the Team Drives and the new Google Sites for tablets phones if possible 
len ratingfive  I ve been using it for a while and it keeps all photo just a touch away EH
len ratingfive  Super easy to access all your files from anywhere
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour I use it for all my stuff 
len ratingfour Best price for storage and features 
len ratingfour New ability to select and move multiple items is great 
len ratingfour Switching between apps to be able to edit docs is annoying but everyone else is doing the same thing and has for years Like Microsoft and Apple 
len ratingfour I would love it if I could view my google docs within the app and then open them in the other apps when I wanted to edit That would make this stars to me 
len ratingfive  Works perfectly across all my machines and operating systems
len ratingfive I have most of them but this the pen I use the most
len ratingfour  Works great sharing to drive 
len ratingfour Quick uploads I can access from any device

len ratingfive Also easy to switch between google accounts if you have multiple 
len ratingfive I have no complaints 
len ratingone  After running updates on computer with iTunes you still have to manually update all Google crap from each mobile device

len ratingone That wastes my time 
len ratingfive  Very easy to use share files store important documents 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Seamless 
len ratingfour This is absolutely great for when I need to use it at home for a homework assignment but there are some things it can improve on

len ratingfive  As a user of multiple devices across multiple operating systems Mac iOS Windows Windows Windows Mobile Drive is an irreplaceable necessity 
len ratingfive All my documents are synchronized on all my devices and Google provides plentiful free storage 
len ratingfive  iOS when trying to open Excel Word PowerPoint type documents you must have the equivalent Google app Sheets Docs etc 
len ratingfive and I ve learned you must mark each document as Available Offline otherwise a blank document opens 
len ratingfive Otherwise seamless synchronization and access are outstanding 
len ratingfive  Using it throughout my college years and now for my personal and business files has been indispensable 
len ratingfive Traveling out of the country I ve been able to access share and print so many documents 
len ratingfive The best part of a great online resource like my fave go to Google Drive is it s free

len ratingfive It s really great 
len ratingfive Google will some day rule the world 
len ratingfive The best cloud storage service there is 
len ratingfive I have good save everything my work
len ratingfive Works well easy to use
len ratingfive  Just don t know what I would do without you G Drive 
len ratingfive Praiseworthy endeavor 
len ratingfive Still delivering as promised 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive  This is really how I m getting through college honestly
len ratingfive  I love this app
len ratingfive Especially good if you keep running out of space on your phone 
len ratingfive I ve used on my android phone and iPhone easily 
len ratingthree App is solid but it would be great to be able to pay audio files in drive in the background while viewing other files 
len ratingthree Currently the audio stops as soon as you leave to go to another file 
len ratingfive Got rid of Quick Access so back to five stars 
len ratingfive  I use this app for many things including uploading videos of my son playing baseball so college coaches can see them 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive  Very good and fluid app
len ratingfive  You know what I mean 
len ratingfive Just get it
len ratingfive  Very reliable does what I need it to
len ratingfive Use it all the time 
len ratingfive  Works great for on demand access to my files 
len ratingfive Using it now as I transition docs from one device to another 
len ratingfive Will now keep them in the cloud and stop worrying about access version control and backups 
len ratingfive  I use it for everything 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Great way to share pics docs et al 
len ratingfive I Love Google Drive 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I love this app because it s so easy to use for one 
len ratingfive It makes organizing whatever I need to put in here super duper easy 
len ratingfive I have so many uses for it and it takes care of my every need for the app overall 
len ratingfive One of google s flagship apps executed flawlessly and bug free for iOS 
len ratingfive I couldn t be happier with this application 
len ratingfive Paired with google docs I m able to stay organized in all aspects of my life and collaborate with others easily 
len ratingfive  would download again 
len ratingfive Great and easy to use
len ratingfive Esta aplicaci n se la recomiendo a cualquiera que tenga archivos en Google Drive 
len ratingfive Es muy til para acceder a esos archivos 
len ratingfive  They listened to feedback yay 
len ratingfive Download this right now 
len ratingone If you are using your iDevice s fingerprint scanner to unlock Google Drive this latest update removes that functionality without any warning 
len ratingone The only way I was able to able to access my files was by removing and subsequently reinstalling my Google account from all Google apps on my device 
len ratingone Another fine effort from the script kiddies at Google 
len ratingfive I use this app consistently for work and I have never had any issues 
len ratingfive A pleasure to use 
len ratingthree  Got a little better since last time 
len ratingfive  Really easy to access all my documents that I need to view when I m not at work or at a computer 
len ratingfive  An absolute must if you love Google anything 
len ratingfive This is the best cloud storage to date 
len ratingfive easy smooth and professional 
len ratingfive Works great with iOS and Android 
len ratingfive I work in the Marine industry and I sell boats 
len ratingfive I use this for work all the time 
len ratingfive I have all my inventory warranty info etc on my g drive 
len ratingfive Also you can make any doc available offline so when I don t have signal wifi I still have access to everything 
len ratingfive  It
len ratingfive  Easy way to save files 
len ratingfive Love the Scan option 
len ratingfive  Google Drive has been critical in assisting me with transitioning work documents to personal computers and vice versa 
len ratingfive I can t imagine life without it 
len ratingfive  Is a very useful app for the common day a very intuitive and pleasing to the eye it is recommended 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is the one application I tell everyone they need to be using if they do any project management creative or otherwise 
len ratingfive It has been by my side through thick and thin and with it s accessibility for multiple users on shared folders has made all my collaborative projects very effective 
len ratingfive I would give GDrive stars any day of the week 
len ratingone  Blocking use of the app while the recent documents load was a mistake 
len ratingone I no longer use drive instead access documents directly through the sheets or docs apps 
len ratingone Sad because drive was more convenient 
len ratingone Please fix this Google so I can use drive again 
len ratingfour Good 
len ratingfive I ve used drive for years for both work and graduate studies 
len ratingfive I love the convenience or access and sharing 
len ratingfive The apps is easy to use even with more than Google account and switching between them is simple 
len ratingfive Try it 
len ratingone  What an unreliable broken app 
len ratingone If you try to export documents it fails every single time 
len ratingone If you convert the documents to another format you better get a beer or because you will grow a full beard before it finishes 
len ratingone Also trying to open a power point is probably the best test of a person s patience I have ever seen 
len ratingone You get only blank slides 
len ratingone So if you hate yourself and haven t found a reason to end it all yet get this app 
len ratingthree Great cloud easy to use but fails in being an all in one app 
len ratingthree Need docs and sheets to open documents 
len ratingthree OneDrive does the same by using one simple app instead of using apps to accomplish the same feat 
len ratingfive Super convenient and accessible on my phone and iPad 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Once again Google makes life simple 
len ratingfive It s truly amazing that I can drag virtually any file from my computer into Google Drive on my desktop and within a minute open it on my phone 
len ratingfive Thank you Google team 
len ratingfive  Helps me share stuff like videos and files w friends 
len ratingfive Easy interface 
len ratingfive Thx for trying on dis one goog
len ratingfive  Been a great tool to keep track of all the needed materials for work 
len ratingfive Thanks google drive never ending
len ratingfive Le a adiria una contrase a para acceder desde el movil 
len ratingfive I love being able to put everything in one place in an organized fashion 
len ratingfive This app has changed my life and improved my productivity 
len ratingthree  Waste of space and shows irrelevant files at the top 
len ratingfive  Very intuitive and you can t beat TB space 
len ratingfive Plenty of capacity and easy to use across all devices 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfive I can t think of a way to improve it 
len ratingfive I have a variety of platforms that access the same files 
len ratingfive These are Windows iPad Air Android and Ubuntu Linux 
len ratingfive All need access to the same information and interface 
len ratingfive Google Drive and the Google tools allow me to get to this information regardless of the platform 
len ratingfive  This is a must have app for students and business professionals alike 
len ratingfive I use it every day and couldn t live without it 
len ratingfive Shame on me 
len ratingfive I ve been a gmail user for years and just never took advantage of the drive feature 
len ratingfive I don t know what I was doing with my life 
len ratingfive Now I can t live with out it 
len ratingfive I access it for everything 
len ratingfive I m an artist and the drive is how my team and I share everything from documents to performance shots to video reels to music and the little bit of money I pay for extra storage is money well spent 
len ratingfive Drive 
len ratingfive  Awesome tool 
len ratingfive User friendly and very reliable 
len ratingone For whatever reason the Quick Access list shows pictures of people I don t even know 
len ratingone When I check the info of the pictures it shows people that they are shared with and I m not on the lists 
len ratingone It s weird but funny being able to view random people s photos lol 
len ratingone Nice privacy 
len ratingfive Always does the job
len ratingfive Best of the cloud and my go to solution for team 
len ratingfive The limited functionalities and formatting is there for the sake of practicality 
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingfive  Great to save documents l wouldn t know what to do without it 
len ratingfive  Makes sharing and storing really easy 
len ratingfour  The Google Drive app blew me away by how good and useful it is 
len ratingfour I m able to access and read my docs and photos whenever I want 
len ratingfour The only problem I have with it is that I had to buy an entirely different app so I can edit my docs 
len ratingfour Despite the Google Docs app being free which is very convenient the idea of buying another app just for another is a bit ridiculous 
len ratingfour But it s still an awesome app though 
len ratingfive  I manage all my files on multiple devices very easy to use 
len ratingfour  I have used this pretty minimally over the last year but so far I have had no notable issue 
len ratingfour Even the UI is pretty solid which is a step forward for Google compared with some of their other apps like Chrome 
len ratingone This app is good BUT I CANT TRANSFER GOOGLE DRIVE PHOTOS TO PHOTOS 
len ratingone If you save the image you have to do one at a time and no information transfers 
len ratingone This is a big problem and needs an update NOW
len ratingfive  Such a useful app 
len ratingfive Google Drive is great 
len ratingfive Not only does it provide a good deal of storage space but I can fill it with anything I desire from my computer and have it instantly available on my phone without any drain on my phone s memory 
len ratingfive Good job Google and thank you 
len ratingfive  PDF 
len ratingfive Just the best 
len ratingfive Incre ble funcionalidad y f cil acceso a todos tus archivos

len ratingfive It is one of the best apps I have ever found 
len ratingfive I strongly recommend it to anybody 
len ratingfive Super easy to use great for sharing audio messages 
len ratingfive  Has a lot of features and virtually zero bugs 
len ratingfive Gotta give a shoutout to their developers they do a great job 
len ratingtwo  Even google own photos app does not see the photos on the drive in different folders 
len ratingtwo No way to just save the file to gallery 
len ratingfive Great place to organize your photos and videos 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive  So far not a single problem 
len ratingfive I love that all my files are there whenever I need them regardless of the device I m on 
len ratingfive Sharing GD files with others is not anyways so smooth but I think that s cuz people aren t familiar with GD 
len ratingfive  I have loyalty too google for this app and keeping it real
len ratingfive Practically designed and stable 
len ratingfive Meets my storage productivity and confidence needs in one app 
len ratingfive Intuitive
len ratingfive Use it a lot for individual and group use 
len ratingfive Find it convenient and easy to use 
len ratingfive I use it daily and from laptop tablet and iPhone 
len ratingfive Intuitive interface 
len ratingfive  You can use all time 
len ratingfive This is a very necessary tool for digital file access from any device 
len ratingfive sometimes it saves my life always it saves my time
len ratingfive  This is an excellent product if you take and share pics during parties get together meetings planning events 
len ratingfive Taking trips etc 
len ratingfive It has made sharing a breeze with just a link 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Google always outdoes themselves and Drive is no exception 
len ratingfive It s the handiest way to collaborate online for FREE and very intuitive 
len ratingfive  Works great 
len ratingfive Easy customizable share options for files and pictures 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfour  Very simple to use across all my devices 
len ratingfour Even with Blast internet service upload takes way longer than you d think 
len ratingfour All in all a fantastic app service tho
len ratingone  A great app rendered utterly worthless 
len ratingone For whatever reason audio files don t always play and as someone who works with audio this has rendered the app completely useless
len ratingfive  Talk about organization 
len ratingfive I LOVE this app 
len ratingfive I ve had it forever and have just now discovered the depths of its beauty of an app
len ratingfive  My experience only continues to improve 
len ratingfive Drive is great as is the iOS app now it wasn t always 
len ratingfive Easy collaboration great security a beautiful intuitive interface 
len ratingfive Why use anything else 
len ratingthree  I love google drive but the latest update either needs to be rolled back or revised 
len ratingthree When opening the app is comes to a halt and you need to wait seconds to access your files 
len ratingthree Not sure who was beta testing but I m hoping Google fixes this issue asap 
len ratingthree Other than this latest issue I m very happy with Google drive and will change it to stars when fixed 
len ratingfour Or cannot remember if it is on the PC phone or ipad or whatever gadget one uses 
len ratingfour Portable accessible from anywhere granted you do need wifi connectivity and easy to shift to anytime 
len ratingfour It took me a while to use Drive for all my saves but now I do and breathe a sigh of relief every time my aging PC fails to start up yet again 
len ratingfour I now ignore the fear that big brother in its Google incarnation is looking into my stuff 
len ratingfour My stuff isn t that important except to me 
len ratingfour I do use two backup hard drives too just in case Google s servers decide to croak 
len ratingfour Only thing to be careful of if you are a new user is that you must refresh if your device needs that to see what you have just done so that Drive syncs right away 
len ratingfive  My wife and I use this to manage our lives lol 
len ratingfive We use this for bills home owner insurance car insurance documents home remodeling ideas invoices for home and car repairs vacation itineraries new vacation ideas etc on and on 
len ratingfive This helps us organize our life and we both have access to the folders and if either of us makes edits the other is always looped in 
len ratingfive It s increased our communication fold we re always on the same page now 
len ratingfive Drive works so super well I couldn t work w o it 
len ratingfive Dropbox is great too but their storage is more expensive 
len ratingfive I pay for drive rather than use one drive for business which I wouldn t pay for because it is provided by my job but I find to synchronize less well and definitely less quickly 
len ratingfive Google thank you 
len ratingfive  Wonderful and very convenient 
len ratingfive This is a great app for editing videos pics on mac then downloading to phone 
len ratingfive Lots of storage
len ratingfive  Take my money take my car heck take my cat but don t take my Google Drive 
len ratingfive To know it is to love it 
len ratingfive  My drive is good
len ratingfive I recently moved all my photos emails documents and contacts over to Google drive 
len ratingfive Merging iCloud Drive and OneDrive files into one single system has been very smooth and easy to manage on iOS 
len ratingfive I highly recommend Apple for hardware and Google for software 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfour There should be a easier way to share drives between accounts personal account school account 
len ratingfour Also I would like a better way to organize the files 
len ratingfour Maybe colors or pictures 
len ratingfive  Yep I can move photos and videos to anywhere I have google drive installed 
len ratingfive Nice

len ratingfour No complaints 
len ratingfour The best storage drive
len ratingfive  I can do everything I need for work and personal life 
len ratingfive It s incredible and I would be lost without Googledrive 
len ratingfive This is a great app
len ratingfive  Amazing Cloud 
len ratingfive  The subject of my review says it all 
len ratingfive Although I use this app all the time I found it even more useful recently during job interviews 
len ratingfive I like to prepare my questions for the interviewer ahead of time 
len ratingfive So typically I d get to an interview early and sit in my car and review my questions that I put into Word and uploaded to Google Drive 
len ratingfive I also would upload each position job description and review them periodically 
len ratingfive Anyway I did get the job offer I wanted as well 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Even streaming videos 
len ratingfive  Love this app
len ratingfive Good job
len ratingtwo  Uploads constantly fail when on wifi but work fine on cellular data yes multiple wifi networks tested 
len ratingtwo Reinstalled the app restored phone

len ratingfive I use it for everything 
len ratingone  No joke at this moment my newest apple device is a iPod Touch th gen Its maxed out on and guess what Google Drive no longer syncs so I had to troubleshoot 
len ratingone First I tried letting it sit for a few hours 
len ratingone It was hanging and refused to sync any files 
len ratingone I tried updating it to the latest version iOS supported No luck 
len ratingone Then it was a try to delete the app and restore via my backup 
len ratingone Still no luck 
len ratingone I tried downgrading to the last supported iOS version 
len ratingone Nope still refuses to sync 
len ratingone Ironically my computer syncs fine 
len ratingone I m lost at all words because like I said my iPod is my newest apple device and I don t have money and won t for the next few years for a new one 
len ratingone I try to get support and its like a gigantic middle finger in my face 
len ratingone Fortunetly I have other apps I can use but man why do you have to abandon support for someone who cannot afford the newest iPhone or iPod
len ratingfive  Great product 
len ratingfive Never need the MS office again 
len ratingfive I like having a place to backup my pictures
len ratingfive I haven t had a bit of trouble since I started using google apps they simplify life and make it easy to get yourself organized 
len ratingfive Keep doing what you do Google 
len ratingone  Unable to update download the app at all 
len ratingfive Why everyone doesn t use this idk but it s awesome 
len ratingfive Like a file cabinet on the go 
len ratingone When I attempted to download the app it hijacked my phone logged me out of all of my social media and deleted all of my pictures 
len ratingfive Super helpful college student approved

len ratingfive Someone should get a raise for making this happen 
len ratingfive Benefits are for employees and customers 
len ratingfive Who else does that 
len ratingfive  This is a good app for transferring between devises 
len ratingfive Been using drive for about five years or so 
len ratingfive Recommend it
len ratingfive  I absolutely love the app 
len ratingfive So convenient and easy 
len ratingthree Google should understand that iOS Design Language is really different from Android 
len ratingthree Stop bringing material design to iOS apps it feels weird and clingy 
len ratingthree Also as others cloud storage apps Google Drive should have its iMessage App 
len ratingfive  This app is awesome because it clears up storage on my phone so I don t have a crap ton of photos and I don t feel bad when I delete them 
len ratingfive No faults clear all the way just pure dopeness 
len ratingfive  Best file management app all in one thank you google
len ratingfive  Google is number one so is its Drive cloud storage 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Head and shoulders better product than Dropbox user friendly fast lots of options
len ratingfive  Fast and very accessible from any device
len ratingfour I love being able to move from my computer to my phone so seamlessly 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive I use it daily 
len ratingfive Better than saving on a HD and easily accessible from other computers 
len ratingfive Share with family when planning a trip and sharing of photos 
len ratingfive Awesome sauce 
len ratingfive  Stop reading reviews and download it already 
len ratingfive Greatness love it
len ratingfour So far so good 
len ratingfive  Best mobile app I have
len ratingfour  Easy 
len ratingfour Consistent 
len ratingfour Don t like the pile of temp files it creates that clog up the lanes wish it would auto erase them instead of having to regularly clean up 
len ratingfour  This is be of the easiest clouds to use 
len ratingfour The only thing I don t like is any Microsoft docs spreadsheets open in a Google format not as easy for me 
len ratingfour Other than that love it
len ratingfive Highly recommended because Apple charges an arm and a leg for cloud storage plus Google drive is beyond better than iCloud
len ratingfive  LOVE IT 
len ratingfive It does what it should 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  Very useful
len ratingfive  Really a must for everyone 
len ratingfour  good app but need more free space please
len ratingfive It s amazing that you can get all of the functionality just as easily on your phone as on your computer

len ratingfive  Awesome features Very very helpful for my buisness Thanks google
len ratingfive I use Drive daily 
len ratingfive Has made itself indispensable 
len ratingfive  Love it
len ratingfive  It s just so easy to use 
len ratingfive  A hard Drive for my Brain 
len ratingfive Thank you so much Google 
len ratingfive Helps me keep it together 
len ratingone When uploading photos it s not showing all of them 
len ratingone The ones in iCloud not fully downloaded aren t available to select 
len ratingone And the albums in a folder are all spread out 
len ratingone It s just a mess 
len ratingone Bad UI and UX all around 
len ratingfive  Excellent resource 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive They are constantly updating and offering more convenience with the interface 
len ratingfive The best app for storage Google won on this one 
len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingfive  There isn t any BS getting in my way can t complain 
len ratingfive  I have used this in both my personal and business life 
len ratingfive It has made things much simpler 
len ratingone  app 
len ratingfive I enjoy it 
len ratingfive  Fantastic Can t live without this valuable tool You can take where ever you go Easy to use I think this is the best program out there Plus Google is very dependable I give it S Lee Hersh
len ratingfour It seems odd to me that the google drive app itself is not workable and must be serviced by google docs sheets etc 
len ratingfour Ideally it would all be in the same app 
len ratingfour It takes a lot of time to go from app to app like that and reduces performance 
len ratingone  Whenever I need to upload from my phone it usually fails saying no internet connection when one is present 
len ratingone Doesn t matter if I m on wifi or cellular network 
len ratingone I ve wiped me phone and it still does it after that 
len ratingfive I like this app very much because I can share large files very easily 
len ratingfive  While it would be good to have more editing abilities in Docs the platform is fantastic and allows easier sharing for teamwork 
len ratingfive Changes the way we work 
len ratingfour  Deleting files right in plan sight is obvious 
len ratingfive  This tool is great 
len ratingfive I can access my files from any of my devices 
len ratingfive The amount of data they allow for free is way more than Apple and the ability to share files is simple 
len ratingfive I have worked simultaneously on a shared doc while discussing it on the phone with a coworker 
len ratingfive I m a big fan of google drive 
len ratingfive  I use this daily 
len ratingfive If you travel for business and need to have access to your documents through your phone or other device or you have nothing like this in your inventory you need this 
len ratingfive It integrates well with MS Office products 
len ratingfive Getting GB for FREE is a tremendous value and will work for nearly anything short of volumes of photos or videos 
len ratingfive Coupled with some free VPN on your mobile devices makes it even better 
len ratingfive I use this everyday 
len ratingfive  I STILL this app 
len ratingfive  The best app I have ever had it goes across platforms I don t have to do anything it s straightforward and it works great I love this app it works really good
len ratingone The google drive app on my iPad won t sync 
len ratingone I have access to nothing more current than May on my iPad 
len ratingone I have logged out reinstalled restarted 
len ratingfive Google Drive is very useful and I enjoy it thoroughly 
len ratingfive Having used it to collaborate with clientele and job requirements 
len ratingfive Utilizing the in app access streamlines a lot of processes and makes a happy user 
len ratingfive Recommend to many people 
len ratingfive Works as advertised and has made things much easier for me 
len ratingfive Thanks for the convenience of this app 
len ratingfour Google drive makes file sharing between users easy and efficient but with my type of work I send a lot of audio files 
len ratingfour Drive is very inconsistent with its audio playback sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t 
len ratingfive  My very favorite
len ratingfive  I use it pretty much everyday on the go
len ratingfive  This is the best app you can have as a student every where you go your files are safe and are with you as long as you re connected you can work on your work ANYWHERE 
len ratingfive It s also amazing for group projects best app I ve ever used and that s saying a lot 
len ratingfive  This app makes it simple and intuitive to access your files in Google Drive

len ratingfive Also has built in viewers for most types of files like Word docs 
len ratingfive  I love Google 
len ratingfive Google drive makes my looking for work easier by allowing me to conveniently upload and download my resume 
len ratingfive I m empowered 
len ratingfive Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Keep up the awesomeness 
len ratingfive  Saved a lot of memory s
len ratingfive Couldn t imagine living without it 
len ratingfive Google 
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfive Use fingerprint ID with Drive make it so easy and secure 
len ratingfive  I use Drive a lot and it has never let me down 
len ratingfive I really like use this 
len ratingfive It is so simple 
len ratingfive I know that Apple has this but I have not figured out how to use it yet 
len ratingfive Lol 
len ratingfive  Been using this for years and never fails 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingthree In principal Google drive is my favorite file storage app 
len ratingthree It s really easy to use the single Google login and give access to other Google users 
len ratingthree The OS universality makes it really convenient 
len ratingthree The amount of free storage they give you is ample and their uptime is good 
len ratingthree They need to improve the app for iOS though 
len ratingthree It seems to be CPU mem intensive it seems to temporarily hang and if I click away or the screen locks during an upload it fails 
len ratingthree The throttling for up downloads is also a bit much 
len ratingthree There aren t really any better options 
len ratingthree But it s Google and you know they could do better 
len ratingthree Good enough isn t good enough 
len ratingfive  I am self employed always on the go 
len ratingfive It allows me to be ready with all my files when I need them 
len ratingfive  Use it everyday for everything

len ratingfive My workplace uses Google Apps for Business and we ALL take pictures of defective warranty items with Google Drive to send to our manufacturer it is a large part of our business 
len ratingfive Google Drive has increased our productivity as a company exponentially and turned a pain point into an easy task

len ratingfive I would give six stars if I could thank you Google

len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive Never crashes worked great 
len ratingone Get your act together 
len ratingone Test your products before release 
len ratingone You want people to beta test your products then pay them for their time 
len ratingfive  I use it for work files instead of a thumb drive 
len ratingfive And the ability to share folders is awesome 
len ratingfive I really have nothing negative to say about Google Drive 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is a MUST not only for teachers but EVERYONE

len ratingfive Very helpful

len ratingfive So easy and awesome thanks Google 
len ratingfive  Like 
len ratingfour  I use drive as a place to collect recipes 
len ratingfour It s a great way to store them on my iPad without using up my iPad s storage 
len ratingfour It also means I always have them with me because I can access them from my phone as well 
len ratingfive  I ve not had any problems accessing my data on any device 
len ratingfive It works enough said 
len ratingone  The last update added the Quick Access that was quite the opposite of quick 
len ratingone It like another review said when you open the app it looks like its ready to go but you tap and nothing happens 
len ratingone You then have to wait for the quick slow access to appear before you can do anything at all 
len ratingone Really frustrating 
len ratingone Please get rid of quick access I don t use it and never wanted it 
len ratingone Also the photo uploader is buggy 
len ratingone When you click on a photo you want to upload a check mark will appear but soon disappears 
len ratingone This is an issue if you are uploading lots of photos at once 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive  I enjoy this app on all my devices 
len ratingfive  works like magic 
len ratingfive No wahala at all 
len ratingfive  At least for now

len ratingfive I even share with the grandparents for they can t attend sports event or recitals 
len ratingfive  I can t say how much I appreciate being able to access documents from wherever I am on any of my devices 
len ratingfive If I just remembered a correction I need to make on a project document and it s am I can just reach for my phone on the night stand and add a note

len ratingfive  It gets the job done better than just about any other app I own 
len ratingfive  stars easy 
len ratingfour  Not always intuitive 
len ratingfour But coming in more and more handy every day 
len ratingfive Super useful and saves you from needed more gigs than you actually do 
len ratingfive I use Drive and GSuite across several industries and I m never left hanging 
len ratingfive Ease of use is top tier and the interface continuously improves 
len ratingfive This is one of the most useful apps I have I carry all my important information with me everywhere I go

len ratingfive Awesome product 
len ratingfive Love the off line feature 
len ratingfive I had doubts about using this app but to my surprise it has proven most useful

len ratingfive The utility of the drive app with google docs and suite is able to help me spend less time behind the laptop screen and more time getting other stuff done 
len ratingfive Is always available from any of my devices 
len ratingfive I m always up to date
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive Thanks for a nice app

len ratingfive  The best feature you can share things yet disable downloads 
len ratingfive More storage would be sweet 
len ratingfive  I love google drive and the ease with which I can maintain a lot of documents and update them to keep it current 
len ratingfive I use Drive across two devices primarily an iPhone S and an HP Chromebook 
len ratingfive While Drive would deserve the five star rating for its intuitive ease of use what makes it perfect is the ability to share specific folders and files effortlessly 
len ratingfive Drive is the hub of all things Google especially so when crossing the iPhone divide over into PC or Chromebook 
len ratingfive I use google drive for my resumes and other miscellaneous things that are very important 
len ratingfive It is very easy to view edit and send documents from 
len ratingfive I am very satisfied with this app 
len ratingfive Seriously it s Google it s gotta be great 
len ratingfive  I use Google Drive for just about everything 
len ratingfive I love that I can keep personal tasks and to do lists make a quick presentation or spreadsheet in seconds 
len ratingfive Then share it just about anywhere and with anyone 
len ratingfive The gigs of space is incredible but month is very reasonable for gb 
len ratingfive Love google drive 
len ratingfive I survive college thanks to this app 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone  It s pretty much impossible to upload a photo album 
len ratingone As you re selecting multiple images they just decide to deselect on their own 
len ratingone SO frustrating 
len ratingfive  Whether it s my r sum my tax returns or the kids SSN s and birth certificates I can t live without Google Drive 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work Google 
len ratingfive I love Google drive I use it for almost everything it s a great way to store and save files 
len ratingfive Can be accessed from almost anywhere 
len ratingfive One of my most favorite apps I use my phone every day 
len ratingfive  what more could you want 
len ratingfive Don t know how I ever lived without google drive 
len ratingfive Can t do without it 
len ratingone I ve had several pdfs somewhat large MB or so that I cannot read make available offline or download on my iPad Pro 
len ratingone After spinning for several minutes the app reports that there s no internet connection which is certainly not the case 
len ratingone Really awful user experience google drive team back to the drawing board 
len ratingfive Such an amazing tool generous space to keep esential stuff right at hand
len ratingfive  Easy and cheap 
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingfive Keeps freezing please help 
len ratingfive  I love everything about Google Drive 
len ratingthree I use google drive a lot more than my cloud and I love it but I hate that it takes forever to open my pictures I ve saved on there on my iPhone regardless if I m using my wifi or my phones data 
len ratingthree If you like using google drive it works better on android phones than iPhones 
len ratingfour I like it but please add new feature like uploading files from URL
len ratingfive  Great for docs on the go 
len ratingone  I use this app a lot 
len ratingone It s really useful for storing and sharing 
len ratingone However with the latest update it is very slow to load 
len ratingone It opens and it looks like it is loaded but when you tap nothing happens 
len ratingone Then your recent documents show up across the top and you can tap or scroll 
len ratingone I m assuming that feature is slowing the app down 
len ratingone Not only that but I don t want that feature 
len ratingone Sometimes you don t want to open the app and see a preview of what I have recently uploaded updated 
len ratingone This is made especially frustrating when the app acts frozen 
len ratingone It creates a potential situation where the app is frozen with files you do not want displayed 
len ratingfive  Drive is Driving to first place on best applications 
len ratingfive It gives me the drive to use my offline music more and more m Google offers free storage 
len ratingfive Wish all would be like Google and offer freedom for us 
len ratingfive Thank you google

len ratingfive Just good 
len ratingfive Why complain 
len ratingfive Yes

len ratingfive I am serious it is a good way to save important documents like resumes
len ratingfive Integrated with all Google apps this seamlessly works to keep track of all pertinent information 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is easy to use and very convenient 
len ratingfive I can use any device anywhere without issues 
len ratingfour  No issues or latency so far
len ratingfive It works

len ratingfive  which later on can be attached to calendar url for reminders 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfour I use the app all the time 
len ratingfour As a college student I m constantly saving and printing out files 
len ratingfour Google drive helps keep my organized 
len ratingfour I only gave it stars because it won t let me print from my phone 
len ratingfour Apart from that the app is clean and easy to navigate 
len ratingfive This app is so useful for so many reasons 
len ratingfive I can switch between my personal account and my school account easily 
len ratingfive It can hold things other than google files MP videos etc 
len ratingfive It is easy to access your files from the app 
len ratingone  Freezes every f ing time I open it 
len ratingone Have all my photos and video files on there almost so it is slowing down my work 
len ratingone This might be the reason I stop using google for anything
len ratingfive  Works well with IOS and Windows
len ratingfive  Awesome app and getting better 
len ratingfive Loving it so far
len ratingfive The best and getting better 
len ratingfour App is almost perfect 
len ratingfour Good native file viewing seamless transition between phone and desktop 
len ratingfour Easy to navigate 
len ratingfour I ve had a few issues trying to share my drive with others 
len ratingfour Sometimes they can t see certain files or they can t properly import it to their drive
len ratingfive Ridiculously easy to use whether it s uploading pictures or writing essays 
len ratingfive The ability to print from my phone is absolutely amazing
len ratingfive It integrates well with the Docs and Sheets apps too 
len ratingfive This is possibly the mat useful free app I have 
len ratingfive More useful than many I ve pad for 
len ratingfive As an entrepreneur I can t imagine sharing content and files in a more flexible platform than drive 
len ratingfive The setbacks are that you can not grab files from documents so easily and that you need multiple apps all free to get the full effect of the desktop drive database 
len ratingfive  Seen it all through all its transformation updates 
len ratingfive It s Awesome nowadays 
len ratingone I m very disappointed with google on this one 
len ratingone You would think a company like google would have this problem fixed 
len ratingone In my business I have PDF applications that clients fill out 
len ratingone When I save the filled out PDF to google drive a lot of times it saves it BLANK 
len ratingone If you log in the online version you can still see the clients writing but unfortunately on the App sometimes it saves the PDF blank 
len ratingone Google needs to fix this issue 
len ratingone I will start using Dropbox until the issue is fixed 
len ratingfive  I use it on a daily basis 
len ratingfive It makes being a student so easy with quick and easy sharing files with large groups of people having access to your files wherever you are granted your have Internet 
len ratingfive  and best of all easy to use with notability 
len ratingfive All praise be to google drive 
len ratingfive Now if they made it easier to jump back and forth accounts however 
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive So helpful and has a lot of room for all of my note lectures and course work 
len ratingfive  I love drive and the amount of free space it gives it s user 
len ratingfive Great app for iPhone ore any other platform

len ratingfive  Google Drive is a great app 
len ratingfive Reliable versatile and simple 
len ratingfive It s a vital productivity and collaboration tool for my business 
len ratingfive Works exactly as it should infinitely useful in combination with the desktop version 
len ratingfive  Using my Drive on my iPhone is amazing 
len ratingfive I can access and edit my documents anywhere even when I don t have wireless access 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingthree I wish that on my MP files it remembered where I left off 
len ratingtwo  The features available on android need to be available on Apple as well 
len ratingtwo Overall universal functionality has its challenges but that s somewhat unexpected from Google 
len ratingfive Snsg
len ratingfour I usually don t use cloud storage for files but google drive is very helpful when on the go and have to update my resume 
len ratingfour I just access a computer and download my resume edit it print it out and then upload it 
len ratingfour I don t have to carry a flash drive all the time 
len ratingfour It is also helpful when taking notes on things or for a secondary or tertiary backup of my poetry short stories and general journal I do 
len ratingfour I rarely use this particular app often on my iPad mini but the things I have there has not been major issues 
len ratingfour The only issue might be the limitation of file size that will upload but many apps that are not ftp apps have this issue so I am not sweating it 
len ratingfour Overall it does want I need 
len ratingone  Google Drive won t save upload edited images done in iOS Photo App or Snapseed 
len ratingone It renames all images to one name FullSizeRender jpg and not original name 
len ratingone So you have all images with the same name and lost all edits done 
len ratingone Not good Google 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is reliable and it allows me to take almost GB of my content to anywhere I travel in the world 
len ratingfive It saves me the hassle of taking my Hard Drives 
len ratingfive I hope in the future they make it possible to play and skip your music store on the drive without going back an forth to change song 
len ratingfive This is my only gripe with the app 
len ratingfive  Cloud drive is the best 
len ratingfive I can easily access my photos and documents from all my devices or on a shared device 
len ratingfive  This is great for storing photos and accessing documents that I did on my computer 
len ratingfive Also great for school I wouldn t be able to turn some files in without this app 
len ratingfour  good
len ratingfive  I can go anywhere in the world and ha e access to all my files 
len ratingfive Google drive is so useful for everything from personal data storage business communication collaboration anything really

len ratingfive I don t have to save anything to flash drives anymore 
len ratingfive You can make different folders to organize things and upload pictures from your device 
len ratingfive I use it all the time for projects or other schoolwork 
len ratingfive I definitely recommend it for anyone especially students wishing to keep their work all in one place 
len ratingfour  Ok a year later and this is still very very good possibly the best for both iOS and Windows 
len ratingfour Fast and reliable and additional storage space is both flexible and reasonably priced 
len ratingfour This is really an essential 
len ratingfour  This app is very well integrated across platforms and other Google apps 
len ratingfour It is solid dependable and as private as any cloud storage i e not very 
len ratingfour You should consider a third party encryption program for any sensitive data you store here 
len ratingfour Unlike iCloud GDrive allows full access to all files on your cloud drive making file mgmt possible and very easy 
len ratingfour Apple should take a lesson here 
len ratingfour Hope to win 
len ratingfive  Versatile as it gets 
len ratingfive Some boo boo s on the sharing multiple raw video files from camera BUT not positive it s a Drive issue 
len ratingfive And on demand 
len ratingfive  Of the many options I ve used I find Google s to be the most reliable platform and among the simplest to use 
len ratingfive The one flaw to the iPhone is limited storage 
len ratingfive With this app you can take as many pictures as you like and not clog up your phone 
len ratingfive It s easy and effortless 
len ratingfive  Great ap
len ratingfive  Get it you won t regret it 
len ratingfour  Drive is my go to cloud storage device 
len ratingfour Price reliability and cross platform operability is everything anyone could want

len ratingfive Love 
len ratingfive Amazing Google offers for free what Box charges for and does a worse job of delivering
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Functionality and portability make life easy Not having to carry or travel with jump drives is the best 
len ratingfour  Awesome application
len ratingfive  Google Drive makes accessing my files while on the go so so easy 
len ratingfive On iOS and on my desktop and laptop computers it is always available and so simple to share and collaborate with others 
len ratingfour  Good
len ratingfive  Useful app helps me read my larger files books when I dont have internet connection 
len ratingfive Also as a way to share videos with my friends 
len ratingone  You would think that Google would be coherent and allow it own app to chromecast it doesnt 
len ratingone This makes it useless to me 
len ratingone Icloud apple tv is the way to cast videos from the cloud 
len ratingfive  Never had an issue

len ratingfour  Especially Google photos 
len ratingfour It has cleared up a TON of space on my phone 
len ratingfour Really useful for docs and photos 
len ratingfour However I do wish that when you create a folder and you put content in them that content would only show in the folder 
len ratingfour Other than that terrific UI 
len ratingfour My school had us start using google drive and other google apps and I love it 
len ratingfour I know that I can always access my documents and other files and it s very easy to use

len ratingone This app is awful 
len ratingone I would rate out but that s not an option 
len ratingone It doesn t work

len ratingfive Awesome app to access google files 
len ratingfive  It has saved me many times by providing access to my important documents while on the go

len ratingfive I have used it for pictures histories and audio files 
len ratingfive Would hard to not have it now 
len ratingone  There s no support for images in the RAW file type 
len ratingone I use Drive to store all of my photos on and because I do not have a computer I rely on my phone to edit my pictures 
len ratingone There are tons of apps such as VSCO that support RAW file editing and iOS has made it much easier to but Drive simply can t yet and it takes almost all of the use out of the app 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingone You cannot even export a RAW photo out of Drive and into another editing app which was previously possible Drive is basically useless to me now

len ratingfive Google Drive is now my master storage for photos and other files which I can share with my family and friends 
len ratingfour  Works great and keeps everything organized
len ratingone Quick Access has ruined a perfectly good app 
len ratingone Useless and extremely annoying clutter in what was a very good online document storage app 
len ratingone If they provide a setting to disable it I will give them a stars 
len ratingone If they don t I will simply delete the app and stop using Google Drive 
len ratingone There are other solutions without such a mess added to the interface 
len ratingone  This app needs many improvements

len ratingfour  I love Google Drive 
len ratingfour It stands tall among all its rivals Dropbox OneNote etc 
len ratingfour  but the only downside is that I wish it had more storage

len ratingfive This takes this from a commodity space and makes it more unique 
len ratingfive Just like in real estate the key is location location location 
len ratingone Horrible
len ratingthree Ever since this past update I have been unable to open any of my documents 
len ratingthree Not sure if it s you guys or the iOS update that did it

len ratingfive Works as it should
len ratingfive I mean it s great and completely reliable
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I can t upload photos videos excel sheets word documents PDF docs voice recordings from emails what s app messages phone etc 
len ratingfive Just like any other app or game you have to play around with it to learn how to use it properly 
len ratingfive The app may not be as easy to maneuver through as compared to a computer but it s here for convince and accessibility 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google drive for years 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive  Love Google Drive 
len ratingfive I could not work without it 
len ratingone For over about a month the app has not worked for me 
len ratingone The most recent update fixed nothing 
len ratingfour  Nice
len ratingfive Love PDF option
len ratingfive  Works for files and photos which is super necessary if you tend to take tons of photos on a trip 
len ratingone It s so slow 
len ratingone And it doesn t show previews
len ratingfour Drive is perfect for saving photos and videos and the great part is that you can get all your photos on any smart phone or tab once downloaded 
len ratingfour Great convenience 
len ratingthree So all around great service but it will not let me export epub or mobi files to iBooks 
len ratingone It s pretty inconvenient when I m trying to load a file either my drive or shared with me and every single time it tells me the file can t be opened

len ratingfive People get a free product and then want to bash it 
len ratingfive This storage works great and I highly recommend it 
len ratingfive  All my google service needs in one place 
len ratingfive It s easy and efficient 
len ratingfive  I write a lot and work from home sometimes so I love having all my files in Google Drive to access from any device 
len ratingfive The app works well loads quickly and I have not any issues 
len ratingfour  Exactly what title says gifs only show the image also ALLOW USE TO REMOVE QUICK ACCESS
len ratingfive  Don t know what I would without it I can access it from anywhere 
len ratingone Google Drive is just not as good as other services like Dropbox or OneDrive 
len ratingone The other services have been releasing new features way more frequently than Google Drive 
len ratingone Google Drive s last major significant feature update was ages ago 
len ratingfour this app is super convenient 
len ratingfour Sometimes however when attempting to save a photo to my device it doesn t save properly 
len ratingfour I usually end up having to go back just screenshot the photo which screws up the quality 
len ratingone  Every time I ve tried to use my google drive app in the past week it is frozen and won t react to anything I can see all my folders but I can t select anything
len ratingfive Always with me wherever I go 
len ratingfive Google Apps are great and require no purchases of software 
len ratingfive  I have been using this type of app for a while but there is not one that nears the ease of use of this one 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree  Would be my perfect app to go with all my Google products except for the download is way too large for my small iPhone 
len ratingfive  Amazing what Google offers free 
len ratingfive This is so useful and helpful use on across any device and share with others too

len ratingfive Easy to figure out also 
len ratingfive Very straight forward 
len ratingfive Adding to my review now cool to know I can 
len ratingfive So grateful to have this free file aid to access all kinds of ways 
len ratingfive Using right now w Docscan app on iPhone super to take pic of paper doc convert to PDF save in Google Drive 
len ratingfive  You should try this application right away 
len ratingfive  Dung luong luu tru qua nhieu toi hoan toan thich server dat tai asian chay rat tot toi chua he thay bat ki loi nao dang khen
len ratingfive  It s on my phone my iPad windows laptop and chrome book 
len ratingfive If none of these are available swing by any library 
len ratingfive My files everywhere 
len ratingfive Most useful program
len ratingfive  Upload and download varies depending on which country you re in 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfour  Quick Access feature needs an option to turn it off 
len ratingfour Some items I save are confidential and shouldn t be displayed for anyone who might be looking over my shoulder when I open the app 
len ratingfour Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingfour It s the one glaring fault in an otherwise very useful app 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone  So much time wasted 
len ratingone It takes forever to be able to view photos 
len ratingone At one time you had to make available offline individually in order to view a photo 
len ratingone Then you could select all to make available offline 
len ratingone But they are not 
len ratingone You have to remove offline availability then make available offline takes forever 
len ratingone But there is a solution to this 
len ratingone You must individually hit option to view 
len ratingone It s ridiculously time consuming Now I cannot view any files that were made available offline Either way I don t understand why a photo that I took would require online availability to view a photo taken from my phone 
len ratingone It will occasionally suggest no internet connection 
len ratingone It s a photo 
len ratingone There is no url 
len ratingone I m not looking to view a photo by backtracking to its original source 
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingfive Thanks for making great products Google team 
len ratingfour I like google drive it is a great app
len ratingfive  You absolutely cannot beat Drive for price and functionality 
len ratingone With the arrival of the quick access bare the app is now unresponsive for a good fifteen seconds after launch 
len ratingone All of that delay for a completely unwanted feature 
len ratingone I ve actually started using my Dropbox account more often because of this 
len ratingfive Just get or don t it s great so yeah 
len ratingfive  I use it all of the time to move audio video files to multiple projects that need to be accessed from different computers 
len ratingfive Often more reliable than DropBox 
len ratingfour  Good tool
len ratingfive  Perfect for the on the go user that needs access to stored data 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive  Having an app version has been a life saver for needed last minute assignment check ups and alterations 
len ratingfive It s very well laid out and organized so it s easy to use 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingthree  Used to be great can t even use it now 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is fantastic 
len ratingfive I store all of my data on it 
len ratingfive Audiobooks music movies documents everything 
len ratingfive I can access those files at anytime 
len ratingfive It is nice to listen to my large audiobooks without them taking up room on my phone 
len ratingfive At the very least everyone should be backing up their data to a cloud storage system and I believe that Google provides an excellent service 
len ratingfive  i love it google drive i hope google improve app more and increase capacity for free
len ratingfive  Is pre y gud
len ratingone  The most annoying and retarded feature 
len ratingone Can t disable it 
len ratingone So anyone who happens to grab my phone is going to see sensitive info at easy access enticing them basically 
len ratingone You idiots 
len ratingone Can t save images or files to your phone either 
len ratingfive  Google Drive has given me a reason to get up in the morning 
len ratingfive I love organizing and this is truly the best experience for school work or actual work 
len ratingfive I have found that it is so easy to work with and truly an amazing organization 
len ratingtwo On March developers mentioned Photo and video uploads are now more reliable and up to times faster but they forgot to mention the ANNOYING Quick Access tab on the top of the application interface that never goes away 
len ratingtwo They did not respect people s preferences and put it as an optional feature that could be turned off from the settings 
len ratingtwo Rather they assumed that EVERY SINGLE user would love a bugging tap on the top of their files 
len ratingtwo PLEASE REMOVE IT or make it optional 
len ratingtwo It is really annoying 
len ratingfive This is really helpful because i can put all my pictures so i can get storage in my phone
len ratingfive  good app
len ratingfive Not a fan of cloud and not a fan of drop box 
len ratingfive Since I have a google account that access email YouTube and storage is a no brainer
len ratingfive  I love it 
len ratingfive  Thanks to the masters developers
len ratingfive Love it so easy to use
len ratingfive  the best drive app wooow
len ratingfour This app is great but keeps freezing up on the home screen when I open it so I am unable to see my files 
len ratingfour Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingfour  Perfect fast and rely reliable works flawless and uploading files is rely easy love it 
len ratingfive Can t live without Drive nowadays
len ratingfive  offline mode needs to be improved support all video formats such as mkv 
len ratingfive love it anyways 
len ratingfive google please keep improving
len ratingfive The Drive app provides a great ease of use stability portability security and the peace of mind that the data is safe and crash proof 
len ratingfive Initially I liked Dropbox better but got got suckered by the GB free versus the Dropbox s GB 
len ratingfive But now I am paying and using the GB plan from google 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app 
len ratingfive One of the best online storage around 
len ratingfive Can depend on Google for almost anything 
len ratingfour  I like the Google ecosystem I use Gmail Drive Voice and more but Drive does not sync fast enough sometimes it takes a great while 
len ratingfour Moreover OSX tags don t come over on the sync 
len ratingfour Also unlike Dropbox there s no way I could figure short of pausing quitting the app then resuming restarting to sync on the fly 
len ratingfour Frustrating 
len ratingfive  Really like editing and tweaking stuff on my iPad 
len ratingfive Certain functions like editing a web link isn t available in the iPad version yet 
len ratingfive Straight Drive functionality is nice 
len ratingfive Really miss right click functionality though 
len ratingfive Wish developers would understand how important that is to file actions 
len ratingfive  S per 
len ratingfive If you value your files use Google Drive 
len ratingfive You ll be sorry if you don t back up your stuff 
len ratingfive Do it 
len ratingfive  Like a pro
len ratingfive  As a kid the first TV we got with a remote control I knew I would never go back 
len ratingfive Same feeling with Google Drive 
len ratingfive Full functionality and access from anywhere in the world Im never going back 
len ratingfive  Love my Google Drive 
len ratingone  Eh
len ratingone Doesn t give options to save photos to phone
len ratingthree Love love google drive except with the new update the quick access rendering on the screen locks the display until the rendering is done 
len ratingthree I don t even want quick access but can t hide it so now it takes a good secs before I can search or open something 
len ratingthree Please allow the user to hide quick access 
len ratingfive  Good job Google 
len ratingfive Easy to use cloud storage and it is now being integrated into various platforms including applications on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Very useful 
len ratingfive  Google is the best 
len ratingfive  Hands down the best app for synchronized multi editing 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive to manage all types of documents for both of my jobs and home life 
len ratingfive Google Drive gives me the ability to edit spreadsheets and other important docs with my business partner from the opposite side of the world in real time save all of that information in the cloud in organized folders and I can save anything I need to my phone or tablet for easy access on the go 
len ratingfive I use the drive at home to keep up with important household docs 
len ratingfive Being able to access certain paperwork when away from the house has saved me lots of time 
len ratingfive Having so much information centrally located and being able to access it all from anyway is amazing 
len ratingfive And you get it all with your FREE email account 
len ratingfive Who else is providing this type of service 
len ratingfive I haven t even touched on G Suites 
len ratingfive If you re a small business owner and you re not using this Google product then you re either paying someone else too much or your loosing out on an unmatched opportunity 
len ratingfive I can transfer so much everywhere it s so great especially for a videography enthusiast like me 
len ratingfive Google drive is awesome 
len ratingfive This app is so easy to use and Google Drive has lots of free space with reasonable rates for more 
len ratingfive A great plus many iOS apps work nicely with Google Drive 
len ratingfive It is my go to cloud system for any of my important files 
len ratingfive  Great functionality trusted application feature rich

len ratingfive It s great
len ratingfive Is a good tool for the day by day 
len ratingfive I keep all of our family documents of all types in Drive and Drive is mirrored and synced to my Macs

len ratingfive It s so easy to use and convenient

len ratingfive within this app and it doesn t matter where I log into I still retrieve my latest document 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Drive team 
len ratingfour Google Drive really fills a need 
len ratingfour There are lots of players in this field 
len ratingfour Google is at or near the best 
len ratingfour It handles most file types for most platforms very well 
len ratingfour The Apple iOS implementation is not up to the level of Android or Windows 
len ratingfour It doesn t handle MS Word document format quite as well 
len ratingfive  This is a really useful app 
len ratingfive Have tried and compared with several of the other cloud storage services and found this to be easy and very user friendly 
len ratingfive Although I don t store a great amount there I find that this really meets my needs 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive  Really enjoy this site
len ratingfive  Works well
len ratingfive Good accessible app 
len ratingfive  So much more user friendly than the others 
len ratingfive Love the ability to collaborate and go to any computer and open documents 
len ratingfive Love the real time accessibility 
len ratingfive Would love to see stronger power point type app 
len ratingone  The most annoying and retarded feature 
len ratingone Can t disable it 
len ratingone So anyone who happens to grab my phone is going to see sensitive info at easy access enticing them basically 
len ratingone You idiots 
len ratingfive I like the app a lot and really enjoy the fact that I can use my fingerprint to log in 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive Great app

len ratingfive The files that I need 
len ratingfive On hand 
len ratingfive  Love drive

len ratingfive  This app has made my life so much more simple between work and home because I have access to my files and can work on them anywhere with or without a computer 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive  An amazing app for storage on all your devices 
len ratingfive  Absolutely great use in my classroom and share with my students 
len ratingfive Helps when kids are absent
len ratingfive Hooked on Google Drive 
len ratingfive Who knew 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It holds all my important files and it s easy to transfer from one device to another 
len ratingone  This update brought back years of deleted files as recents the remove option does not work 
len ratingone Quick view can not be disabled 
len ratingone Updating app was big mistake 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive we ve come a long way since the megabyte computers that took us to the moon in the s
len ratingone  Instead of simply asking users whether they want to rate review the app or of course doing nothing at all Google has added an interstitial dialog box 
len ratingone It prompts users whether they like the app or not then sends positive feedback to the App Store and redirects negative feedback to Google where it goes to die 
len ratingone As a result of this intentionally disingenuous UI the ratings here are skewed higher than users actual experiences 
len ratingfive Convenient
len ratingtwo One folder of huge size if tagges as available offline then there is no way to turn off available offline 
len ratingtwo Also there should be option of downloading it only via wifi 
len ratingfive I was told that I needed to get an IPhone above gb because the space would run out too fast 
len ratingfive All I have to do is upload photos videos and music files to my drive and now I have more space on my phone 
len ratingfive Hahahaha 
len ratingfive How you like them apples 
len ratingfive Good interface and awesome file previews 
len ratingfive Stores my notes etc 
len ratingfive that I can easily edit from anywhere since it synchs with google 
len ratingfive Get google docs 
len ratingfive It s like having MS word 
len ratingfive  I m so happy I can now access google drive on my phone so I can take my important docs with me anywhere 
len ratingfive I have also figured out how to use the same functions on my phone like how I use it on my desktop 
len ratingfive  Perfect
len ratingfive  Perfect way to store your audios and files 
len ratingfour  This app is great for storage backup and collaboration 
len ratingfour It is missing the ability to markup PDF documents 
len ratingfive  I need it 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Store all my pdfs on google drive and easy to quickly access on my iPhone and iPad 
len ratingfive This App is one of the Best that I have used 
len ratingfour  I love this app I think the storage should be more than GB so my only recommendation would be to increase the storage 
len ratingfive  If you don t have it get it 
len ratingfive Hands down one of the top best apps on my phone 
len ratingfour  Does what it s supposed to do my only problem is it doesn t let you navigate pages like the iBook does 
len ratingfive Very convenient 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I like the ability to access documents across platforms tablets PCs Mac OS etc 
len ratingfive I rated it stars and would like to see the option to view shared folders in a list 
len ratingfive I use it for any document I need to get to wherever I m at 
len ratingfive Also using google cloud print is excellent for when I need something printed and don t want to forget to print it later 
len ratingtwo The app works fine when it doesn t automatically crash on me 
len ratingtwo It usually happens when I let it load all the way 
len ratingtwo Then when I try to export a video or photo I can t tell if it isn t working or if it s just taking a long time 
len ratingfive  Me gusta mucho el app
len ratingfive Great App for photos and converting documents to accessible formats to opening JPG s PDF s etc 
len ratingfive for Mac s and other devices

len ratingfive Indispensable 
len ratingfive It s awesome and I love this app
len ratingfive Drive has made my life soooo much easier 
len ratingfive This is an awesome app 
len ratingfive Works well on all of my Google and Apple devices 
len ratingfive For the price and features Google Drive is the best cloud based storage app I have used 
len ratingfive I recently traded in a Samsung Galaxy Note for an iPhone Plus and the first thing I did was turn off Siri and install Google Drive and Google productivity apps like Sheets 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this software

len ratingfive  Much better experience and faster than previous releases

len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour I use it for all my stuff 
len ratingfour Best price for storage and features 
len ratingfour New ability to select and move multiple items is great 
len ratingfour Switching between apps to be able to edit docs is annoying but everyone else is doing the same thing and has for years Like Microsoft and Apple just saying 
len ratingfour I would love it if I could view my google docs within the app and then open them in the other apps when I wanted to edit That would make this stars to me 
len ratingone  I don t need the quick access feature 
len ratingone It is ridiculous the there is no option to turn it off 
len ratingone There is an obvious reason for using folders 
len ratingone I don t want to see my latest porn popping up on my front page during a meeting 
len ratingfive Google drive is a great tool and the app is integrated perfectly with iOS
len ratingfour I have found my drive an excellent area to store documents and have access from any of my channels from anywhere 
len ratingfour An option that provides a secure and portable way to have access to your data

len ratingfive  Easy to use great access anywhere 
len ratingfive  Pretty easy UI speedy even in iOS 
len ratingfive Easy transfers and downloads

len ratingone  f ck
len ratingthree Works great for uploading backing up some files but loading thumbnails for pictures or videos load way too long making it hard to see which picture to save
len ratingfive  Thanks for the development
len ratingfive Easy to use from any location on any device 
len ratingfive  Have had no problems when using Drive whether it s from a browser or my devices the behavior is exactly the same and that is much appreciated 
len ratingfive  Tream drive is very good 
len ratingfive Google has done it once again 
len ratingfive Lightweight yet trustworthy and secure 
len ratingfive I store important personal and business information in this baby Google I put my faith in you to stay on your A game vis a vis privacy and reliability 
len ratingfive  Best file sharing platform ever

len ratingfive makes school so much easier
len ratingfive This product is in incredible it s also the best I ve seen 
len ratingfive  Easily managed multiple drives with ease on my phone 
len ratingfive Priceless 
len ratingfour  The only problem I have is that it does not updated in real time as far as account information and usage information 
len ratingfive  The rate at which it improves the breadth of functionality and the accessibility of Drive is almost unparalleled in one single software environment 
len ratingfive There are a few things Google can do to enhance some of the overall features of docs sheets drawings etc 
len ratingfive  i e 
len ratingfive make it as robust as MS Office products but it s pretty phenomenal for free software 
len ratingfive Heck I d pay for an upgraded version without question 
len ratingone  I can t even work it by far the worst I ve ever had 
len ratingone Bing is better
len ratingfive  I find Google Drive extremely easy to use 
len ratingfive I ve downloaded PDF files for use later created shared docs spreadsheets forms with others and compiled survey results etc 
len ratingfive with ease

len ratingfive Gmail Google Drive and Google Voice are a winning combination for me 
len ratingfive Simply awesome 
len ratingfive Easy to use good file sharing quick uploads and downloads very easy organizing files and I love the associated google apps 
len ratingfive Google sheets has some compatibility issues with formulas in excel spreadsheets 
len ratingfive The formulas do not work when an excel file is opened using google sheets 
len ratingfive Cloud print is cool but sometimes i loose connection with the printer even when the status shown is connected 
len ratingfive When using google docs or google sheets after selecting the print function the dialog box does not list the printers 
len ratingfive When I select the change device button the cloud ready connected printers do not show up 
len ratingfive Sometime the print function works and other times it doesn t it s frustrating sometimes 
len ratingfive Overall google drive is awesome 
len ratingone They need to add a setting that allows you to turn off the quick access tool bar 
len ratingfive  This app is very helpful to keep things organized 
len ratingfour  The latest update has file preview tiles for recently accessed files 
len ratingfour The problem the tiles show images of the file contents and launch them even if the files are in password protected folders 
len ratingfour Big flaw 
len ratingfive It s fantastic being able to access and share files from so many devices 
len ratingfive Getting work work done on the go is great with its sister apps like Docs Slides and sheets 
len ratingfive They make collaborating so easy 
len ratingfive  File hoarders dream 
len ratingfive Keep it all

len ratingfive  Google Drive is pretty much the best collaborative tool on the internet 
len ratingfive It lets you get live feedback from co workers on the same document as you edit on the document as well 
len ratingfive It offers up to GB of storage more than enough for an average worker 
len ratingfive It s one of the best places to safely store information and to make Google Documents Google Slides Google Charts and Google Surveys 
len ratingfive It s a brilliant tool a d I m sure it will not let you down 
len ratingfive  I am very happy with this app 
len ratingfive This allows me the opportunity to capture more precious moments in the moment 
len ratingfour If it was integrated with more iOS audio apps it would be perfect 
len ratingfour Just for my uses 
len ratingfour Otherwise fabulous and easy to use 
len ratingfive This app is really useful

len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive  it is very fast and useful
len ratingfive Nice app 
len ratingfive  I it I use it every day
len ratingtwo  I loved Google Drive until they added Quick Access without anyway to control or hide it 
len ratingtwo I have files and pictures that I don t want people looking over my shoulder to see 
len ratingtwo Nothing naughty but private 
len ratingtwo I keep these things in folders 
len ratingtwo There is no way to hide this feature or control what is shown 
len ratingtwo I ll jump back to five stars if Google gives us more control over what is shown or better yet to hide it all 
len ratingfive From day one I have loved using Google Drive 
len ratingfive It s easy to set up 
len ratingfive It s easy to use 
len ratingfive I drag files into the thing and they are there 
len ratingfive No delay 
len ratingfive No hassle 
len ratingfive I ve used Apple iCloud and it s ok 
len ratingfive But I couldn t figure out how the desktop app works 
len ratingfive With Dive it is plain and simple 
len ratingfive Google Drive is absolutely terrific 
len ratingfive Forget the others 
len ratingfive Just start with the best 
len ratingfive Oh by the way additional cloud storage is cheaper with Google 
len ratingfour I enjoy having one place where I can get it at all my documents 
len ratingfour Would love it if there were a desktop loaded app to edit the documents and make it more user friendly 
len ratingfive I ve used Drive for years and I ve never had a problem with it 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive  I love the way you can work together on a project or just share stuff with friends and family 
len ratingfour Critical to the success of any company is being on the right side of policies otherwise they will sensor and mitigate the effects of good policies for its customers 
len ratingfour Does google stand behind the rest of the American people 
len ratingtwo While Quick Access may be a cool feature with this release can you give us the option to enable it ourselves 
len ratingtwo If you view a file picture that you keep as private quick access automatically shows it thus defeating the purpose of it being kept as private 
len ratingtwo Please look into this 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive  Definitely helps with school and organization for other business
len ratingone You can t disable the quick access option 
len ratingone It has files that have been deleted that I have no use for but I still see them at the very top of my screen every time 
len ratingone I m deleting the app until an update gives me an option to have it or not or at least allows us to modify the view to not see it 
len ratingthree  The Google Photos app does this why not the Google Drive app where I have Google Photos take all my photos from 
len ratingthree I do it that way because there s no offline Google Photos app for Windows which there should in the store 
len ratingfive  Google Drive changes lives 
len ratingfive All my businesses and now strategic partners are using Drive across continents

len ratingfive Everything I need in one place 
len ratingfive It doesn t get better than that

len ratingfive I like that I can access documents quickly across any device and work manipulate or even share with others

len ratingfive That s all 
len ratingfive  Works way better than Dropbox in my opinion 
len ratingfive Very user friendly and easy to share documents between groups for projects 
len ratingfour Good
len ratingone Please not everyone wants to show their recent uploaded files at the first line

len ratingone Especially the new version

len ratingfive Love the app
len ratingfive I like the most the way you can attach files to your email through google drive
len ratingfive  Great app Enjoy it 
len ratingfive  This app works just great when I need to save an unforgettable moment in time 
len ratingfive Everything is all right there when I need it 
len ratingfour I really do love the whole idea of it 
len ratingfour Just one minor thing the quick access 
len ratingfour That s now starting to get annoying especially since I m not used to it 
len ratingfour I think you should add a switch for that 
len ratingfour By that I mean that we can either enable or disable it 
len ratingfour  Another small thing is the
len ratingfive Google drive rocks 
len ratingfive This is one of the most useful apps I have 
len ratingfive It integrates seamlessly with my computer and I can view and edit all of my files 
len ratingfive  Can t live without it 
len ratingfour Drive holds my documents my art my files and is fast and convenient for when I m on the go

len ratingfive This is the best cloud storage platform that I have used among others 
len ratingfive What make it special is its seamless integration of google drive between mobile desktop and browser mode

len ratingfive Only shortcoming I see is it take little longer to content integrate desktop version with online
len ratingone it doesnt even turn the car on
len ratingfive  I m very satisfied with Google Drive

len ratingfour How do I sync edits or a new file from my PC to my iPhone 
len ratingone This was a great app until they recently forced the Quick Access view at the top of the window 
len ratingone The Android version has an option to disable it 
len ratingone Why doesn t the iOS version 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Hasn t let me down yet 
len ratingfive Thanks google
len ratingtwo  What s annoying is that you need to download multiple apps connected to google google docs google sides etc 
len ratingtwo to do all the work you want to do that you could otherwise normally do online on a computer all on one platform 
len ratingfive Drive is reliable and fast and always there when I need it 
len ratingfive Love the ease of using with other software applications 
len ratingfive Definitely recommended 
len ratingfive  Looks like fun as soon as I can figure out how to use it 
len ratingfive Considering that Google already runs the Internet I think it s about the safest bet in terms of longevity for a Cloud storage app 
len ratingfive I have never had cause to doubt the security of my Google account plus it s free and fairly polished 
len ratingfive Thanks Alphabet 
len ratingfour The more I use it the more comfortable and familiar I become 
len ratingfour Easy to create folders and sharing and downloading 
len ratingfour Having to edit a document when using different computers or mobile device is so easy 
len ratingfive  I can t post memes from my computer I can t make memes on my phone this connects them so it all works out plus it helps clear your camera roll to save space on your phone as well as makes the sharing of files for a game a group of my friends are making for a school club

len ratingfive  Exactly what I was looking for 
len ratingfive Freaking awesome that Google put this together 
len ratingfive We have been using for years and never had issues with it 
len ratingfive All of our staff has access to our material work schedule documents etc

len ratingfive Like everything else Goggle it s better than a tool like Dropbox because it s integrated with a suite of useful apps 
len ratingfive It s accessible on my desktop tablet and phone so it s every where I need it to be 
len ratingfive I love Drive and you will too

len ratingfive you just find your file on your phone and upload it it has been a LIFE SAVER 
len ratingfive  So convenient to have files in one place and accessible from cell phone iPad and computer 
len ratingfive  Google Drive and all things Google are wonderful and allow me to use my phone and the cloud the way I no longer even assume Apple would equip its thousand dollar creditor cell service provider scam with 
len ratingfive I don t know what Apple is doing when it comes to storage 
len ratingfive Wait 
len ratingfive Yes I do 
len ratingfive They don t do storage 
len ratingfive They hold your photos and everything digital hostage in some kind of bizarre backup system called i Cloud 
len ratingfive A must app to have 
len ratingfive Very handy and it has many features 
len ratingfive Totally great for storage 
len ratingfive  I love using the google drive 
len ratingfive I m able to manage all my files and know exactly where everything is 
len ratingfive I m able to access the files on all my devices phone tablet and desktop 
len ratingfive One of the many ways I use the app I moved all my recipe files to the drive

len ratingfour But still sometimes has hard time when multiple people are working on Microsoft products
len ratingfive  Never lose anything
len ratingfive  Could not as easily collaborate without it 
len ratingfour  Everything was great until they added quick access 
len ratingfour Wish we had the option to disable

len ratingfive  This app is awesome
len ratingfive  Freakin love it 
len ratingfive Super easy to store pictures and documents 
len ratingfive  This app is great for backing up all of my photos that I don t want to loose 
len ratingfive I hooked it up to my printer so now when I am at work I can just print something and it will be on my printer when I get home with the air print

len ratingfive Esta app es muy importante para mi rendimiento como emprendedor me permite tener todos mis documentos y archivos en diferentes dispositivos ya sea en Apple o android 
len ratingfour It s the best drive I have used till now 
len ratingfour Easily beats dropbox and other cloud storage applications 
len ratingfour But sometimes for some reason we cannot upload the pictures and the notification at the bottom freezes 
len ratingfour I explored everything in the application I tried deleting the folder I am uploading to I unchecked the access to my photos in settings 
len ratingfour Nothing stopped the upload from freezing 
len ratingfour I was disappointed with that 
len ratingfour Otherwise it would ve been a star application 
len ratingfour  Uninstalling the picture helped to fix the problem 
len ratingfive Been a fan for years

len ratingfive  Love it

len ratingfive  Google Drive has been saving my life in college as no other app could do 
len ratingfive I can simply share my stuff with anybody very quickly and it has put an end to all my pendrives 
len ratingfive And to get better if I despairingly need to edit create a doc or a presentation on my Iphone or iPad I can do it wherever I want and it will be in wherever I need it 
len ratingfive Google Drive just need the trash tab inside the app to recover the accidentally deleted files 
len ratingfive Besides that great work google 
len ratingfive  Works as it should 
len ratingfive No issues with it so far 
len ratingfour  This is really nice to have 
len ratingfour Google drive and docs are very helpful in school or just business wise 
len ratingfour I would definitely recommend this 
len ratingfour It s also easy to share document with others and put them in different folders 
len ratingfour Very organized 
len ratingfour  Pretty darn good 
len ratingfour Very handy 
len ratingfour Music files of ma type can be troublesome to exchange between iOS and android devices 
len ratingfive Easy to use for quick communication 
len ratingone  This app will wipe out your extended file metadata if you use it on a Mac 
len ratingone Some odd reviews in here iCloud storage is a better deal and if you use iCloud Photo Library your phone won t fill up 
len ratingone Save yourself a bunch of hassles and just go with Dropbox which works better has better apps and is more comparable with a wide variety of apps and services 
len ratingfive  Outstanding product
len ratingfive Great app very useful and available at the tip of your finger even offline 
len ratingfive This is amazing I just love it Make more apps google
len ratingfive I ve been using this from seemingly the beginning 
len ratingfive At first it was a bit frustrating because of the cross between google and apple but now this app has gotten so much better 
len ratingfive I can move pics files videos whatever back and forward with no problems 
len ratingfive Wonderful
len ratingfive Loving it FoHunnnid 
len ratingfive  There are only a handful of apps that make an appearance in my daily life and this is one of them 
len ratingfive Super easy and intuitive to use 
len ratingfive Love having my files available wherever I am 
len ratingfive I also love being able to share files and having the option for view only 
len ratingfive Fantastic app 
len ratingfive Every good thing this is I like a lot oh yes gimme more
len ratingfive  It s very easily classify into many category 
len ratingfive And that is very accessible 
len ratingfive I also stored music scores or favorite websites 
len ratingthree  I love this app mostly 
len ratingthree With the recent update quick access isn t for me and once the app is running quick access documents are open to anyone who can see my screen 
len ratingthree It would be great if there was a way to turn it off 
len ratingfive First sincere gratitude to my fellow reviewers who have enlightened the rest of us in all the possibilities of this app 
len ratingfive  Offline music who knew 
len ratingfive Second the more one pokes around the app the more one learns ways to make life simpler 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive every day 
len ratingfive I highly recommend it to the mobile professional 
len ratingfive It is remember working without constant access to your files from every device 
len ratingfour  Good tool for individual and team use
len ratingfour  Been using google drive for a while now and find it decent 
len ratingfour However it should be an easy two step procedure to rename uploaded files from an iOS device 
len ratingfour Dropbox and Apple s iCloud are easier at renaming uploads 
len ratingthree  The service and prices are great and it s generally easy to upload pictures 
len ratingthree However I began to notice some pictures I thought I had uploaded were missing 
len ratingthree I normally upload pictures in large groups of sometimes over at once and I noticed today of a set of photos that were missing 
len ratingthree I decide to do some tests to see if my suspicions were correct and they were 
len ratingthree When I uploaded everything was fine 
len ratingthree I tried and around were missing 
len ratingthree Very bothered at how many old pictures I thought were saved to the cloud are gone now and I ve just now realized it 
len ratingthree Stay safe and upload regularly 
len ratingthree Stay under pictures at a time 
len ratingfour  I really like this app because I store all my old pictures on Google Drive because my phone doesn t have enough storage 
len ratingfour I just wish that my pictures were easier to access 
len ratingfour If they were sorted by date similar to Memories for iPhotos it would be so much easier 
len ratingfour Great app would recommend 
len ratingone Please add the option to disable the recent files from appearing at the top of Google Drive 
len ratingone I have sensitive information that I don t want to be displayed on the home screen of the app for Christ s sake 
len ratingfive Chrome Drive is my favorite cloud drives and has one of the largest free storage 
len ratingfive I also like its integration with Sheets and Docs 
len ratingfive I wish they were all one app but I understand why multiple may be better 
len ratingfive Google Drive makes it easy to create edit and share files that can be accessed anywhere 
len ratingfive I use it at work to gather information on the factory floor and with my family to share recipe 
len ratingfour  How come there is no app for Google forms yet 
len ratingfive  AMAZING
len ratingfive I can save files to it easily 
len ratingfive Also can easily share files with anyone 
len ratingfive Use it weekly 
len ratingfive  This is awesome for sharing documents and things from my students 
len ratingone  Hate the forced Quick View that can t be disabled
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive It is very user friendly and helps me a ton to keep track of all my files and projects 
len ratingfive Plus I love it better than using notes on my phone because I know I will have access to the file even if I don t have my phone 
len ratingfive I can use my computer or someone else s computer to access all the things I need 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfour  Easy to use and it s great being able to access my files from any device 
len ratingfive Su te necess ria para quem lida com muitos arquivos 
len ratingfive Com boa integra o com programas de terceiros al m de ter o pr prio editor planilha pdf e apresenta o 
len ratingfive Funciona redondo com o gmail 
len ratingfive  So easy so fast and it s all on your fingertips 
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour I use it for all my stuff 
len ratingfour Best price for storage and features 
len ratingfour New ability to select and move multiple items is great 
len ratingfour Switching between apps to be able to edit docs is annoying but everyone else is doing the same thing and has for years Like Microsoft and Apple just saying 
len ratingfour I would love it if I could view my google docs within the app and then open them in the other apps when I wanted to edit That would make this stars to me 
len ratingfive I love my Google drive 
len ratingfive I love the app I love my gmail 
len ratingfive What more can I say 
len ratingfive I use all things Google on my iPhone and have disabled my iCloud and it has been a happy union thus far 
len ratingfive Yes everyone says Google spies on me for the government 
len ratingfive Yes it s extremely plausible 
len ratingfive Yes I think that is a terrible thing but it doesn t change the fact that I love the app and love that I don t need to worry about lost phones and contacts or pictures lost or crashed hard drives and data loss 
len ratingfive LOVE my Chromebook too 
len ratingfive Google drive stores all of my business documents 
len ratingfive Having them available anywhere I go is key 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive  I am very happy 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Drive
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingfive Google drive has really help me get more space on my iPad and save space on my s edge
len ratingfive  Use this all the time for group projects and planning events 
len ratingfive Easy to use and share documents and easily keep track of work 
len ratingfive The best drive ever
len ratingfive  A complete file system with perks that s available on all devices and online 
len ratingfive Yes please 
len ratingfive Reliable app 
len ratingfive Seamless integration with all devices 
len ratingfive It adds drive space and easily transfer files
len ratingone  It makes my iPhone overheat 
len ratingfive  I love my G Drive I can access my files wherever I am 
len ratingfive It has streamlined my life 
len ratingfive I don t really want the new Quick Access feature its taking up screen estate on my iPhone screen that I see as un useful for me at the moment and not to mention I m still seeing files through Quick Access that are in the trash which I believe to be an error or bug of some sort 
len ratingfive Please do give me the option to enable and disable the new Quick Access feature 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive I didn t even know this existed it s awesome
len ratingfive Good app 
len ratingfive Im like to 
len ratingfive  The best app to transfer media and files 
len ratingfive  I use it everyday for work and play 
len ratingfour  i love the app just i cant seem to put certain drives on certain apps
len ratingfive  I have had his app for a year and I couldn t ask for a better one 
len ratingfive All your files are in one place and you can organize however you like 
len ratingfive Everything is easily accessible and you are able to access anywhere 
len ratingfive You can even access documents offline as long as you check the box 
len ratingfive You shouldn t look any further if you are needing easy organized and up to date storage 
len ratingone Everything was great but now there s a stupid quick access thing at the top 
len ratingone It is in the way and pointless 
len ratingtwo  The File Provider extension support is incredibly buggy 
len ratingtwo Cannot open a file from another app make edits and have document saved back to original location 
len ratingtwo Trying to move documents from another app to Drive via File Provider extension is also buggy never finishes upload multiple copies created 
len ratingtwo Opening importing to Drive works fine but this leaves you with the original file in the sending app hence an unneeded duplicate 
len ratingtwo Please fix the bugs in your use of the File Provider and Document Provider ios extensions 
len ratingfive  This app is awesome and convenient 
len ratingfive  I ve been using Google Drive for a couple years now and I love it 
len ratingfive It works great and it s very user friendly 
len ratingfive I ve never had any issues or problems with it 
len ratingfive I ve tried other cloud services and I always come right back 
len ratingfive It s very easy to use and even accessible to those of us that aren t as tech minded as others 
len ratingfive My wife was looking for an easier more user friendly way of moving her photos from her iPhone and iPad to her laptop instead of using iTunes which is horrible and needs to be completely overhauled IMO 
len ratingfive So I told her about Google Drive and set it up on all of her devices 
len ratingfive After trying it out she likes it a lot and it s the only method she uses for moving her photos now 
len ratingfive Love the Google suite 
len ratingfive My only complaint is that I got all my eggs in one basket and I know on the backend they re using all my usage to drive ad sales 
len ratingfive But I guess you can t complain about free 
len ratingfive  Get this thing it works every time 
len ratingfive  Very easy to use and share docs 
len ratingfive Goes with you on any device and is incredibly easy to share with anyone 
len ratingfive Much easier than The Cloud iCloud Dropbox IMHO
len ratingfive I use it every day Have learned how to create my own worksheets Excellent 
len ratingfive  Great collaboration tool with convenient integrations 
len ratingfive This app has been seamless no matter where I am 
len ratingfive Everything is exactly where and when I need it 
len ratingfive Great for my business too 
len ratingfive I don t know how I would live without Drive 
len ratingfive Sounds a bit dramatic I understand 
len ratingfive Sure I could survive but what quality of life could there be without Drive s seamless integration with gmail and my other most used apps and ease of use for sharing and storage 
len ratingfive I use Dropbox and iCloud too S too come to think of it but none of those give me the joy I get from Drive 
len ratingfive I especially like not having to launch another app to view a doc watch a video or listen to an mp 
len ratingfive When sharing files like videos music and documents on gmail you can view them right in the window with the email without having to download it first 
len ratingfive Bored yet 
len ratingfive I could go on Get Drive you will soon wonder how you ever lived without it 
len ratingfour  I am very happy with this app 
len ratingfour I m able to store lots of files on it 
len ratingfour There s a lot of room and I have managed to get things easily organized 
len ratingfour It is not very difficult to move files to change their name or to share them which is nice 
len ratingfour Some problems I run into include weird temporary files taking over my folders 
len ratingfour This is something I run into outside of the app too 
len ratingfour Google Drive does this thing where it creates tons of temporary files when you open a file and clogs up your space 
len ratingfour This can make things very confusing when you re trying to sort through files on this app 
len ratingfour Also I accidentally deleted a bunch of pictures one time and didn t even realize it so I m very careful when I m on the app not to click things 
len ratingfour Dropbox is definitely preferred but there s not enough space on there for me to just use it 
len ratingfour Drive has met all my needs without too many issues 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive One of the best things on the internet 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive I use it to share stuff with my family 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Reliable storage application
len ratingfive What else can I say 
len ratingfive After trying Apples per month GB cloud storage service I was told and found out for myself that viewing videos and pics stored in iCloud would count against the storage on my iPhone 
len ratingfive In other words a GB photo video library would need AT LEAST a GB phone 
len ratingfive Ridiculous 
len ratingfive I have a GB phone 
len ratingfive Switched to Google Drive and uploaded my entire library 
len ratingfive Viewable on all devices and does NOT count against the storage on my phone 
len ratingfive Google you did it right 
len ratingfive  per month gets you GB and there s a discount if you pay for the entire year 
len ratingfive Am I slowly becoming a non Apple person 
len ratingfive Allows me to back up all my photos and videos without connecting to the computer 
len ratingfive When my phone says I m running out of space I just back everything up and I m good to go 
len ratingfive  Awesome app super efficient 
len ratingfive  Very good app and service 
len ratingfive  I have been using Google Drive for a long time and have never had any problems
len ratingtwo  Crash crash CRASHES when scrolling rapidly through PDFs 
len ratingtwo Even small mb files with only pages 
len ratingtwo Not able to markup or comment on files or fill out PDF forms 
len ratingfour I use this for group projects and it s great 
len ratingfour I can see all the updates immediately even when I m from my computer 
len ratingfour Not as user friendly as I d like so I only gave it stars 
len ratingfive On the go 
len ratingfive In the class 
len ratingfive At home 
len ratingfive All options are handy to have your files available 
len ratingfive Google made something here that makes life easier 
len ratingfive Period 
len ratingfive It helps me keep up with all my files sheets pictures and etc 
len ratingfive it s one of the only apps I won t delete to make space on my phone 
len ratingfive  Life saver

len ratingfive I love that I can access and edit documents from any of my devices 
len ratingfive My middle schooler is now using it for some class assignments and likes that she has access to her projects wherever she is 
len ratingfive Another Google home run 
len ratingfive Wish for gif playback support 
len ratingfive Or ability to open gifs on chrome or safari 
len ratingfive I love that I can save docs from my 
len ratingfive Computer and there they are on my phone 
len ratingfive Super overall amazing 
len ratingfive  All my files are with me with internet access 
len ratingfive But you can also view files offline by selecting the ones you want available

len ratingfour Its great app the problem I have though and this is also an issue with the web version but when you have numbers as the title of folders its doesn t organize them properly

len ratingfour That needs to be fixed 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive I use all the time it helps a lot to keep something important 
len ratingfive  The app works well use it all the time across platforms and devices 
len ratingfive Makes it really easy to have a virtual file cabinet to store files 
len ratingfour Great perk to having a Gmail account like a free Cloud it makes sharing content and collaborating with groups on written and visual content hassle free 
len ratingone All I want is to be able to share a photo from drive to an app 
len ratingone I do not want to have other people download an app drive

len ratingfive Stores a lot and accessible from my phone and computer so that s great 
len ratingfive  Keep ur documents w u
len ratingfive  My parents are in their early s and we use this app to automatically let us know when they arrive at home 
len ratingfive It takes a lot of worrying out on our part to know that they have arrived safely at home without making them feel like we are infantilizing them by our asking they check in when they arrive 
len ratingfive I m certain that as they continue to age it will also be helpful to locate them should one of them develop memory issues 
len ratingfive Looks like this is going to be a great backup service 
len ratingfive I stumbled across this app the other day and decided to download it and within minutes loved it 
len ratingfive If you re an amateur photographer and have thousands of pics on your phone taking up valuable space no worries 
len ratingfive Store them in Google Drive and delete the pics from your camera roll to free up some space

len ratingfive I can access all my stored things from any computer tablet or anything with my Google Drive account 
len ratingfive  GB for free and GB for year is great 
len ratingfive I really think Google Drive is really convenient easy to use and saved me a few times when I thought I lost an important document but it wasn t because of automatic backup 
len ratingfive  Works great and synced well across multiple devices 
len ratingfive Use it to share documents amongst users on multiple platforms 
len ratingfive  My school and work both have a G Suite that gives unlimited storage and these accounts are for life so I ve been migrating my hard drive files to Google Drive 
len ratingfive Also they come with data recovery should anything get deleted or goes missing 
len ratingfive I like that I can search for files quite easily 
len ratingfive I also take photos and will upload files for clients and share the folder with them that way they can access their pictures and they are stored securely 
len ratingfive I have used Drive now for the past yrs 
len ratingfive and I absolutely love it 
len ratingfive It hasn t failed me once never having a problem while using nor storing any of my files 
len ratingfive Best app to use 
len ratingfive You would be disappointed 
len ratingfive I find my Google drive so handy for downloading things easily on my iPad then opening and printing from my home or work computer 
len ratingfive Great tool for teachers 
len ratingfive  Always there when you need it 
len ratingfive This app has really preformed above standard it has helped me beyond measure in all I have needed it for 
len ratingfive  Productivity is impossible without drive for me now

len ratingfive  This app is absolutely amazing 
len ratingfive It is so useful to use in school I use it every day in multiple subjects 
len ratingfour  For a free app this is great 
len ratingfour I would love to see more notifications specifically when files are added to a shared folder

len ratingfive Google does almost everything right so you can expect this to be a perfect cloud storage app 
len ratingfive I have been using this app for years and it s a perfect way to store documents videos and pictures 
len ratingfive Would definitely recommend this app to anyone 
len ratingfour  Drop box has editing capabilities for word and the like 
len ratingfour Google needs to step up 
len ratingfour I love the extra space but it takes About min after it uploads to be able to watch it its pretty cool though
len ratingfour  I love Google and everything about their products 
len ratingfour What I would love to see from google drive is to be able to open Google docs Google spreadsheets etc WITHOUT having to open up the respective Google app

len ratingfive  Great app

len ratingfive Allows me to quickly store from device to device without worries 
len ratingfive Letting me grab my docs and files on the go 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive  It s a very good app and I can easily keep track of my school items 
len ratingtwo The app overall is great the idea behind it but it just takes sooooooooo long to download a simple photo 
len ratingtwo Even when im on wifi i have to wait for so looooooong to get just one picture i know there the make it available offline option but still to just load one selected photo is ridiculous 
len ratingtwo I see the loading logo more than i see my photos 
len ratingtwo No no no 
len ratingfive I can t easily imagine what anyone s complaint with this app could be apart from feature request 
len ratingfive I ve never been very motivated by any of the multi cloud integrations 
len ratingfive That is the only thing I can imagine leading me to criticize this app
len ratingfive  Love that it interfaces so well with mobile device
len ratingfive  Ya no tengo q estar pagandole a icloud para q guarde mis fotos

len ratingfive I haven t deleted any pics off my actual phone even after uploading them to Drive but we ll see 
len ratingfour  uploading videos from my phone was easier 
len ratingfour I find that it takes much longer and sometimes does not upload 
len ratingfour If anyone has ideas on how I can do this with ease let me know 
len ratingfour Otherwise Google Drive is a vital addition to my mo Ike office 
len ratingfive  Awesome best thing for organization and space 
len ratingfour I m a big fan on google drive both on pc and iOS 
len ratingfour It could function more smoothly on iOS but I think that s more Apple s fault than google

len ratingfive  I use it all the 
len ratingfive Mainly for storage 
len ratingfive I highly recommend it

len ratingfive with my brother who lives across the world in Italy 
len ratingfive It makes group projects at school x more efficient because everyone has access to the work so people can work on it more than just the times a week they have class together 
len ratingfive It has also allowed me to organize my drive with folders 
len ratingfive This has made a huge difference in my life and getting things done 
len ratingfive I am so grateful for companies like google who actually focus on how they can best help people

len ratingfive Google on the other hand is constantly doing things to make everyone s lives better

len ratingfive Chia s file ti n l i
len ratingone Most people may not notice them but if you upload many files it uploads via by size 
len ratingone There is no duplicate catch and the biggest problem it will not upload in background or any resume so if you spent the time to select a hundred or more files and hit upload and goes in background your pretty much screwed 
len ratingone Gotta watch it all the way and if not your gonna have to deselect and reupload and then deleted the ones that say copy it s stupid how doesn t anyone deal with this crap
len ratingfive  I can t function without it 
len ratingfive I use it for my business and my pleasure 
len ratingfive I love this app

len ratingfive  I love this app cause it helps me with my busy life 
len ratingfive I recommend it to all my friends and recomend it to you

len ratingfour thx 
len ratingfour  I love Google Drive 
len ratingfour The iPhone app is easy to use intuitive responsive 
len ratingfour As a physician I use it on a daily basis to store journal articles schedules and countless other things 
len ratingfour The GB for month is a steal 
len ratingfour But I left off one star because the iPhone version of the app does not seem to allow me to take photos of printed material and upload them as PDFs 
len ratingfour This is essential and I had to find another paid app to do this basic function 
len ratingfour Otherwise this app is a lifesaver 
len ratingfive  This let me access my files very easy and without any problems 
len ratingfive Only one wish if possible wish I can cast the videos in the folder to chromecast 
len ratingfive  Perfect 
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive This tool saved my professional life 
len ratingfive  Very convenient 
len ratingfive  With a laptop and several iOS devices I have been able to back up important files music and photos to my Google Drive and view them on all of my devices very cool 
len ratingfour This is one of the best apps out
len ratingfour  Wow owls
len ratingfour  Tool works well with a suite of Google tools 
len ratingone  There s no support for images in the RAW file type 
len ratingone I use this to store all of my photography work but I am very disappointed to not even be able to access my photos through mobile 
len ratingone Apps such as VSCO can process RAW files so why can t Google Drive 
len ratingthree  This is definitely a utility that you can t live without 
len ratingthree I need a switch where if switched on all doc pics etc would be automatically saved instead of doing them one by one 
len ratingthree I ve been relying on it more and more 
len ratingfive  Love it great app
len ratingfive  I LOVE IT 
len ratingfive Amazing app
len ratingfive The best app ever 
len ratingfive  So many uses 
len ratingfive Organized my life with drive docs sheets folders 
len ratingfive Genius 
len ratingfive  What can I say 
len ratingfive It works well and the various bugs that kept me from enjoying it have all been fixed 
len ratingfour  I love this app to death 
len ratingfour It helps me get so much done and not have to worry about using a flash drive or office and pay for it and then be able to come back to my iPad and look review my work 
len ratingfour I love to write books and this is the only thing that can actually store it and is easy to us 
len ratingfour I also use it to store pictures but the only thing I feel is missing is the ability to upload gifs and view them from the app on iPad 
len ratingfour You can go to the computer and view the gif file there but not on iPad 
len ratingfour If that was add this app would by far be a god sent 
len ratingfive I don t know how we ran our business before Drive 
len ratingone I cannot open most of my jpegs in multiple folders on either my computer or my phone 
len ratingone These photos are only saved in drive so I have no back ups 
len ratingfive  It s the best for a back up
len ratingone  to fluently use with MS Office products and so lags far behind OneDrive
len ratingfive This app is a bridge between Google and Apple devices 
len ratingfive Even when Apple is my to go device or apps I still got to work with google at work 
len ratingfive So this app allows me to my work home in my IOS devices to continue my ideas at home 
len ratingfive It is remarkable 
len ratingtwo  I want to see this app like DrobBox app 
len ratingtwo So when I upload from my computer I can download the Documents in my cellphone

len ratingfive My ID is emjiolover
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour I use it for all my stuff 
len ratingfour Best price for storage and features 
len ratingfour New ability to select and move multiple items is great 
len ratingfour Switching between apps to be able to edit docs is annoying but everyone else is doing the same thing and has for years Like Microsoft and Apple just saying 
len ratingfour I would love it if I could view my google docs within the app and then open them in the other apps when I wanted to edit That would make this stars to me 
len ratingfive  What a very nice application go ahead google go ahead 
len ratingfive Makes my life so much easier 
len ratingone If you re opening a audio or video or simply downloading it crashes or freezes to a point or device becomes unresponsive
len ratingfour  Its a very solid and stable app 
len ratingfive I know the app is free but i use this app almost everyday 
len ratingfive The only app I don t like within the drive family is the excel version 
len ratingfive I hate the navigation within it 
len ratingfive But the drive app itself is by far the best cloud storage system 
len ratingfive I love being able to put folder together and send it as an email or just work on files together with co workers 
len ratingfive  This has allowed me to stay organized and on multiple platforms 
len ratingfive Been waiting years for a cloud to keep up with my gadgets googles all I use
len ratingfive Drive is such a great resource produced by google 
len ratingfive I use it to store all sorts of information in many different categories 
len ratingone I m quite disappointed about the lack of description tab accessibility on mobile app 
len ratingone I need somewhere I can just copy and paste the description right away from my file image 
len ratingone The team just kind fo forgot about this IMPORTANT feature 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive  I have what I need with this 
len ratingfive Good for me all the way 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive  Excelente herramienta para redacci n almacenamiento y revisi n de documentos 
len ratingone A lot of work difficult to navigate
len ratingfive  I use it like everyday cannot life without it 
len ratingfive Amazingly useful 
len ratingfour I really like this app 
len ratingfour Easy storage and organizing 
len ratingfive  I could not say how this app is great so fantastic simple to use full featured you could do whatever with your files from you iOS device 
len ratingfive Best cloud filing system ever 
len ratingfive Google is truly committed to cross platform iOS OS X windows etc BUT the monopolistic and obnoxious platform owners that s you Microsoft 
len ratingfive don t always play nice 
len ratingfive FTC is looking or should be 
len ratingfive It may take a while but Google is going to win the cloud wars 
len ratingfour  Nice app
len ratingfive Useful along with other google drive apps docs sheets etc 
len ratingfive Keeps docs handy for any rushing occasion 
len ratingfive I haven t yet found anything that I don t like 
len ratingfive I can take an image or file from my phone drop it in Drive and go to my desktop to use it or work in the reverse 
len ratingfive Very fast sync between devices too 
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive Im dos melhores aplicativos da Google 
len ratingfour  Can be better but it s good
len ratingfive  Quite useful app 
len ratingfive Less reliable than Dropbox but also cheaper
len ratingone This is a great app the get me wrong but for about months now this app has been so glitchy and crashing while in mid upload which you can imagine would be very frustrating especially if you have a deadline for work 
len ratingone That being said google you need to fix this app asap 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive  Works well 
len ratingthree  Ok app hardly use I use google photo
len ratingfour When I copy numbered files from Dropbox to Goggle Drive GD doesn t sort them in the same way 
len ratingfour Everything else is great 
len ratingfive Handles real smooth
len ratingfive Makes it super easy to share files between my computer mobile phone clients and friends 
len ratingfive Love using it 
len ratingfive  I ruvvvv it
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfour Without this app on all my devices I d have already flunked out of grad school 
len ratingfive  Took a while to figure it out 
len ratingfive But it is great having all my files out in the cloud 
len ratingfive Great to access them from phone tablet laptop 
len ratingfive Edit anyplace 
len ratingfive Updated everywhere 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive for years and love it 
len ratingfive It s so convenient easy to use and FREE 
len ratingfive The app was designed well in that it allows you to do everything you would on a desktop 
len ratingfive I use Google Drive all the time 
len ratingfive It just gets better with every update 
len ratingtwo  Is very slow on the phone even with excellent internet connection 
len ratingtwo It crashes a lot
len ratingfive I love having this on my phone so that I can literally access my files from anywhere 
len ratingfive  I m living with terminal cancer and have used Drive extensively in my personal and business life 
len ratingfive I m more comfortable with reposing my life data with Google because Apple s steroid driven marketing and data gathering make me skeptical of long term availability 
len ratingfive Corpses sell no meta data 
len ratingfive In business it seems easier to impose restrictions on file sharing on Drive than on Apples multiple storage ports and devices 
len ratingfive Microsoft is late in the game and has good reason these days to maintain its image of ruthlessness and optimal profit 
len ratingfive  Really convenient and Great 
len ratingfour Works accordingly 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I store my life in the cloud on drive 
len ratingfive It has been solid for me and has made access to files a dream 
len ratingfive Some caution to googles use of my information but honestly I m not trying to hide anything from the world and I believe they have the best data collection of any company so I just pray they use that to make the world a better place 
len ratingone  Using the iOS versions of the Google Suite is like trying to work with one hand tied behind my back 
len ratingone Simple actions like inserting a picture that you have in your Google Drive into a Slide are a pain when compared to the web version 
len ratingone I would vastly prefer using the web based version in my iPad Pro but of course Chrome doesn t allow you to do so from iOS 
len ratingone You re pretty much stuck with these apps 
len ratingone If you have a full PC or Mac handy don t bother with these apps 
len ratingone Every once in a while Drive will erase or corrupt Excel files opened on iPad 
len ratingfive  Great 
len ratingfive  Neccesary for your storage demand 
len ratingfive I have enjoy using Google drive with my friends family and cronies
len ratingfive  A necessity for anyone who uses the google suite
len ratingone Crashes instantly every time I try to open a document 
len ratingone Useless 
len ratingone I ve downloaded every update restarted my phone have plenty of memory but Google Drive simply does not work 
len ratingfive  Google drive works like a charm 
len ratingfive Easy to have my documents wherever I need them 
len ratingfive I can do so much with my phone now that I started using this app 
len ratingfive Recommend to anyone 
len ratingtwo Really wish Google Drive had the feel and ease of Dropbox 
len ratingfive  A must needed app 
len ratingfive  Works really well 
len ratingfive I love the ease of sharing docs with coworkers and not having to worry about any space being taken up on my phone 
len ratingfive Also really like being able to pick up any device and having access to all of my files 
len ratingfive This app will save you on an economic level and I haven t experienced any bugs so far 
len ratingfive As a college student this is a must get 
len ratingfour Very good app
len ratingfive  It s incredibly helpful to have the info in my Google Drive available on my iPhone my iPad and on my laptop 
len ratingfive As a youth pastor keeping up with fundraisers events trips contacts and other items can be cumbersome but Google Drive has made it easy to keep organized and I love the functionality of the app 
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingfive Gud job goggle thanks for el thicc appo
len ratingfive Love the offline feature 
len ratingfour  Easy to use and access 
len ratingfour Some features in sheets not as easy to find as excel 
len ratingfive  I ve is really good for backing up my photos and for being able to read all of the things I need to in my drive 
len ratingfive This app is a life saver 
len ratingfive It s perfect when I m on the go 
len ratingfive It is also very user friendly 
len ratingfive  I use google drive for all of my documents so this app helps me find any document I need without my computer on hand 
len ratingfive It helps me organize all my school work it s awesome
len ratingfive  Great tool for neat freaks
len ratingfour  nd favorite file storage next to MEGA 
len ratingfour It could use a few new features 
len ratingfive  Its wonderful 
len ratingfive  Been using drive for years always dependable 
len ratingfive Never had a problem but I think some additional sharpening is added to images uploaded 
len ratingfive Maybe it s just me 
len ratingfive Either way stars 
len ratingfive  I ve been using Google Drive Docs and Slides for two years now and I ve never been more organized and on top of my work 
len ratingfive I ve been a teacher for five years and this has been the first year that I have heavily relied on the share capabilities of Docs 
len ratingfive It has changed the way I approach my classroom and assignments projects and assessments 
len ratingfive I have moved away as much as possible from relying on paper and packets and three ring binders in my classes and my students are now more organized than they have ever been 
len ratingfive I m a huge fan of Google 
len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingfive A free cloud if you will 
len ratingfive It allows you convenience and accessibility from anywhere 
len ratingfive I highly recommend that you use this app if your on the go and require access to your important docs spreadsheets PowerPoint PDF files 
len ratingfour  Easily accessible and handy to have all documents within a mobile reach does many things simpler 
len ratingfive  Excellent I love it
len ratingfive  Love that I can convert pic text to edit text and have it read to me
len ratingfive  Imma fan
len ratingfour  Don t use apple iCloud it s a junk 
len ratingfour They deleted my couple years ago photos i hope this app better 
len ratingone  Save yourself a bunch of hassles and just go with Dropbox which works better has better apps and is more comparable with a wide variety of apps and services 
len ratingfive  Does everything I need 
len ratingfive Good drive
len ratingfour  Easy to use fast quick sync can zip files
len ratingfive  Google Drive is by far the best functioning cloud storage out there 
len ratingfive Easy intuitive it just plain works 
len ratingfive Google Docs sheets and other products are ok but do not match up to MS Office products 
len ratingfive But as far as cloud storage this is the best out there by far 
len ratingfive Maybe I m a little close minded when it comes to newer more hip cloud type software but I don t really care 
len ratingfive I ve tried a few others but I have not come across any that come even close to Google Drive 
len ratingfive It s easy fast reliable and awesome and I have never found any I like more 
len ratingfive Keep it up Google 
len ratingfive  Couldn t be easier 
len ratingfive Let s me do everything I need to do with ease 
len ratingfive Life saver 
len ratingfive  I don t know what you use to share files for school projects and assignments if you don t use google drive
len ratingfive  I use it as well as the other Google Apps that compliment it and it works great 
len ratingfive My laptop broke so I m unable to work on anything outside of home but downloading these was definitely a solution 
len ratingfive So far I haven t found any bugs or gimmicks and I m satisfied 
len ratingfive  Very nice way to access or edit your files on the go
len ratingfive Google drive is so amazing 
len ratingfive It s helped me to organize my life and add more storage to it 
len ratingfive Haha 
len ratingfive  Take the time to read the infinite articles available and it just always works 
len ratingfive It took me a few years to get comfortable with the idea of using the google drive it started because my mom was using it as a collaboration tool for my sisters wedding 
len ratingfive I pushed myself to use it and now I love using it for all of my projects 
len ratingfive Drive gives me everything I need 
len ratingfive Space cloud access uptime and smooth integration with all my google apps 
len ratingfive Need I say more 
len ratingfive Cloud computing not only saves space on the computer it saves memories from being destroyed anytime hardware fails 
len ratingfive Great work GOOGLE 
len ratingfive Great for easy access on the go
len ratingfive  Excellent 
len ratingfive  I ve never had a problem with Google Drive and I use it frequently 
len ratingfive It s seamless and invisible unless I want it 
len ratingthree  Why does Google Drive not allow the saving FOLDERS for offline access 
len ratingthree I have to use Box instead for this functionality 
len ratingfour It s especially great because my teacher acct is through google
len ratingfive  Convenient user friendly large storage allocation easily accessible to any of my computers as I download desktop versions

len ratingfive  zahizero
len ratingfive I love this app for the numerous collaborations and document sharing needs in my life 
len ratingfive And I use forms to track my time and the time of others 
len ratingfive Only problem is some collaborators are slow to become comfortable with it 
len ratingfive  Same with Google Hangouts 
len ratingfive  I love this app 
len ratingfive I use it for everything and it gives me an extra sense of security in case I break my phone or tablet 
len ratingfive Plus I use it to share things from one device to another 
len ratingfive  Outstanding app found picks from my account I forgot all about 
len ratingfive The app is amazing 
len ratingfive It would be really great if you add Touch ID compatibility for the app for enhanced security 
len ratingfive Pls bring this update as soon as possible

len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfour I m using the Google Drive both for my work and personal storage 
len ratingfour It s an amazing reliable and very intuitive solution 
len ratingfive  Love how it keeps me organized and it s so easy to use
len ratingfive  Very easy to organize folders and just great app in general 
len ratingfive Never lets me down 
len ratingfour This is what I thought it was it can make a bunch of cool things but the reason it only got four stars is because it can not view my html files php files and other files that I made 
len ratingone Google is flat out terrible 
len ratingone My friend went to p into a point report and the doc had disappeared 
len ratingone We couldn t recover it anywhere 
len ratingone In my opinion you should use pages by Apple
len ratingfive  Very easy to operate and maneuver 
len ratingfive  I love the google drive always with me no matter what device I have 
len ratingfive Love all the apps
len ratingfive So far I m loving this app 
len ratingfive Does what it supposed to and you can keep your business with you at all times 
len ratingfive I ve been using Google Drive for all my files for about years now and I couldn t be happier with it 
len ratingfive They give you GB of free storage who else can boast that amount 
len ratingfive Terrific in my opinion
len ratingfour  I find cloud storage orgs that collect every scrap of your personal data be a bit creepy but I guess it is the way of things 
len ratingfour I love drive 
len ratingfour It is free at the low end and quite capable 
len ratingfour That said loading a word doc into drive editing especially but not only with track changes so someone else can accept each edit individually turned on and handing back to ms word is improving but still not quite there yet 
len ratingfour I blame protectionist monopolist Microsoft but still it is for now the standard which all must work around with 
len ratingfive  Convenient for school personal files 
len ratingfive I love this drive app 
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingone So bad
len ratingfour Love google drive the app on my iPhone not to good hit or miss if I can approve access
len ratingfive  Best app for cloud storage you can have for home usage and it links beautifully to your desktop gmail account and much more 
len ratingfive  If you need to access files across multiple devices this app is absolutely essential 
len ratingfive I store all my class readings on the drive and pull them up on my iPad in class 
len ratingfive This app is a lifesaver 
len ratingone I ve got two accounts one for my personal use and one for my son 
len ratingone When uploading photos to his account I switch to his g drive from mine and begin uploading 
len ratingone Files will get uploaded almost the entire blue bar fills up and then sit there 
len ratingone The upload never finishes 
len ratingone If it weren t for this issue I d give this a star review 
len ratingfive  Google Drive is a lot of cloud storage space for free Easy to use and web interface for anyone who needs it It s great for transferring files on my desktop that I want to access from my phone or iPad without much work 
len ratingfive Worth using and isn t full of lots of annoying adds 
len ratingfive I use this on my iPhone and think the functionality is perfect 
len ratingfive Makes me even more mobile I can work on a Doc Sheet or Slide show with ease 
len ratingthree Don t get me wrong this app is amazing for all my documents and slides that I use for class everyday 
len ratingthree However at times when I m looking at a PDF the app seems to fail constantly and black out entire parts of the PDF 
len ratingthree The only way I could correct it was by exiting and reloading it 
len ratingthree This wouldn t be as annoying if it didn t occur EVERY OTHER TIME I OPEN A PDF 
len ratingthree I don t know if it s my iPad Air that can t process the file or something with this app 
len ratingthree Either way it s a great app but can be very frustrating to use when it blacks out whole pages of my PDF 
len ratingfive It s great to reference my files on my phone 
len ratingfive I m not a guy to rate apps but google drive deserves it 
len ratingfive Free online storage that is available everywhere conveniently without crashing oh and it s free 
len ratingfive  Perfect nothing more dont wanna waste time on a review
len ratingfive Me gusta mucho
len ratingfive  Great App
len ratingfour  I couldn t live work volunteer without it
len ratingfive Google drive has always been amazing 
len ratingfive now obviously you don t plan to type pages of notes on your phone so I paid more attention to if it crashes doesnt load syncs quickly 
len ratingfive and it does all those wonderfully 
len ratingfive Excellent google drive
len ratingfive  Very intuitive 
len ratingfive Works great on mobile devices as well as desktop 
len ratingfive Great alternative to Microsoft 
len ratingfive  Works with everything 
len ratingfive Easy to share easy to upload easy to organize and a piece of mind knowing everything is in one place
len ratingfive I don t need frills lots of bells and whistles 
len ratingfive This app probably performs more value added features than I am aware of but my point is that it does what I need it to do 
len ratingfive It deposits documents I upload in a user friendly interface for easy location and reference at later dates pure simple 
len ratingfive  This is a very helpful app and is easy to use for personal or business use 
len ratingfive In particular the ability to use for collaboration 
len ratingfive It s been several years that I m using the google drive for free 
len ratingfive This application is so so good that I feel so so sorry for I didn t even right a review for you guys for such a long time

len ratingfive  One of my daily necessities
len ratingfive Makes coordination seamless

len ratingfive  Pretty good apppp
len ratingfive  WHY sharing moving videos from your iPhone is so FKD 
len ratingfive Well I don t know why sorry BUT GoogleDRIVE is THE answer 
len ratingfive Five stars 
len ratingfive  Such a great tool for cloud computing sharing docs collaboration and more 
len ratingfive  months ago it was very basic but more bells whistles such as tables and columns as well as shared templates are available now 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfive Nice app 
len ratingfive Works well
len ratingtwo Used drive to move FileMaker file to FileMaker Go but metadata is missing 
len ratingtwo Transferred copy does not display correct icon and FileMaker Go is not able to identify file as being of the correct file type 
len ratingtwo File does however open and function correctly 
len ratingfive  Always my first place to store my files 
len ratingfive Been using this app for years 
len ratingfive It s so sleek and since it stores all my files I can use them 
len ratingfive Love it

len ratingfive You know it s going to be a great experience 
len ratingfive I use this to transfer files between my phone and mac 
len ratingfive  It s handy I enjoy it it s easy I use Google Drive and Docs so many things 
len ratingtwo  Wanted to store receipts in Google Drive but found when sending receipt to Google Drive it will go to iPad Google Drive but not to Laptop which means Google Drive on Laptop is useless until it can sync or receive sent receipts 
len ratingtwo Also I m unable to download the app on my iOS cell phone to my desktop 
len ratingfive  Unlimited is max gb therefore NOT unlimited 
len ratingfive Sharing isn t that easy to figure out 
len ratingfive Automatic photo backup is better than every other provider 
len ratingfive Privacy of photos still questionable
len ratingfive  would recommend to by italian neighbor
len ratingfive  Amazing app 
len ratingfive I love the easy way I can use files in multiple locations without having having to carry a USB stick around 
len ratingfive It s the perfect solution for me 
len ratingfour  This is a great app but i want to be able to add a picture to audio files 
len ratingfour That would be wonderful 
len ratingfour Overall awesome app 
len ratingthree  Been using this for a few months 
len ratingthree Still needs to be tweaked a little 
len ratingthree Shouldn t have to stay active to update 
len ratingthree More like when connected to wifi it should continue to Sync 
len ratingthree But a good storage platform almost on par with iCloud 
len ratingfive User friendly and easy to use i just wish they wouldnt update it so much
len ratingfour I enjoy the benefits of the google drive a constant user 
len ratingfour I have only one complaint would be a happier user if I could establish a lock on some of my material on the drive 
len ratingfour In fact I would be promoting them from my roof top 
len ratingfour Short sweet Feb It appears that I raved before regarding google drive I still second my previous statements 
len ratingfour I m still waiting for more security on the drive for users 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingfive This is a rare occasion where an app out performs the desktop version 
len ratingfive Switching between account is light years fast here than on the desktop 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfive  It continues to be a well made software 
len ratingfour  Google Drive is a great simple and fast app for cloud storage 
len ratingfour It has many things going for it and generous Google let s you have GB worth of storage for free as a gmail user 
len ratingfour Microsoft OneDrive which I also have and like took away GB of free storage they gave use Outlook users and now we have GB 
len ratingfour Very nice 
len ratingfour Google Drive is faster but I like the look of OneDrive better as your folders feature a photo that is within the folder as it s dashboard identity 
len ratingfour The only issue I m having with the app is that it constantly crashes when sending files to the trash and that four stars 
len ratingfour I m running the latest iOS and the latest app version

len ratingthree I wish I could see and edit headings and footers from Microsoft office documents when viewing docs on this app

len ratingfive  Navigation visual display ability to print creating folders moving files all these are easy to do and easy to find

len ratingone I m automatically redirected to the app 
len ratingone I cannot download my PDF s to iBooks from the app 
len ratingone It has to be done from the browser which I can no longer do 
len ratingfive  This is the best app ever
len ratingfour  We run a small business with the drive 
len ratingfour This app allows good use and access from devices 
len ratingfour For IOS products There are two areas that need immediate improvement 
len ratingfour The ability to annotate and amend pdfs right from the drive is critical 
len ratingfour All of the apps out there that allow this but require syncing are buggy and cumbersome 
len ratingfour Consider that they all have different functionality and your device becomes Byzantine web of patched together tools that do this but not that 
len ratingfour Just let us markup and sign a pdf right from this and you ve triple the functionality of it 
len ratingfour Add in Apple Pencil and you d really have something 
len ratingfour Great job 
len ratingfour We love google drive 
len ratingfour This app can be so much better Hope to see these things soon

len ratingfour Gracias 
len ratingfour Ayuda

len ratingfive  Love google drive 
len ratingfive Accessible from all my devices 
len ratingfive Easy to share files 
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingfive  In my humble opinion Google Drive is simply the greatest thing since sliced bread 
len ratingfive It has made so much of my business so much easier than I could ever have imagined 
len ratingfive This is an essential app if you have an iPad Pro it acts as a file and storage finder 
len ratingfive With Google Drive I am able to use my iPad as a computer that serves every need I could ask of it as a Biochemistry pre med student 
len ratingfive I really love this app mostly because of the convenience and how easy it is to use 
len ratingfive I love that it s connected to my Google email account and it is overall just a very easy app to manage 
len ratingfive  Easy access from any device 
len ratingfive Great storage

len ratingfive Very few apps work always properly 
len ratingfive Goggle drive is one 
len ratingfive I m very happy with this app it has never failed me yet

len ratingthree I have enjoyed using Google Drive at no cost since its inception and have always been appreciative of the use of its software and storage 
len ratingthree Almost as user friendly and intuitive as Apple products in terms of practicality 
len ratingthree I have not found that the word processing or office app facilities are able to function as well as MS Word and hence still use the others when I can 
len ratingthree For a free service you simply cannot complain 
len ratingthree I am now running over my GB of free storage and am having to bite the bullet and pay for service 
len ratingthree Still monthly is not too high a price to pay for a TB of storage 
len ratingthree What bothers me the most is that there is no way to pay for this on an annual or even multi year basis 
len ratingthree Instead we are required to go monthly and with automatic debit 
len ratingthree I find that very similar to the closed system that is Apple and something that I had hoped Google would differentiate itself from 
len ratingthree To say I am disappointed would be an understatement 
len ratingthree I hope that Google will reconsider this policy and provide multiple ways to pay for the service when the time comes 
len ratingfive This is so much better than iCloud 
len ratingfive  This app is pretty easy to navigate through 
len ratingfive Great for storing documents notes photos what ever you want to save 
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingfive Best app ever
len ratingfive I am not sure how I was productive before I had Google Drive

len ratingfive  Me and my friends are making a videogame and we use Google Drive to share concept art 
len ratingfive It s working perfectly so far and uploading files is very easy 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app 
len ratingfive Works well
len ratingfive  The best way to organize your life 
len ratingfive Save everything keep it clean and you ll be more productive more insightful and happier overall 
len ratingfive  It holds me down 
len ratingfive Keep it up 
len ratingfive  One of the best cloud service around 
len ratingfive Easy to use and worth it

len ratingfour  I love the ability to easily access my documents and storage from any of the platforms I use at any time 
len ratingfour I do not like it s lack of a robust method of moving things to and from my drives 
len ratingfour The extension to do this in Windows is spotty and has major problems for my systems 
len ratingfour It keeps disappearing and doesn t always install properly 
len ratingfour Right now it won t install on my PC 
len ratingfour After I tell it to install the extension it appears to install 
len ratingfour But then it keeps telling me to install it

len ratingone There used to be a workaround where you could log into Google Drive in safari but now the Google Drive site won t allow you to log in if you re accessing it from a mobile browser like Safari so it s a total no go 
len ratingone I switched to Dropbox on this and all my other devices for hosting

len ratingfive Great help
len ratingthree I like the ease of keeping files on the drive but it arbitrarily decides to only allow you to send without sharing sometimes and then when the person emails to get sharing permission the drive will not allow you to grant it 
len ratingthree Other times it does allow you to grant the person permission to view or edit but you never know if it will or not 
len ratingthree This needs to be fixed

len ratingfour The Products google drive and iCloud Drive are great products for the Cloud Age but Remember they are not built for Privacy specially GDrive Google looks through your data and sells them to advertisers and the NSA can easily use the data Meanwhile iCloud I believe is a safer choice Apple does not sale your Data NSA might still have access but encryption at least ensures local hackers do not access your data Some might argue vs GB but only c gives you GB But For people who value privacy get a TB Hard drive and store docs photos over there Storage is quite cheap nowadays please do not sale your Data to Google for only

len ratingfive  Good if you want to save files photos etc
len ratingthree I really do not understand why Google drive uploads take so long for medium sized files 
len ratingthree A MB file takes a half hour or longer if it uploads at all 
len ratingthree The same file uploaded to Apples ICloud Drive up loads in seconds 
len ratingthree I use Google Drive on two iPhones and several computers it s pretty slow on the Windows computers and seriously slow on the iPhones

len ratingfive That s pretty big for me that it s easy to access and easy to pass along those files when I need to 
len ratingfive Very useful tool to share files and to backup info 
len ratingfive When did such a resourceful and awesome app become free of charge 
len ratingfive This app neatly organizes arranges and stores all my important documents 
len ratingfive It allows for the filing keeping of an online personal record of all important documents that are also able to be shared via email 
len ratingfive This has become the eliminator of piles of paperwork stacked up everywhere 
len ratingfive Due to my currently not having my own laptop it s been my only means for keeping track of and or having copies of all substantial material on a computer database Hard drive database system enabling transfer capabilities

len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive A perfect way to keep your documents accessible and organized while extending the memory capacity of your Apple device 
len ratingthree  I m not sure if this has been mentioned yet or even if it is a capability but when listening to music and only being able to hear one track at a time is lame imo 
len ratingthree But as far as being to listen to whatever and whenever is a plus but I hope they update the drive to be able to listen to multiple songs 
len ratingthree One thing I do believe on the comp you can but as far as the IPhone goes nope 
len ratingfive Just like the title says I love it 
len ratingfive  I use it to reference documents on the go all the time an awesome tool 
len ratingfive This app is really amazing and easily accessible
