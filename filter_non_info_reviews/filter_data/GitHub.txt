len ratingfive It makes it easy to stay abreast of your projects and connected to your team while on the go 
len ratingfive Wow

len ratingfive It s a well made app and it seems to be free of bugs 
len ratingfive It s nice to be able open source code on my iPhone and read it just like I m home or work

len ratingfive That I believe would make it somewhat easier for the ones that do this app on their phones like I do and i know for myself speaking it has made my life so much easier when I have this app on and I can now take care of other things at the same time as well Know with the app changes now
len ratingfive I have enjoyed every much being able to go to GitHub and get help with updates on my phone and the people who work there are kind and respectful i Apologize but I don t enjoy my APIS at google but the service a quality is worth every thing I wish I would have known about them before I did my developer and beta certification program I would like them to know how grateful I am to have them and the help that they have given me and

len ratingtwo I would like to know how I can correct the illegal actions that others have done to me and my family members 
len ratingtwo I have Been working for over a year now 
len ratingtwo Since I am not a coder or programmer it has been very challenging to Say the least 
len ratingtwo The people who have been doing this to my family members do not and have not had the best interests to use your platform in a way that is for the greater good of humanity 
len ratingtwo I would appreciate if u could assist me with my account information correcting every account that is not correct 
len ratingtwo Over a year of work is long enough I know the details I would appreciate for you to send out a few updates to help me out ASAP thanks for the information
len ratingone Sign in from Safari works fine but the app redirects to a message about cookies using the embedded browser 
len ratingtwo Commit history widget is horribly ugly 
len ratingtwo Instead of displaying a static slightly outdated collection of commit history it shows a network error 
len ratingtwo If you live in any city and take the subway expect the widget to be frequently broken and just look horrible on your homescreen 
len ratingtwo I expected more from an app made by supposedly leading developers
len ratingfive To use it now
len ratingtwo Reviews
len ratingfour It is fast convenient and awesome 
len ratingfive Works as expected for an FTP 
len ratingfive  Can you please help me correct my links and loading and downloading of web browsers 
len ratingfour Things just happen to become more and more user friendly 
len ratingfour Greatly appreciated
len ratingfive The best
len ratingthree  please i want my github account to be deleted permanently cause i think someone is controlling my phone through that app through a desktop version please and it s bugging me
len ratingthree The app doesn t appear to be able to create branches or edit files 
len ratingthree Why isn t that working 
len ratingthree That s primarily why I installed it 
len ratingfive I like it very much
len ratingfive  I love them
len ratingfive  steps uses actions name Build the site in the jekyll builder container run docker run v github workspace srv jekyll v github workspace site srv jekyll site jekyll builder latest bin bash c chmod sr

len ratingfive Very informed also for me a newbie they take time for your skill set 
len ratingfour Good
len ratingfive  web app 
len ratingtwo Pages fail to load half the time providing only a generic something went wrong message even when navigating back to a page that has already been loaded 
len ratingfive GitHub is a expert and challenging way to keep track of your database of information 
len ratingfive You can get everything you need and more in one convenient place 
len ratingfive Extremely useful and well coordinated 
len ratingfive A masterful app 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingfive What a well made app 
len ratingfive Great work 
len ratingfive I use it daily to monitor my PRs and review others PRs at work 
len ratingfive Being able to view code on the go has come in handy as well 
len ratingfive I only wish there was an equivalent of the homepage that shows what my friends are star ing 
len ratingfive great application
len ratingone it hangs on load and doesn t allow keyboard input
len ratingfive After years of not having an iOS app this is amazing

len ratingfive This is excellent great work accomplishments

len ratingfive This is the best platform for impressive growth 
len ratingfive Many opportunities arise with the base of this platform

len ratingone Won t let me click the username or password input to enter then 
len ratingone Any time I download another app GitHub just appears randomly I think it s a glitch or a virus please fix it 
len ratingone  Okie
len ratingfour I d like this app to get support for the project area of repos 
len ratingfour That s how I track progress on my apps and it would be nice to be able to hop on the app to add reminders in there to do things or see how a team is doing 
len ratingfour In fact that s the thing that a GitHub app would be good for 
len ratingfour But sadly it s lacking 
len ratingfive Super smooth and well polished 
len ratingfive My favorite app by far 
len ratingfour Review
len ratingfive Don t have much experience or knowledge but far every think seems alright 
len ratingone The new that you added for new issues is taking up way too much space at the top creating a whole new row of empty space and it s hard to reach 
len ratingone Make it a floating action button in the bottom right 
len ratingfive Good to have

len ratingfive You have got to try for days Premier Fully featured with charts for nearly every asset including crypto

len ratingfour GitHub makes learning fun while I wait for Pi to be on the market 
len ratingfour I left a four instead of a five because I really am very unsure what I m doing 
len ratingfive  can easily perform common workflows 
len ratingfive It s been a while since I tried using the GitHub app on iPad not even sure how long it has been officially supported but I have to say I m blown away by the quality and functionality 
len ratingfive Being able to do code reviews from my hardware keyboard enabled iPad with almost the same ergonomics as on the desktop web client is a game changer and unlocks a whole new level of productivity on the go 
len ratingfive If one day we see first class GitHub Codespaces support inside the app it may just redefine what a dev machine can be 
len ratingfive  New to coding and this app has helped me out
len ratingfive So much fun to learn from allot of smart and kind people 
len ratingfour  Love all the information fab app
len ratingone It s impossible to explore any large code base without getting an error something went wrong for hitting secondary rate limit 
len ratingthree So I relizes that when u delete the app and then downloaded it again it s gonna say sign in but really it s just to log in but I m not trying to be a Karen the is good overall but it needs a sign in and log in pick n choose so I give it a star rate
len ratingfive Word for what I needed to read code
len ratingfive Took a little time to learn but that was it 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone I hate it you can t sign up
len ratingfive Arm window was where beak began its vertwocal f for wheredowhooooooo
len ratingfour It would be great to be able to manage releases and actions from the app 
len ratingfour Also searching for text within a file would be nice 
len ratingfour  can t wait to learn more about your app
len ratingfive Hello world guess I know who I am now I ve been having a lot of challenges here lately and now I know 
len ratingfive It s been a riff years but git
len ratingfive Hhshd
len ratingfive Can t be a software engineer or anything around the internet w o GitHub
len ratingfive  Hhshd
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Ive done that like five times now is that enough
len ratingfive One feature I wished the app had is the ability to edit a repos wiki 
len ratingfive I often want to write down ideas and I have to create an issue and then move it later 
len ratingfive Also add labels to issues and assignees would be great 
len ratingfive Otherwise it has all the features I use 
len ratingfive  Amazing app intuitive
len ratingfive  Wow
len ratingfive Reciclando reviews
len ratingthree The app works okay except I keep running into Oops 
len ratingthree Something went wrong errors that appear to be caused by API rate limits 
len ratingthree In other words GitHub appears to be rate limiting GitHub 
len ratingthree I don t know 
len ratingthree All I do know is that I can t browse code effectively without it blowing up in my face 
len ratingfour Help
len ratingthree While the app works ok not as great as mobile web the most important missing feature for me is multiple accounts for GitHub com 
len ratingthree It s not uncommon for folks to have a company handle not GitHub enterprise and a personal account 
len ratingthree Right now there s no way to easily switch between them or get notifications for both
len ratingfive This better give me the Minecraft account that I want
len ratingfour Crashes literally all the time 
len ratingfive The app works great for the most part 
len ratingfive Although currently I am trying to view a particular file in a PR with files that have been changed but I cannot view anything beyond the first that are listed 
len ratingfive Scrolling to the bottom does not load more files and I cannot find a way to search for the file name of interest directly 
len ratingfive  Hi Lpr thanks for the feedback 
len ratingfive The bug that you are experiencing has been fixed already and will be included in our upcoming update 
len ratingfour GitHub web has made an incredibly amount of improvements since being acquired by Microsoft such as the AMAZING and innovative web editor they launched a few weeks ago 
len ratingfour Unfortunately the iOS team has not kept pace 
len ratingfour That being said the web experience is good for reading through Issues reviewing some PR s but ultimately the web experience is better in many ways on my iPad especially with the web editor 
len ratingfour On a phone can t beat it stars by default but stars on iPad 
len ratingfour So I will round it out to stars but quite disappointed in the iPad app 
len ratingfive Features are constantly improving 
len ratingfive After hour emergency PRs reviews are easily handled quickly 
len ratingfive Caused me to turn off email alerts as this is much easier to manage 
len ratingfive I wish it had a search bar in the repositories page though
len ratingfive  Money wise
len ratingfive  tomi x
len ratingfour Nice
len ratingfive Hielail
len ratingfive Very intuitive and powerful to do codereviews away from the desktop
len ratingfour Great app includes everything you need to access issues pr s and other critical features 
len ratingfour The one thing I haven t seen yet is gist viewing 
len ratingfour When I click a gist in notifications it opens in the browser 
len ratingfour I would want a way to view gists too 
len ratingthree There is no enterprise login on iPadOS when etas it on Android 
len ratingfive X
len ratingthree Nice
len ratingthree The application is a very lightweight version and I mean VERY 
len ratingthree You could get more done by opening the web browser in your phone and signing in because the only thing this app lets you do is create errors
len ratingthree  Nice
len ratingfive  Hi I am
len ratingfive ranjaw
len ratingfive I love doing code reviews on my phone as well as other repository management like commenting on issues 
len ratingfive Really an accelerator in my day to day job and allows me to be responsive even if I m not at my desk 
len ratingfive Some companies have trouble developing mobile apps that have parity with the desktop experience but Github has definitely knocked it out of the park 
len ratingtwo  I truly want to like this app but the bugs that have been around since I first used it are driving me crazy 
len ratingtwo Every time I add a new favorite it ll disappear from my list a few minutes later sometimes right before my eyes it ll remove itself from my list 
len ratingtwo On top of that the search functionality is atrocious and way too limited 
len ratingtwo We can t even search our own repos 
len ratingtwo The search functionality we do have for the rest of the site leaves a lot to be desired and doesn t even return the same results as the website 
len ratingtwo We should be able to search our starred repos our own repos as well as choose how our own repos are filtered this is bottom of the barrell functionality that should be a no brainer 
len ratingtwo If its possible on the website it should be possible in the application 
len ratingtwo Im honestly shocked at how little functionality this app offers as the official github client 
len ratingtwo Navigating the app is a PITA compared to the website 
len ratingtwo But you can t really just go to the website anymore after installing because it forces you to the app 
len ratingtwo You also can t do everything from the app so I find myself constantly pulling out my laptop just to do simple tasks on the website 
len ratingtwo Quite annoying 
len ratingtwo JUST LET ME USE THE WEBSITE 
len ratingfive Writer Artist And Poet Of Children s Books 
len ratingfive sound check check check
len ratingtwo  Seems the browser view controller won t allow me to input any text 
len ratingtwo It just shows the sign in form and continues to just zoom in and zoom out every time I try and select the field 
len ratingtwo Kind of frustrating 
len ratingtwo Guess l ll be uninstalling 
len ratingone I can t login using iPad 
len ratingone Asking me to enable cookies I did but still doesn t work
len ratingfive I m a non technical founder who was thrusted into a product management role unexpectedly 
len ratingfive I was more than pleasantly surprised I was blown away at the amazing user interface and the ease of use especially for someone like me who is not familiar with this technology I also really love the mobile app as I was able to test and put issues in on the go very impressive I appreciate what you guys have done 
len ratingone  With in the community
len ratingfive  Incleible
len ratingtwo There are several major problems 
len ratingtwo I can t list issues or pull requests that I have commented on but did not create or am assigned to 
len ratingtwo I cannot edit the commit message before a squash merge 
len ratingfour Love the app 
len ratingfour One bug Jupiter notebooks ipynb are rendered in Raw JSON as opposed to being formatted into a preview or html rendering of the notebook editor 
len ratingfour One suggestion Some history option would be appreciated 
len ratingfour Especially on IOS where it is very easy to accidentally swipe from the left of the screen and trigger a back by mistake when intending to pan left in a side scrolling text box 
len ratingfour Other than that love it 
len ratingfive Very interested to know what the app is built with 
len ratingfive Just pure native 
len ratingfive  steps uses actions name Build the site in the jekyll builder container run docker run v github workspace srv jekyll v github workspace site srv jekyll site jekyll builder latest bin bash c chmod sr
len ratingthree The app is extremely useful but its just missing features available on desktop 
len ratingthree Major Missing Features Transferring issues Projects suggestion autocomplete Technical Issues Uploading or embedding an image crashes the app Sometimes the app slows my entire phone randomly but that could just be my iPhone
len ratingfive Files Fixed By Python 
len ratingthree Easy flow between windows order of menu links are seamless 
len ratingthree Well organized content 
len ratingfive  Learning
len ratingfive I am lovin all the latest lately 
len ratingfive A Long hold platform syst
len ratingfive Duong
len ratingone Every time I click on something it just won t let me type nothing I don t know how and I don t know why my I can t chat with you or just talk to you on the phone
len ratingfive Usefulness sometimes 
len ratingfive I rate it out of 
len ratingfour GitHub Actions required in the app 
len ratingfive  Duong
len ratingone  These are my terms of service Pay a day for using the nul system or leave I am tired of years worth of abuse pay or get off
len ratingfive I very rarely leave reviews for apps but this one deserves it 
len ratingfive I am a mobile app engineer and I can say without a doubt this is the most pleasant app I have had the pleasure of using 
len ratingfive The designers deserve an award for the amount of features they were able to pack into an intuitive experience 
len ratingfive Anonymous privacy is nearly perfect 
len ratingthree Idk yet
len ratingone  So this person use this application to completely steal my whole ID I don t do this coding stuff but I was able to do some research and plus with all the information I was able to uncover I find out that this person was able to iCloud install hidden widgets inside of apps literally record me through my own camera without my knowledge I ended up getting a locked out of my iPhone a few times thousand dollars towards a man had to call the FBI and the police still not going investigation notifiedThe support team showed them the flight out evidence I have and all I requested was that all these devices including mine that are under my name I just want to be able to never open account with my information because I do not have any use for this and they couldn t even do that for me They told me they protect the person s privacy well I hope protecting his teeth which I know who this female is and I showed you guys is worth it because I am going to take this as far as I need to go there is a ready and I m going investigation thanks for nothing 
len ratingone Beware guys I m sure she s not the only one that uses the app for the wrong reasons and clearly even though in the privacy policy she is breaking the law and their rules are not accessing her own account they still do anything about it 
len ratingone No I had to drop over on my lawyer this has literally been a nightmare
len ratingfive GOODJOB 
len ratingfive Nice work 
len ratingfive A time saver app nice 
len ratingfive Helpful App Thank you for the information 
len ratingfive  star
len ratingfive Thank you for being a great team
len ratingfour I have a repo and I can review it but cannot make files 
len ratingfour Gets me ticked off I can t work on my repo when I m not near my PC 
len ratingfour Good software though 
len ratingone  Not very useful 
len ratingone Browser is better 
len ratingfive I don t know how to completely code yet but actually let me be real I don t know how to at all but I m thankful ahead of time for when I do IG Mayciedolll
len ratingone I do not know how to use this thing I have tried and tried I do not have a computer I only have my phone I am disabled and I need my money so with the government watching this please release it but I m about to be homeless this is ridiculous
len ratingfour I want to clone the code use app but I can t find clone button in the app i want to know where i can see the clone button 
len ratingfour I am in China region 
len ratingone This app is just the networking side of GitHub 
len ratingone Maybe it s useful for some 
len ratingone But you can t download anything here so 
len ratingfive This application works great
len ratingfive  askgaryvee dopebiz
len ratingtwo The color brightness for contribution history is the opposite of what it shows on the website 
len ratingone This app doesn t work with Enterprise accounts using SAML SSO unless you also use Enterprise Server 
len ratingone This is really frustrating as all our links in slack automatically open the GitHub app to an error screen unless we delete the app entirely from our phone 
len ratingone Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingfive It s a good learning experience for me so thanks
len ratingone I dont have an account and it wont let me create one
len ratingfive Just started and I can t wait to get deeper into communicating with others 
len ratingone If I could give stars I would 
len ratingone All negative experiences in my mins use 
len ratingone There is no apparent way to search in organization no easier way to switch branch when browsing code 
len ratingone This is not something designed for someone who really work on professional code 
len ratingone Nothing compares to this app get it
len ratingfive As
len ratingthree I Always Use GitHub On My Computer Without An Account But On Here You Have Too Login I Dont See A Register Button So I Had TooDid It On My Computer Overall Very Good Website App

len ratingfive thanks for giving my life meaning github the best hub on the internet
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive simplecodewriter
len ratingfive Franciscopolanco
len ratingfour The only other thing I ever seem to wanting from the mobile app is the ability to see the actions for the repo 
len ratingfour Besides that everything is great 
len ratingfive Great good
len ratingfour GitHub is a big web app so having this in mobile form is pretty good 
len ratingfour Just missing some key features and functionality that make me still go to the mobile website rather than the app 
len ratingfive Been using this app for the past year and so far it s been pretty crisp and nice 
len ratingfive Smooth UI that makes things easy to navigate 
len ratingfive The app complements the GitHub website very well 
len ratingfive I just got the app and there is basically zero learning curve 
len ratingfive The user experience is intuitive and seamless with the GitHub website 
len ratingfive Excellent for commenting updating reviewing pull requests 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Currently trying out but very good 
len ratingfive Nice dark mode
len ratingfive  Everything good
len ratingfive Great place to learn stuff
len ratingfive GitHub app gets better and better 
len ratingone Really don t understand the concept of designing this way 
len ratingone The amount of flexibility you provide in desktop version this app version is far away from this 
len ratingone  Really sorry to hear that you don t like the design and feel that your workflow is constricted 
len ratingone The good news is we would love to hear more from you 
len ratingone Could I ask you to get in touch with us at 
len ratingfive  steps uses actions name Build the site in the jekyll builder container run docker run v github workspace srv jekyll v github workspace site srv jekyll site jekyll builder latest bin bash c chmod sr

len ratingone We would like to try to help you resolve this issue 
len ratingone Could you please get in touch with us on and we will try to get you unblocked
len ratingfour  Love being able to interact with my repos quickly but would like it to be feature complete repo management project management
len ratingone I tried everything to make something out of this app but it doesn t work nothing works about this app
len ratingfive ETF
len ratingfive  Y
len ratingfive  So I plan on using this application more often it s a little hard to connect to but with time I think I can manage Seems like a challenge and advice would be helpful
len ratingfive GitHub thank you 
len ratingfive  goodbyefornow
len ratingfive Haven t used fully so can t tell if good or not
len ratingfive To be fair I m a newbie 
len ratingfive I tend to feel lost in crypto and app and while I m psyched to be a part ofThings I usually feel quite ignorant 
len ratingfive This app kind of is able to push me through step by step to get me where I need to be 
len ratingfive And that s not an easy task 
len ratingfive So I love it I feel smarter every time I leave the app 
len ratingfour I need a edited time in the code page like the webpage
len ratingfive Never Disappointed With GitHub 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Awesome experience app
len ratingtwo Update This was fixed but Squash and Merge is broken again 
len ratingtwo  Not bad at all for a v but unfortunately I can t use the merge feature until I have the ability to edit the commit message during squash and merge 
len ratingtwo It s actually kind of dangerous because you think it will work like the web app giving you edit ability after pressing the button and then merging on another press of confirm 
len ratingtwo However the iOS app just straight up squashes and merges leaving your with a dirty commit message on master 
len ratingtwo I would rank higher if they just didn t support squash and merge yet but since they chose to ship a broken feature that causes harm I can only give two 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo Version now has the ability to edit the commit title and message before merging 
len ratingfive This app was not so useful early in its life but steady improvements have made it so that I don t need to switch to the website to get most common things done 
len ratingfive Well done and keep it up 
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingfive Rarely does a web based service that s been around for years put effort a good native app but this one is downright excellent 
len ratingfive  Very well made 
len ratingfive Very helpful for looking at my own and others PRs on the go 
len ratingfive I do wish there was a way to view the home feed in a nice format I enjoy seeing what others star 
len ratingfive Besides your own repos the discovery section actually does a pretty good job of recommendation based on things that are relevant to you and the interface is just great in general 
len ratingone DO NOT TRUST 
len ratingone DO NOT DOWNLOAD THEY DO NOT LET YOU REMOVE THEIR DATA AND ABILITY TO SPY ON YOU 
len ratingone I apologize upfront but internet and cyber anything was my prison it was used to monitor me in an abusive relationship this git hub no idea what it is but it non stop comes up and the email address that I can as abused with is registered 
len ratingone I can only say that I tried once in feb to run but tracker 
len ratingone I remember my victim advocates face when I began crying they asked what was wrong a person who I never seen before plugged a charger in the wall for her phone I began sobbing he will find us now 
len ratingone I believe you have hurt me
len ratingfive All of the latest updates are very helpful 
len ratingfive Great work 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingthree Hello 
len ratingthree We use an enterprise account and use SAML SSO to login but when I try to login through the app it doesn t have the SSO option 
len ratingfive  Around Globe
len ratingthree  Search results are irrelevant sometimes and frustrating
len ratingfive I believe that they are truly the best thing since the new iPhone 
len ratingthree This is definitely useful but I would not use the mobile app to do PR reviews regularly 
len ratingthree Too easy to miss critical context or information on the small screen 
len ratingthree Also too much is presented at once 
len ratingthree This app could be improved by better managing the intention of the person using it 
len ratingthree Deliberately switching modes of inquiry and having the UI adjust is probably better than being able to do anything at anytime 
len ratingthree MS Word does this with their toolbars and that s okey for a word processor 
len ratingthree It is burdensome in a mobile app where thoughtful review and clear communication is the end goal 
len ratingfive Perfect assistance for me
len ratingone The code files aren t configured to view on mobile iPhone Pro and I have to scroll all over the document just to see the code properly 
len ratingone I would have imagined that Github of all apps would have an efficient way to see code 
len ratingone Guess not Really sorry to hear that you are having some trouble 
len ratingone Code views and definitely something that we are iteratively improving 
len ratingone Would it be possible for you to get in touch with us at 
len ratingfive Freedom
len ratingfive Great mobile experience for reviewing PRs when you re away from your computer 
len ratingfive Thank you so much
len ratingfive GitHub for iOS works great for me to view my repos manage issues manage pull requests amp merges 
len ratingfive I ve been using git for a long time and this app since it was released 
len ratingfive For about weeks I had an issue being able to view some of my repos 
len ratingfive The GitHub team came through with releases with improvements and new features during that period AND fixed the issue viewing some repos 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfour Droma configuration management github bas been pushing the integrative boundaries
len ratingfive An incredible app that feels clean intuitive and powerful 
len ratingfive They manage to make each release bigger and better without overcomplicating the UI 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work 
len ratingfive When the new Apple Silicon M came out the GitHub app on it was very helpful 
len ratingfive But since macOS we can t use sideload iOS app on Mac until the developer offers it in the Mac App Store 
len ratingfive So PLEASE just click the Mac button in Connect app and add it to the MAS 
len ratingfour Great game
len ratingfive This site is amazing helping you design I recommend it to everybody
len ratingfive Really feels like the website but better 
len ratingfive Super smooth and intuitive UI and navigation and the features and improvements just keep coming 
len ratingfive I have it set as the default app for all GitHub links on my phone and there s no going back 
len ratingfive GitHub on iPhone is such great ux 
len ratingone the feature should be considered in mobile Application
len ratingone When I try to log in it says that it needs cookies 
len ratingone However Settings gt Safari gt Block All Cookies is disabled so I don t know why it s giving an error 
len ratingone I m using iPadOS 
len ratingfive I love using the iOS app especially on my iPad to keep track of issues assigned to me and to assign workload to staff 
len ratingfive If I made more interesting things I m guessing the code review options would be great too 
len ratingfive Maybe someday 
len ratingfive  Great good
len ratingfive This is such a joy to use 
len ratingfive I only wish there were more notification settings 
len ratingfive You can do almost everything you can do on github com 
len ratingfive The UI is appealing UX is outstanding 
len ratingfive App performs flawlessly on my iPhoneX 
len ratingfive I couldn t ask for more 
len ratingfive Not to mention the app gets updated frequently 
len ratingthree GitHub for iOS is alright 
len ratingthree I love studying other people s code and reviewing my code whenever I leave my PC but whenever I m browsing code too fast 
len ratingthree I get this You ve triggered an abuse detection message when I m just browsing through files 
len ratingthree Also usually when I first click on a directory it says Try again as in it didn t load properly but when I press it I get that Abuse message again 
len ratingthree And then it keeps saying Try again as if I m on timeout 
len ratingthree Very glitchy 
len ratingthree I usually just click the dots and hit share and just go to the Safari version 
len ratingthree I end up really just using this app to shortcut to my Safari GitHub 
len ratingthree You can also edit your code from the Safari app but not from this GitHub app 
len ratingthree Would appreciate if that feature became a thing here 
len ratingthree Really only one or two things keeping me from a star A fix to that abusing rate limit thing And the ability to edit our code from this app 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Excellent work GitHub
len ratingfive Lots of updates recently is a very pleasant to use app overall I just wish I had more to use it for
len ratingfive So many thing issues that I can t fix including pull requests everything have to be fix and ready to use still a lot of things going to do
len ratingfive It s awesome but I still can t create pull requests on the go so that s a shame 
len ratingfive Super helpful for any dev who needs to check any new requests or issues
len ratingfive One of the best apps I ve ever used 
len ratingfive This is such a great way app to see all of your repositories 
len ratingfive Finally I can respond to requests and search repositories on the go 
len ratingfive There are a lot of Github iOS apps out there 
len ratingfive Although this one seems promising 
len ratingfive I am still checking out the features but this seems to do well 
len ratingfive Best github experience on iPad ever 
len ratingfive  Great good
len ratingfive This is a fantastic app 
len ratingfive It s exactly what I wanted when I wished GitHub would make their own app 
len ratingone  Badly broken app won t view GitHub repos 
len ratingone Zero diagnostics 
len ratingone Zero help 
len ratingone Just that message Something went wrong 
len ratingone Try again You may want to move all of your repos to another service 
len ratingone New release May same errors 
len ratingfour As more time goes by definitely appreciating the app more and more 
len ratingfour New merge experience added is really nice and mirroring GitHub web is definitely helpful 
len ratingfive Great Application with very helpful individuals ready to help you if you need anything 
len ratingfive Thanks Again GITHUB 
len ratingone  Badly broken app won t view GitHub repos 
len ratingone Zero diagnostics

len ratingfive  Great good
len ratingfive  GitHub has gotten me through the hardest time of my life 
len ratingfive FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SITE AND APP 
len ratingfive  I believe that they are truly the best thing since the new iPhone 
len ratingfive Just don t ask me how it works yet 
len ratingfive Simple and clean
len ratingfour surprisingly useful 
len ratingfour i d love to see a view for github actions the Checks view on PRs though 
len ratingfour It s hard and cumbersome to navigate to them and see results or download any artifacts of a build eg a review build to download and test on the phone
len ratingfive The only
len ratingfour I try to change language but it jump to app setting in system settings
len ratingthree  Overall a good mobile experience however the fact that it s still just single account not multiple GitHub com accounts is really unfortunate 
len ratingthree When can I finally sign in with multiple users personal work 
len ratingthree Another thing that bothers me The search history is useless 
len ratingthree Recording the search keyword only automatically causes friction since the user has to again select whether it s an organization repo etc he she wants to search for 
len ratingthree Why not record whatever the user has selected prior for quick access via search without adding it to favorites 
len ratingfour the app delivers lots of key features such as discussions and issues however their is no support for code editing 
len ratingfour Their are a lot of times where i find a small bug in my code like an element having the wrong class in html this kind of issue could be fixed relatively easily and doesn t require any form of dev 
len ratingfour environment 
len ratingfour I wish i could simply edit the code and submit a pull request with the correct change 
len ratingfour Their are also some small graphical issues like the commit graph is colored the inverse way it is on desktop this kind of issue is relatively easy to get used to 
len ratingfour Overall the app is pretty amazing 
len ratingthree I have one for personal which is a pro account and one for work 
len ratingthree My employer does not want me using a personal account and I completely agree 
len ratingthree Both are GitHub accounts so I cannot be logged into both at once 
len ratingthree Would be much better if I could since I m doing one thing during the day and another at night 
len ratingfour No projects tab on the app 
len ratingfour Can you please add the feature I m the app as well 
len ratingfour I added the app in mobile recently only for that purpose 
len ratingfive  Como cierro Mi cuenta
len ratingfive A app
len ratingfour  Good
len ratingthree Awesome app 
len ratingthree It s really useful to receive updates from collaborators and work with them hassle free 
len ratingthree I find it a very nice companion for the Github web client and Desktop version 
len ratingthree The only problem I have is that I can t make changes to my repos 
len ratingthree If I could upload files and make changes to them like editing text and code adding removing files then this would be a Star app 
len ratingfive So I just got this and when I sign in it doesn t sign in I tried like times with the password and the email it keeps saying wrong password even though I checked and it s right I don t know what to do can anyone fix this 
len ratingfive GitHub brings joy to everyone contributing to the digital collective good 
len ratingfive Success is easier to see and communicate because of GitHub 
len ratingone  I saw a video on TickTock sponsoring this video showing that you could spam your friends messages via spamming a bunch of numbers with this app I was very disappointed to see when I downloaded this app and logged and I saw the option where there is messaging but no area where I could spam their messages
len ratingfour  Good
len ratingfive  I would love to learn more on adding favorites

len ratingfive Well GitHub promises to be better than most 
len ratingfive I had to clean up my emails so today I just deleted them all from my past go to account all thousand of them 
len ratingfive Many were from an app called Google plus oh or years ago 
len ratingfive We loved that app we were young restless 
len ratingfive On Google plus us wanna be acclaimed scientists would theorize on the basis of gravity the universality of relativity and what not 
len ratingfive Instead today I mostly anticipate the final burn seeking some satisfaction along the way 
len ratingfive I ve been immersed into this world of hackers cyber crimes network insecurity constant uncertainty and you know what I m starting to enjoy it 
len ratingfive My antagonists know one hellava lot about networks and I m determined to oh I really don t know what I m determined to do but I kinda enjoy sparring with these unseen contestants 
len ratingfive We will see I m now determined to share what I ve learned and I thing GitHub is where I ll do it 
len ratingfive I just am completely lost in finding a way to start 
len ratingfive But I will SOON
len ratingfive  Really really really great
len ratingone The app doesn t seem to support access to Enterprise organizations or their private repositories 
len ratingone Edit Despite what the developer response might say Private organizations are still not supported 
len ratingone  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone Version of the app now has support for Enterprise 
len ratingone Just tap on the Profile tab select the Settings gear and manage your accounts to add an Enterprise account 
len ratingfive That s all 
len ratingfive Nothing more 
len ratingfive Nothing less 
len ratingfive It works exactly as you d expect it to 
len ratingfive App is very well organized 
len ratingfive Perfect 
len ratingthree I just started but it seem like it will be useful for learning how to investment
len ratingfive  Anytime I can get away from the desk but still get the work done is a bonus 
len ratingfive I never want to be blocking someone else s efforts so the ability to review fix commit etc is invaluable

len ratingthree I d love to give this app a higher rated review but it bugs me that you can t access your gists from it 
len ratingfive  Thank goodness GitHub built an app 
len ratingfive I regularly interact with GitHub notifications pull requests issues on my phone 
len ratingfive While the mobile web experience is improving daily the app supercharges it 
len ratingfive I don t have to pause my workflow until I m at my desk 
len ratingfive Just send me the information about the new one
len ratingfive Great App for GitHub on iOS
len ratingfive  feels like a part of iOS
len ratingfive  Best in the same
len ratingone Why know why 
len ratingone So I typed my username and password and it says incorrect username and password I typed warrobotsfan and it dose not work give me user name that is war robots EDIT or make update that u can sign it with google Facebook Twitter
len ratingfour Ready for work 
len ratingfour When do I start 
len ratingfour Plus l caught the part about the license and insurance 
len ratingfour Didn t catch who pays for the gas 
len ratingfour The wear tear and gas is also my responsibility 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive  Because of GitHub the next generation of talented innovators web designers and engineers will be able communicate better faster and project manage more equitably 
len ratingfive It s a collaboration hub and community of doers stars cherries and s 
len ratingfive A very beneficial application for all things STEM 
len ratingfive Features are all super well laid out 
len ratingfive UI is spotless 
len ratingfive Such a great UX as well 
len ratingfive So impressed with Github 
len ratingfive Since this whole quarantine thing I m stuck inside playing with Arduino and raspberry pi 
len ratingfive I m and don t get out very often anyway 
len ratingfive Special thanks to everybody that contributed their time and hard work 
len ratingfive You don t know how much us dummies appreciate you 
len ratingfour  Y
len ratingfive I ve been using this for a number of years and love that I am connected to my team even when I m out on the road 
len ratingfive Being able to easily interact to keep things moving adds value to what I do every day 
len ratingfive  Yes I really like GitHub and I m learning so much 
len ratingfive Please send me links for beginners so I can advance my knowledge 
len ratingfive Thank you very much
len ratingfive Let s me stay in touch and know when things are happening even when I m not at my computer 
len ratingthree I just wish the app would allow editing of files 
len ratingthree It would be the perfect GitHub app if that was included
len ratingfour Overall the github app feels easy and natural to use 
len ratingfour It also looks good and clean which makes it enjoyable to use 
len ratingfour Although there are some features that are on web but not on the app which often makes me press Cancel when prompted to view in the app 
len ratingfour  The lack of the Wiki tab is pretty rough if I just want to check on something that was documented Kind of niche but on Web github will convert org mode files to look the same as markdown for READMEs 
len ratingfour On the app it renders it a plain text which makes reading emacs documentation a bit tough Overall good app though and I m excited to see what to come
len ratingfour  I m liking it still wish it was even more versatile and had more options in settings for those who need to manage their account from just their phone it s nice though 
len ratingfour Istill learn something new everyday with kuberneties 
len ratingfour Update Universal SECURITY VULNERABILITIES SIDE NOTE COULD USE A HELPIN HAND Need to please get help to have my accounts syncing Under one and not nested 
len ratingfour I would love to have all the docs in all the right spots and have them in all be the same for profit and revenue 
len ratingfour I m homeless and would very much like to not live in my car with my dog chiefy 
len ratingfour  Chiefy is awesome and I love him so much That being said I still feel a lil guilty and I ll give away some code in the future but at this point in time I need income and some help getting organized 
len ratingfour I really struggle with that part but I think I make up for it in the discovery department 
len ratingfive Intuitive and has the main things I need PRs and issues 
len ratingfive  Hurray zero push perhaps as well 
len ratingfive Or thus defend the script be the script of which it s not but can thus stitch back so needs the valences of thought and time and energy to do its do of yay
len ratingfive Love that I can review PRs from my phone 
len ratingfive  The Open Issues tab needs to auto refresh after closing an issue 
len ratingfive Best in the business
len ratingfour Where I used to rely on external tools or a browser to review code on the fly this app makes it very easy 
len ratingfour There is room for improvement with repository discovery and navigation but if accounting for organizations vs individuals there should be some solutions on the horizon 
len ratingone This app has severely limited what I can do with github repos while using my iPad 
len ratingone No forking repos 
len ratingone No following releases only watching or not watching only 
len ratingone No find in page because searching sends you to the global repo github search 
len ratingone No creating repos 
len ratingone If you are an active software engineer or user of github this app will restrict you 
len ratingone Just use your browser 
len ratingfive Lot of features are getting pulled into the iOS app 
len ratingfive Love using the app to review minor PRs and merge them on the go 
len ratingfive Great work
len ratingone Ok the problem is that when i open Github i want to sign in but it wont let me I click the username email i want to write my user and password but it doesn t work my keyboard doesn t show up 
len ratingone If anyone else is having this problem they could be scamming you for your email 
len ratingone Please dont put information on this app it could be a scam 
len ratingone Please stay safe 
len ratingfive Just created an issue for my repo and was able to quickly upload photos 
len ratingfive Good feature parity 
len ratingfive Wish you could switch accounts but otherwise great 
len ratingfour  I m liking it still wish it was even more versatile and had more options in settings for those who need to manage their account from just their phone it s nice though 
len ratingfour Istill learn something new everyday with kuberneties
len ratingfive Best
len ratingfour For example file search is missing 
len ratingfive Without projects like git hub open source code would be a pipe dream 
len ratingfive However github offers an opportunity for anyone regardless of experience to learn develop and grow their ideas into projects which can open the door to making dreams become reality 
len ratingfive This is the tool if you have software ideas that you want to crowd source by sharingPublic repositories and collaborating with as many other interested developers in working on an open source public community driven fashion as well as theAbility to share closed source projects privately with team members on your development of yours or their project s 
len ratingfive Excelente work
len ratingfour  Security vulnerability and constant attack by user defined bots 
len ratingfour Other than that and constant threat of being cut out and left in the dust at every corner it s nice 
len ratingfive Super well made you can now approve PR everywhere 
len ratingfour Wish there was a way to view Actions natively 
len ratingfour Otherwise great app 
len ratingfive It s great to finally have an app 
len ratingfive Stellar 
len ratingfive Supports dark mode and seems to support Dynamic Type size everywhere 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Hope you bring this app to Mac 
len ratingfive  P S 
len ratingfive The latest feature spotlight text even says tap here not click 
len ratingfive Always feels like I m in a losing battle saying tap 
len ratingfive Glad to see someone else keeping it alive 
len ratingfive And it keeps getting better with every release 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work team 
len ratingfive If you re working with a team the app is a nice easy way to keep updated on changes 
len ratingfive  Rojas As Many
len ratingfive Thank you thank you thank you 
len ratingfive Overall this app is great 
len ratingfive It allows for easy parsing of GitHub repos and creating issues 
len ratingfive The only idea for the app is a search filter 
len ratingfive Already you can search public repositories but you are unable to filter your results farther than repos vs profiles vs companies such as being able to limit your results to just repositories that are made with JavaScript 
len ratingfive  I like this app 
len ratingfive  it s cool to create things on here 
len ratingfive  Would probably check it s out
len ratingone The website makes so much sense this app is hot garbage The app is organized around REST api calls instead of how people use stuff Basic stuff like where are the boards and issues for an entire organization 
len ratingone Look at the GitHub website and make a smaller version instead of this weird organized app
len ratingfive When this app first launched it didn t have quite the ease of use that I tend to expect from github related projects 
len ratingfive But in the updates since then it has improved significantly and become an essential part of my workflow 
len ratingfive  Y

len ratingfive Naps 
len ratingfive Such a tall order to take all the best GitHub desktop features and squeeze them into an app 
len ratingfive Super well done 
len ratingfive I enjoy GitHub and need more resources on compiling programs 
len ratingfive Well designed and actually useful on the go 
len ratingfive No doubt it keeps many developers from using other git platforms 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive Really awesome how much they put in their mobile app 
len ratingfive Great work GitHub team 
len ratingfive Zzzzzzzz
len ratingfive  Zzzzzzzzz
len ratingtwo Mostly an ok app 
len ratingtwo The comment panels cover the code and there is no clear way to close them 
len ratingtwo Tried multiple ways before I finally gave up and switched over to Safari which just works btw 
len ratingtwo  Sorry for the confusion 
len ratingtwo We significantly redesigned the code review commenting experience 
len ratingtwo Please give the updated app a try and let us know if that solves the issue 
len ratingfive I use GitHub all day at work tracking issues reviewing prs keeping up with the project in general 
len ratingfive The GitHub app puts all this bundled into a nice package on my phone 
len ratingfive Great experience so far 
len ratingfour Could use more functionality for working with projects and issues but it is a really handy app and it keeps getting better 
len ratingfour Works very well on an iPad 
len ratingfour Work great for git operations 
len ratingfour It s missing some GitHub features that would be nice to have Projects Actions etc 
len ratingfour I didn t know that GitHub on my phone was something I was missing in my life but dang this app is increasingly useful 
len ratingfour Clean design intuitive increasingly powerful 
len ratingone Cannot sign in no keyboard presented
len ratingfour Website functionality is not quite all implemented but does help you stay on track 
len ratingfive  Use of the app was very helpful and easy to use
len ratingfive  I don t know what I m doing right now
len ratingfive  Enhanced
len ratingfive What is says it does I love it every day 
len ratingfive Really solid app for working with GitHub 
len ratingfive  Love this app using iOS 
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfive GitHub really did a good job with this one pushing the limits of what could be done on mobile
len ratingfive I mean come on 
len ratingfive It s GitHub 
len ratingfive But I would like some way to edit text in repos
len ratingfive It runs perfectly
len ratingfour I love managing my source issues and pull requests here 
len ratingfour I only wish I had visibility into my projects instead of having to go into each repo individually to see the issues 
len ratingthree Needed to enable factor authentication for my account but I could not find a QR code reader to finish the setup 
len ratingfive Never thought GitHub on mobile would be useful but it s awesome
len ratingfive You can tell the builders actually use it Obviously GitHub is best used on a full desktop browser but for mobile this hits a sweet spot
len ratingfour This app is great I can easily read code and do almost everything that I need to from within the app 
len ratingfour The one thing it s lacking in is editing the code 
len ratingfour It would be really cool if they added this even if it was limited to just a text editor like on the github website 
len ratingfive A good sibling for the great web products 
len ratingfive Needs improvement
len ratingfive  I love this app and I like cooperation between the two employees who look like a bee cell
len ratingfour This may be due to the settings of said repository but it would be helpful to at least say that in the app 
len ratingfour I somewhat doubt that s the case though why would it be ok to view issues in a web browser but not an app 
len ratingfour Otherwise the app is great 
len ratingfour When I got to a repo to look up an issue there are none listed at all in the app 
len ratingthree If something is in your notifications on the website then it should be a notification on the app as well 
len ratingthree If I haven t marked it as done online it should have a red badge app icon and show up in the app as well 
len ratingthree Aside from that the app is good 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Kudos to the team 
len ratingfive Would really be awesome to create Pull requests through the app and merge them just like the web version 
len ratingfive Also enjoy having formatting show up immediately without needing to preview first
len ratingfive One of the most important parts of my workflow is using projects I need this to work on iOS and on iPad app ASAP please 
len ratingfive What a amazing experience is this app 
len ratingfive Good work 
len ratingfour Can view PRs and review merge but for me it s missing some key items keep in mind this is iPad centric I appreciate that it does ANYTHING on the iPhone Can t comment on PR commits Can t navigate next previous PR commit Can t collapse PR files Can t expand hidden portions of PR files Can t change PR label When I m using this app I m on the go trying to review as much code as possible 
len ratingfour So any variance from the workflow I can accomplish on the browser is felt pretty hard 
len ratingfour  Could use more functionality for projects and issues but it is a really handy app 
len ratingfour Works well on an iPad 
len ratingfive Never leave home without it 
len ratingone For small maintenance and quick changes on the go this would be huge 
len ratingone Guess I ll uninstall and keep using the website in safari 
len ratingfive I mean do I even have to say the obvious 
len ratingfive Github is the now will be the future 
len ratingfive Having code searchability within the app would be extremely useful 
len ratingfive Either lines of code or file names 
len ratingfive  What exactly in laments terms does this app do 
len ratingone No updates for people using iOS 
len ratingone  it says safari can t secure a connection to the server 
len ratingone this goes for the website as well and also on chrome and firefox 
len ratingone what do i do 
len ratingthree  good morning reach and where moment is agree the license the problem is the cell es oh lora type etc
len ratingthree I d like to be able to do more with the app but it s a good start 
len ratingone  The app doesn t seem to support access to Enterprise organizations or their private repositories 
len ratingthree I love the app right now but I m missing some functionality that would take it to the next level 
len ratingthree Multi user support 
len ratingthree I often times have two or more github accounts and need to be able to sign in with two different users 
len ratingthree External github server support 
len ratingthree In order for this app to really work for a lot of us we need to be able to sign into our companies hosted github instances 
len ratingthree Without this I can only work on the open source stuff or on things on my personal github account since the github instance I use for work cant be accessed using the app 
len ratingthree I want to give you the stars and when those two things happen I will come back and change the review 
len ratingthree Keep up the good work 
len ratingthree I use Github for many things but gists is one of the most used features for me and I do not see a way to use them in the official app 
len ratingthree Please consider adding support for gists 
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingfour Doesn t support GitHub wikis 
len ratingfour  Yet 
len ratingthree I ve already submitted a bug report on this but none of the wiki page release or Kanban board links work right with the app 
len ratingthree Any link to instructions on a wiki just redirects right back to the root of the repo 
len ratingthree It s a decent app but this frustrates me a lot leaving this only useful for responding to issues or looking for new projects not actually doing anything productive 
len ratingfive I use the GitHub app on both my iPad Pro and my iPhone and both work flawlessly 
len ratingfive Great design and the ease of use is phenomenal 
len ratingfive Great UI 
len ratingfive Really feels like a native IOS app 
len ratingfive Is user allowed to edit file and commit currently 
len ratingfour Each update adding more functionality 
len ratingfour Still a few things missing from web interface eg project kanban etc but all the things it can do it does very well
len ratingone It s apps like this that reinforce Apple s insistence that we constantly upgrade which then breaks all of our old stuff that s been working perfectly fine for years which infuriates me 
len ratingone I see absolutely no reason that this should not be able to run on iOS but it won t 
len ratingfive No
len ratingtwo The app seems to have the basic functionality but what I really need its the project boards and that s nowhere to be found 
len ratingtwo Also this compounds to the EXTREME 
len ratingtwo Frustration of this application opening every single Github link on an application that can t even compare with the web version 
len ratingtwo I will give it a try in months or so 
len ratingthree There are so many things I want to do and the app is a good starting point to get somewhere faster 
len ratingthree However I want to be taken to the full website to explore more 
len ratingthree I wish it could link out and not redirect l 
len ratingfour Great app does exactly what they list in the description amp does it well 
len ratingfour I do feel like it falls short on project issue management though 
len ratingfour In particular you can t do anything with project boards which I rely on quite a bit 
len ratingthree Overall the app is just okay 
len ratingthree I ended up having to uninstall it because somethings don t work as expected 
len ratingthree For example if a repo is using the Wiki functionality it s not viewable in the app 
len ratingthree Thus if you click on a link to wiki content it just brings you back to the main repo page in the app instead of the actual wiki content 
len ratingthree The only resolution was to uninstall the app so I can view the content in Safari 
len ratingthree At this point it only gets stars 
len ratingone  There are so many better tools out there at all levels for free freemium and premium 
len ratingone This app is garbage 
len ratingone Basically just a dumbed down mobile website viewer without the additional benefit of view desktop like you would have with Firefox and even Safari these days 
len ratingone Missing standards Forking repos Significant edits of repos Renaming security etc settings for repos FaceID integration Ability to set timeout for login on phone currently once in always in Missing features you d expect with this coming from the GitHub MS team directly Generation management of keys for GH account Ability to save store keys to phone Generation management of private codes for app dev Ability to save store keys to phone Ability to set certain private repos with additional password features on phone App to App integration with TOTP verification Enterprise tools upgrades that come with your enterprise level account Ability to create custom non templated build sheets in app not on web and then clicked on in app Go with something like Working Copy or Gitwork Plus or Terminus or even GitHawk vs this nonsense 
len ratingone Or better yet still switch to bitbucket via Atlassian 
len ratingfour I love being able to keep up with all my issues through my phone 
len ratingfour The user interface is clean and it s easy to search for repositories 
len ratingfour However there is a feature I would like implemented 
len ratingfour I would like the ability to view releases in the app 
len ratingfour It s annoying when I go to a notification for a release and tap on it only for it to send me to the website 
len ratingfour And if I click a link to the releases of a repository in my web browser it opens the repository in the app but doesn t show me the releases 
len ratingfour Overall great app and if that one feature was added I would be glad to give this review five stars 
len ratingfive I love how quickly the app loads and how easy it is to look at issues PRs etc 
len ratingfive It s also a very lightweight app in terms of memory 
len ratingfive It doesn t try to do anything that would be too complicated on mobile either which is nice 
len ratingfive One constructive criticism I don t know if I just missed this feature but I would LOVE to get push notifications about updates to repos I m watching 
len ratingfive I haven t been able to find this feature anywhere on GitHub and it s definitely a must for this app 
len ratingfive I am a novice developer and a recent CS college grad 
len ratingfive This feels like such a natural transition for GitHub as a whole 
len ratingfive I don t know if anything will ever beat the desktop laptop experience but using this on my iPhone X has been a pleasant experience 
len ratingfive The app does not advertise or make any false promises 
len ratingfive It does exactly what it says it wants to do it would be pretty horrendous if it didn t given the developer 
len ratingfive Being able to keep up with notifications is what mobile is all about 
len ratingfive I can only imagine how much better this is on an iPad especially an iPad Pro 
len ratingone Want to like this application don t want to see it every time I tap a GitHub URL 
len ratingone  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone To disable Universal Links long press any GitHub link in Safari then tap Open in Safari 
len ratingone Every time you tap a GitHub link in the future the destination URL will open in Safari instead of GitHub for mobile 
len ratingone Garbage app 
len ratingone I can t log in even with cookies enabled 
len ratingfive  Rivera
len ratingone  Help
len ratingfour This app is incredibly useful 
len ratingfour I don t have my laptop on me wherever I go so it used to be a chore to review pull requests collaborate on issues etc 
len ratingfour This app fixes that and puts all the power of collaboration right in your pocket 
len ratingfour Seriously incredible user experience 
len ratingfour One feature suggestion I often need to upload images to issues 
len ratingfour Currently to do this I have to open my camera app take a photo open github pick the photo I took wait seconds for the image to upload iPhone s photos are really high fidelity mb in HEIC format upload the photo 
len ratingfour If instead I could open the GitHub issue take the photo right there in the app upload instantly rather than seconds I would be very happy 
len ratingfour Is this feasible 
len ratingfour Thank you devs for your work on this app 
len ratingfive What the title says
len ratingone  Lfeventsandcateringservicesllc is A Home Business you have Cyber Terrorized And Listening To Me In My Bedroom you are notified I Will Be Serving you federal human rights violations as well as hate crimes and cyber terrorizing since Latoya U Frazier
len ratingtwo How to find the approval 
len ratingtwo What will the Merge button do 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for this feedback 
len ratingtwo We are working on improving the merge UX right now 
len ratingtwo You can view reviews either in the pull request timeline or by tapping the Merge button at the top and expanding the reviews section 
len ratingtwo When tapping the merge button it wi
len ratingtwo I wish mobile site was equivalent to the app 
len ratingtwo I end up switching to mobile site every now and then because either the UX is so different or just doesn t have a feature 
len ratingtwo The app feels like a nice to have than GitHub really thinking out it s mobile strategy with desktop mobile site and mobile app functionality 
len ratingtwo Feels like to independent teams worked on this 
len ratingfive Thank you very much for developing this program 
len ratingfive It is very useful for me 
len ratingfive The app seems pretty nice thus far but I wrongfully logged into another account and now it seems that there is no way to change it 
len ratingfive When I sign out and sign back in I m only prompted to give permission for the initial account also why is asking for authorization every sign in 
len ratingfive Doubt that this is how is intended probably a bug 
len ratingfive Would reconsider review once I can properly use it with my account 
len ratingfive Update As expected the switch account was unintentional and now is back to normal 
len ratingfive So far I had no problems and I love having a proper app layout rather than the mobile version that wasn t bad at all btw 
len ratingfive You could argue that now you have yet another app to keep checking for notifications but hey it is what it is 
len ratingfive  Sorry for the confusion 
len ratingfive We re working on making this experience better 
len ratingfive In the meantime to login with another account go to GitHub com in Safari and logout 
len ratingfive Then you should be able to login with another account in the app 
len ratingfour  Love being able to interact with my repos quickly but would like it to be feature complete repo management project management
len ratingone When you login you get to the page to authorize github for iOS ave the green authenticate button is greyed out 
len ratingone Can t login 
len ratingone Pretty worthless app 
len ratingfive GitHub is a great app because it lets you work with the more social media type of features 
len ratingfive It needs to be updated a lot more so that it becomes at the same level as the online version but the social media features definitely keep it afloat 
len ratingthree The ui is a bit confusing imo 
len ratingthree Hard to slide Up on the action area 
len ratingthree Not easy to just review and merge imo Thanks 
len ratingfive Giving stars just for the fact they actually tell you what they changed in each update 
len ratingthree Cannot seem to close or unsubscribe from issues in the app 
len ratingthree  On an issue or pull request you can swipe up from the bottom to show a list of actions like unsubscribe and close 
len ratingthree We are working on improving this design so thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive This makes Github super mobile friendly 
len ratingfive Amazing what you can do with a few taps 
len ratingthree  The app seems pretty nice thus far but I wrongfully logged into another account and now it seems that there is no way to change it 
len ratingthree When I sign out and sign back in I m only prompted to give permission for the initial account also why is asking for authorization every sign in 
len ratingthree Doubt that this is how is intended probably a bug 
len ratingthree Would reconsider review once I can properly use it with my account 
len ratingthree  Sorry for the confusion 
len ratingthree We re working on making this experience better 
len ratingthree In the meantime to login with another account go to GitHub com in Safari and logout 
len ratingthree Then you should be able to login with another account in the app 
len ratingone Why does this app keep redirecting me to the browser 
len ratingone What s the point of even having an app if it just opens the web browser 
len ratingtwo I can t use the app because I can t even login 
len ratingtwo After clicking on sign in button it takes me to github page where I m supposed to authorize the app to access my account but the page only shows a list of permissions with a disabled Authorize GitHub button 
len ratingtwo I guess there is a hidden checkbox somewhere for agreeing terms or something of which checking it will enable the button however I don t see anything like that so I can t login 
len ratingfive  Love the free and safe
len ratingfive I have been infatuated with github ever since the day I realized the level of hacked I was 
len ratingfive It s a honor to have been part of all this and that I am awesome 
len ratingfive Queen Kristi 
len ratingfour On my iPhone SE I literally can t read the names of my projects because the containing organization LongishCompanyName fills the horizontal space 
len ratingfour Either let long names wrap or scroll or provide start end middle truncation or at least let me create alias short names for Favorites 
len ratingtwo Multiple tabs bookmarking sharing links Handoff between devices a history of everything you ve looked at these all features you get for free by using GitHub in a web browser but things you aren t allowed to do in this app 
len ratingtwo Even worse the app eats all GitHub links so you can t even view a GitHub page in a browser if you want to 
len ratingtwo I would rather have the web version of GitHub be more responsive and full featured at any screen size than have limiting platform specific apps 
len ratingtwo This isn t when the iPhone first came out you can t get away with having a limited mobile version of your website and a basic app with a limited subset of functionality anymore 
len ratingtwo It s great to have a native iPhone app finally but the app is constantly failing to connect and asking to try again 
len ratingtwo Then and probably the worst is that after you write a comment and submit the app returns an error 
len ratingtwo It s not clear if it actually saved or not 
len ratingtwo In some cases it doesn t and others it does 
len ratingtwo I ve accidentally submitted the same comment x and other times thought I submitted a comment and it never submitted 
len ratingtwo I expect more from github 
len ratingfive  Very handy for viewing interacting with much of the site
len ratingthree Cookies must be enabled to use GitHub 
len ratingthree But GitHub on iPad has a lot of space for improvements 
len ratingthree Can t we have same UI as web application in iPad 
len ratingthree  We recently released a brand new iPad design that uses a new sidebar design to make better use of the space 
len ratingthree We hope you like it 
len ratingfive  The commits or pull requests list should show the author names like it does on the website 
len ratingfive This is the main reason I still primarily use the mobile website instead of the app 
len ratingfive  code anywhere 
len ratingthree The app is good but I would love a edit code feature 
len ratingthree This would allow me to edit my applications on the go and host the new versions instantly 
len ratingthree Why can t I create a PR 
len ratingtwo The app is ok I can t edit markdown files which is a shame but I d have kept the app installed if it didn t hijack web access to github com 
len ratingtwo I open a link of hacker news and end up in the app which I don t want 
len ratingtwo Deleted 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo To disable Universal Links long press any GitHub link in Safari then tap Open in Safari 
len ratingtwo Every time you tap a GitHub link in the future the destination URL will open in Safari instead of GitHub for mobile 
len ratingfive Feature request make switching from one account to another easier 
len ratingtwo  Even though it s good Github has came out with the official app some important features are not there yet 
len ratingtwo Writing commit messages on squash merge and viewing Github Actions is missing 
len ratingtwo The polish isn t up to par as well 
len ratingtwo There are desync issues and the app can be slow to load 
len ratingtwo It s in active development though so I expect things might be changing for the better soon 
len ratingtwo Until then the website will still offer a much productive interface 
len ratingtwo  Version now has the ability to edit the commit title and message along with more merge options 
len ratingfive The bug was promptly fixed 
len ratingfive Thanks for tracking these reviews likes hawk y all are doing great with the app and it runs way faster than the webapp 
len ratingfive Updated from to stars 
len ratingfive Old review When I start to type using the on screen keyboard in a comment if I type quickly the panel dismisses and I have to reopen it to type 
len ratingfive This is the most aggravating bug in the history of bugs 
len ratingfive I will happily change my rating once this is fixed 
len ratingfive  Thanks for the feedback this was a frustrating bug 
len ratingfive If you update to at least this bug should be fixed 
len ratingfour Can i pls be able to see my starred repos I can t even login something to do with cookies Thanks for the question 
len ratingfour If you go to Home and tap on your avatar in the top bar there is an option to view Starred repositories 
len ratingtwo  When I start to type using the on screen keyboard in a comment if I type quickly the panel dismisses and I have to reopen it to type 
len ratingtwo This is the most aggravating bug in the history of bugs 
len ratingtwo I will happily change my rating once this is fixed 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for the feedback this was a frustrating bug 
len ratingtwo If you update to at least this bug should be fixed 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive My only request is access to Github Enterprise 
len ratingthree  I couldn t authenticate my account with this app second factor 
len ratingthree Just reviewing PRs and that s it
len ratingfive This app makes it easy to show your code to people and manage your repository s from anywhere 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive Great work 
len ratingfive Love being able to check PR s anywhere 
len ratingfour Need the projects section 
len ratingfour The Kanban boards are very useful and without them the links to issues is awkward 
len ratingfour But generally I like the app 
len ratingfour I took the time to complain 
len ratingfive Git hawk was good but this app is great 
len ratingfive I wanna work in Github 
len ratingfive MicroSoft 
len ratingfour CI shows incorrect status on some of my repos compared to github com clearly a bug or some cache that needs to be cleared
len ratingfour  Can i pls be able to see my starred repos Thanks for the question 
len ratingfour If you go to Home and tap on your avatar in the top bar there is an option to view Starred repositories 
len ratingfive  of what I use the GitHub site for is reviewing PRs 
len ratingfive This app makes that quick and easy 
len ratingfive I was able to merge an approved PR from my phone while waiting for my car outside an auto repair shop 
len ratingfive Thanks for this app 
len ratingtwo  request to load pull request frequently fail on the first try submitting comment sometimes throws an error saying the operation failed but when I refresh the page the comment is actually there the review modal closes seemingly by itself multiple times when I m typing a review and I have to reopen it to finish writing the review I think the app is needed especially with iPadOS and more people using magic keyboard 
len ratingtwo I hope there is continued investment in the app and these problems are addressed 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfour Not bad at all 
len ratingfour It would be better if add in rendering readme file feature
len ratingfour My only complaint is that I don t know how to download the files
len ratingfour It would be nice to be able to make minor edits markdown documents from the App 
len ratingfive This app singlehandedly made me love GitHub again 
len ratingfive The design the simplicity the ability to close issues and PRs on the go Everything 
len ratingfive The extra app icons were a great touch too 
len ratingfive  Currently rocking Rainbow Black The only thing it s missing is the ability to edit code Could be extremely useful on an iPad App hmm 
len ratingfive What already is there is great but unfortunately that s not a lot For me specially reviewing PRs and reading code leaves much to be desired Hope this gets some love
len ratingfive  Ya ll 
len ratingfive I love you 
len ratingfour Very helpful if I really need it 
len ratingfour Mostly used for PR management 
len ratingtwo should be able to approve prs fast
len ratingfour Let s be honest every developer wanted this 
len ratingfour GitHub mobile is something I ve been waiting ages for and I m very happy it s now available 
len ratingfour Plus it s in dark mode 
len ratingfour Although they could have a few improvements overall having a mobile app leaves me very happy with GitHub 
len ratingfour A few things they could add Ability to delete branches Configurable push notifications Making quick commits in app
len ratingfour Wish I could edit squash and merge message before performing merge 
len ratingfour  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfour In version you can now edit the commit title and message before merging 
len ratingfour We hope you like it 
len ratingthree With all the tech at your disposal you could create an awesome development app environment for iPad 
len ratingthree GitHub with all its features like Actions and VS Code combined into a full blown IDE would be awesome 
len ratingthree If I could load this app and do legit coding run actions for CI CD respond to issues review PRs etc 
len ratingthree all in one place I d never look for another app 
len ratingfive  A good sibling for the great web products 
len ratingone Still have signing in error while entering my credentials 
len ratingone Using iran s IP
len ratingfour Would love if you could log into the app with multiple accounts
len ratingfive This latest release has everything I asked for 
len ratingfive I am now removing all other iOS iPadOS github apps 
len ratingfive Great job guys 
len ratingfive  We just released version which contains the ability to switch to any branch in a repository 
len ratingfive Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive To disable Universal Links long press any GitHub link then tap Open in Safari 
len ratingfive Every time you tap a GitHub link in the future
len ratingfour Why can t I push any of the notifications from the notifications tab to my phone 
len ratingfour They re notifications 
len ratingfour Please add 
len ratingthree I love the app but I hope the rest of github s features will be implement within the app 
len ratingone Was so excited to finally have real GIT on the iPad 
len ratingone Accidentally logged into my old account the first time 
len ratingone Was unable to logout and login with my other newer account 
len ratingone Deleted app from iPad 
len ratingone Reinstalled and it still maintains the original old information 
len ratingone Really 
len ratingone  Sorry for the frustration logging in with another account 
len ratingone In order to change which GitHub account you login with please go to GitHub com in Safari app tap the menu icon in the header and select Sign out 
len ratingone Then try logging into the app again 
len ratingfour I really like what I have been seeing thus far but really wish there was an ability to swap between accounts 
len ratingfive Everything in here is super high quality 
len ratingfive I think GitHub did a great job 
len ratingfive I just hope milestones and projects are included in a future version 
len ratingfive This should be an idol of any iOS application 
len ratingfive It follows Apple s guidelines and makes the full use of the official interface libraries hence natural looking instant reaction and MB in size 
len ratingone Why bother producing garbage in this era of garbage 
len ratingfive  It s really a great app 
len ratingfive I wonder if you guys could add an explore feature like in github website 
len ratingfive It would also be great if we could read all md files like readme md format 
len ratingfive Added the mention completion feature 
len ratingfive Absolutely essential to discuss anything easily in an issue 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive  Version now contains suggestions for users and teams when you type in comments 
len ratingfive Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo I would like to use this app but the automatic Safari redirect makes this too painful to use 
len ratingtwo Either the redirect needs to go away or the GitHub app needs to fully support everything the desktop version of the website supports 
len ratingtwo  To disable Universal Links long press any GitHub link then tap Open in Safari 
len ratingtwo Every time you tap a GitHub link in the future the destination URL will open in Safari instead of GitHub for mobile 
len ratingfive  Hustlenmics
len ratingfour  I was extremely excited to see that Github released their own app and it s been mostly pleasant using it so far 
len ratingfour However I have had quite a few issues with timeouts and failed requests during normal use 
len ratingfour Sometimes these failed requests inspire me to try again and upon trying again and returning back to desktop I see that they didn t actually fail 
len ratingfour I m also generally unable to find pull requests as the ones shown are typically dated and don t appear to be sorted in relevant orders 
len ratingfive Nice App for Github 
len ratingfive Just one issue sometimes app get disconnected from server and cannot reconnect hopes team could make that works better in future updates 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone A message box shows there was an error signing in to Github 
len ratingone Please try again 
len ratingone What was the error 
len ratingone Can t you show the details 
len ratingone This message is helpless on debugging 
len ratingfour  Updating my review as this latest version has gotten really good however there is still a huge issue 
len ratingfour This app takes over links to github 
len ratingfour And there is no way to stop it from doing this 
len ratingfour I spend a lot of time clicking links to repos to view their changelogs which appear in releases 
len ratingfour The app does not yet show you anything in the releases tab 
len ratingfour So I end up having to uninstall to do this 
len ratingfour I would ask that they remove the url hijacking feature until all features of a repo can be seen from within the app 
len ratingfour Other than that this guy will soon make all other github apps obsolete 
len ratingfour  We just released version which contains the ability to switch to any branch in a repository 
len ratingfour Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfour To disable Universal Links long press any GitHub link then tap Open in Safari 
len ratingfour Every time you tap a GitHub link in the future
len ratingfive I would like to be able to view prior commits and what has changed in repositories especially if I don t have write access so that I can view what has happened 
len ratingfive If this were added I would increase this to stars 
len ratingfive Edit resolved this 
len ratingfour I just bumped my review from to stars 
len ratingfour With version being able to browse commit history and branches has significantly improved the utility of this app 
len ratingfour It would still be nice to see screenshots in bug reports and also search within projects you can only search all of github 
len ratingfour  We just added commit history and branches in the latest update 
len ratingfour Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive This update has brought everything we reqested 
len ratingfive I can finally ditch the other apps I was usig for git 
len ratingfive Finally a git app that does everything right 
len ratingfour I love the app 
len ratingfour The only thing I wish was possible is that seeing that I have multiple accounts saved in my Keychain I should be able to chose which account I want 
len ratingfour Also an option to switch between accounts and not just repositories 
len ratingfour If those were there it s a star for me 
len ratingtwo There is no way to edit or create any files code 
len ratingtwo Could you guys add this 
len ratingfive Most of what I wanted but was missing has been added 
len ratingfive Ability to view commits and change branches were my most required items and they are now here 
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingfive The only thing I personally would love to see in this app is the ability to edit files commit 
len ratingfive At that point I could delete all my other GitHub client apps and never need anything else again 
len ratingfive I m going to go ahead and star this for all the excellent work 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfour Would love to see links from the README lead to the files and display them correctly 
len ratingfour Right now if I click on a PDF that I have inside my repo it ll give a loading error 
len ratingfour The only way to correctly view PDFs is by clicking Browse Code and clicking into the file individually 
len ratingtwo Sure the app does provide the basic functionalities of what GitHub offers which might be good enough for an app that was just released but it needs to add more features like Project view 
len ratingtwo It might be and it probably will not that interesting yet but I can see this app growing in the future 
len ratingfive This is the app I ve been waiting forever for to interact with GitHub 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingthree This app has been long awaited and is good for a st version 
len ratingthree There is an issue accessing user profile inability to edit anything in my own source and the layout for reading the source is a bit hit or miss with the line wrapping 
len ratingthree Overall this app is living up to its name just needs a bit of work 
len ratingone  Maybe useful for comments that s it 
len ratingone Why have an app if it takes away from what github provides 
len ratingone It s a mess not for use outside personal projects 
len ratingone Yay I can change branches but no options for any real work to be done in the app 
len ratingone Too buggy personal work only if you must use this poorly implemented feature that don t perform as the web app Squash amp merge will do no good if not given the ability to properly rebase making a mess of the CHistory 
len ratingone I d use this if it did what the CLI could do but this seems like
len ratingtwo  Not bad at all for a v but unfortunately I can t use the merge feature until I have the ability to edit the commit message during squash and merge 
len ratingtwo It s actually kind of dangerous because you think it will work like the web app giving you edit ability after pressing the button and then merging on another press of confirm 
len ratingtwo However the iOS app just straight up squashes and merges leaving your with a dirty commit message on master 
len ratingtwo I would rank higher if they just didn t support squash and merge yet but since they chose to ship a broken feature that causes harm I can only give two 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo Version now has the ability to edit the commit title and message before merging 
len ratingfour I have a account of organization and another for myself 
len ratingfour It s not so convenient to switch account by just signing out and login again 
len ratingfive This app is exactly what I needed to be able to perform code reviews and merge pull requests while away from my desk 
len ratingfive Never again do I have to worry about leaving for a quick bite to eat then five minutes later getting a request for a quick review 
len ratingfive The app is solid super well designed and a real utility for me 
len ratingfive I look forward to seeing it get even better over time 
len ratingfive I ve been waiting for this app for years 
len ratingfive It s an excellent tool for code review and exploration 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingtwo If this is a mobile productivity and communication tool it s incomplete without comprehensive push notification support 
len ratingtwo Things like new issues comments on issues pull request activity etc 
len ratingtwo should all have associated notifications 
len ratingtwo Until then I m still reliant on rd party apps like CodeHub 
len ratingone When I add my credentials to sign into my account I get this error message Cookies must be enabled to use GitHub Now what 
len ratingone  Sorry for the confusion but cookies must be enabled to log into GitHub 
len ratingone You can enable cookies on your device via Settings Safari and unselecting Block All Cookies 
len ratingfour If you have been thinking of buying those other git clients 
len ratingfour Then don t this is free and official 
len ratingfour It has every feature you would like to be portable 
len ratingfour  Writing code Checking Issues etc A lot of the other issues are correct but they are based off of the website on the computer 
len ratingfour One thing the could add is looking at gists 
len ratingtwo This is a nice initial version of the app but until it s much further along it should NOT redirect github com URLs into the app 
len ratingtwo I ll probably have to uninstall this because it s maddening 
len ratingtwo  Sorry for the frustration 
len ratingtwo To disable Universal Links long press any GitHub link then tap Open in Safari 
len ratingtwo Every time you tap a GitHub link in the future the destination URL will open in Safari instead of GitHub for mobile 
len ratingone Same as the web version 
len ratingone Low star rating due to not being able to use with enterprise solutions 
len ratingone It always reports the error could not connect the server 
len ratingfour Although I always found GitHub s webapp to work just fine on mobile it s definitely nice to have a native option 
len ratingfour So far the app seems to work smoothly 
len ratingfour My only complaint is the UI aping the iOS HUI guidelines has done a disservice to the fantastic design of the web platform 
len ratingfour But other than that this is definitely GitHub 
len ratingfour And GitHub is definitely great 
len ratingfour So stars for u 
len ratingthree Needs some fixes mostly around the handling of the bottom of the display on iPhone X type screens 
len ratingtwo  As others have said being able to see the commit history and branches would significantly improve the utility of this app 
len ratingtwo Update The more I use this app the more frustrating I find it to be 
len ratingtwo I can t see screenshots in bug reports and I also cannot search within projects you can only search all of github 
len ratingtwo  We just added commit history and branches in the latest update 
len ratingtwo Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfour This is a really great move however there are some features I wish I had in the app 
len ratingfour I have submitted feedback 
len ratingfour Having options to change settings edit or even see more info about repos like the language used and such would be cool 
len ratingfour At current point there should be an option for selecting a specific branch in the repo as I cannot choose any single branch but master Check out the latest update that contains branch switch on repositories 
len ratingone With the app installed visiting any GitHub page in Safari throws you over to the app even if you didn t want to be redirected 
len ratingone Apps should never do that it s a crappy antipattern 
len ratingone  Sorry for the frustration 
len ratingone To disable Universal Links long press any GitHub link then tap Open in Safari 
len ratingone Every time you tap a GitHub link in the future the destination URL will open in Safari instead of GitHub for mobile 
len ratingfour The app is great I can open files check my favorite repos and so on but when is the moment to open an entire repo in other app I just can t literally it isn t implemented and doing that with every file is really annoying specially for bigger repos
len ratingtwo  Why 
len ratingtwo  Version now contains suggestions for users and teams when you type in comments 
len ratingtwo Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingthree The app doesn t show activity of the users I follow like the PWA does 
len ratingthree This app seems to favor the personal development experience over the user discovery experience which I don t fully understand if I want to keep close track of a repo that s having changes made to it frequently I d much rather do that on my computer than my phone 
len ratingthree I ll update my review as soon as the user activity feed is added like it is on the main site Dashboard but at this point it just feels like a MVP 
len ratingthree  As others have said being able to see the commit history and branches would significantly improve the utility of this app 
len ratingthree Excellent app for what it has so far 
len ratingthree However the biggest missing feature is support for having multiple accounts signed in at the same time and being to get notifications from each of them and swapping between them on the fly 
len ratingthree It would also be awesome if it supported multiple windows in iPadOS 
len ratingthree Being able to reference other parts of a repo in a separate window or split whole reviewing a PR without needing to fallback to Safari would be so nice 
len ratingthree I love that I can see so much in mobile now but it s not quite there yet 
len ratingthree Merging doesn t allow me to delete the branch so I still have to go to the site to click that button 
len ratingthree Code review is also missing the Viewed button and I can t collapse files or view more context around the code 
len ratingthree So for my workflows the app can t replace the site yet but I hope soon with updates it will 
len ratingfive  I ve been waiting for a first party GitHub app to be released for a VERY LONG time now and finally here it is 
len ratingfive I love this app much better than the third party ones I used before 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive  Finally a GitHub app 
len ratingfive I would like to be able to see commits though 
len ratingfive I am very grateful for this app as I use GitHub daily for my work 
len ratingfive A single App for GitHub instead of going on a browser 
len ratingfive So far everything works perfectly 
len ratingfive Bravo GitHub and Microsoft team 
len ratingfive Really liking it so far 
len ratingfive The simple interface keeps things clean 
len ratingfive I only miss the trending and explore pages 
len ratingfive In the Starred interface I hope to have a search box that can filter out my start items by searching for keywords 
len ratingfive It looks and feels like a native iOS app is focused and GitHub is responsive to feedback 
len ratingfour  I would like to be able to view prior commits and what has changed in repositories especially if I don t have write access so that I can view what has happened 
len ratingfour If this were added I would increase this to stars 
len ratingfour  I ve been eagerly awaiting the release of this for or so months now 
len ratingfour I m really enjoying having a native app to look at my code with 
len ratingfour With that being said I do have a few wishes for it 
len ratingfour I would love to be able to See my commits 
len ratingfour  See code on branches outside of the master Have some sort of lightweight editing 
len ratingfour You really can t do much coding from a phone but there are times when you spot a typo in a comment or some other trivially simple thing and how want to correct it while you re thinking about it 
len ratingfour I have CodeHub on my iPhone and it has this feature but it would be excellent if GitHub Mobile has this 
len ratingfour Overall this is a great start 
len ratingfour This is a great app thank you GitHub 
len ratingfour However as of now pdf files that are uploaded in the repository cannot be readily viewed 
len ratingfour The app returns a error 
len ratingfour Including a preview feature for pdf files would make the app even better 
len ratingfive Thank God it finally arrived 
len ratingfive I ve waited so loooong
len ratingfive  We need to either see line numbers or be able to go to a line number 
len ratingfive I went to a link that refers to a line number and it opened the app and placed me at the beginning of the file 
len ratingfive  Need to be able access our enterprise version of github 
len ratingfive Other than that this app is solid 
len ratingthree I really wanted to love this 
len ratingthree However my workplace frequently organizes PRs to be read and understood a commit at a time 
len ratingthree The ability to review PRs this way is either missing or the UI is so streamlined it s impossible to find how to do this 
len ratingthree The app overall is nice 
len ratingthree Not having projects though is a deal breaker 
len ratingthree The mobile web UI does a decent job handling it so I ll continue using it until this app has project support 
len ratingfive Being able to get push notifications on pull request updates has already been huge for my productivity 
len ratingfive Really solid app and would absolutely recommend to any developers who heavily use github already 
len ratingtwo After years of waiting some months ago you added autocomplete when mentioning a user on comments at mobile web version now makes no sense that you are not doing the same at native app version 
len ratingtwo The lack of this functionality makes me go back to mobile web version at least until to add on this app 
len ratingtwo  We just released version which contains suggestions for users and teams when you type in comments 
len ratingtwo Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone The app is decent at first blush but it hijacks links to github while being objectively worse than the webpage at presenting code 
len ratingone Given that reality it cannot remain on my device 
len ratingone  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone You can disable Universal Links for the GitHub app by long pressing on a github com link and selecting Open in Safari 
len ratingthree I just got this app 
len ratingthree The UI is really nice however I had been hoping that it would let us edit code like you can in the browser version 
len ratingthree It seems very promising as long as new features are added 
len ratingfive I would love support for Github enterprise
len ratingfive I really like the app so far 
len ratingfive My only recommendation would be to allow for repo deletion transfer etc 
len ratingfive on the app 
len ratingfive Currently we aren t really able to manage the repo at all 
len ratingfive Thrilled to see GitHub on Mobile 
len ratingfive Life has become a lot easier with this addition 
len ratingfive Official App with Dark Mode 
len ratingfour A good start 
len ratingfour The mentioning experience needs some improvement 
len ratingfour And what I really need is support for GitHub projects 
len ratingfour We use GitHub for our whole sprint management and the lack of a mobile support for projects is one of my main grievances 
len ratingtwo  I ve enjoyed the beta is no commit history a feature or a flaw 
len ratingtwo Also this is the mostly pointless for us that need the full capacity and capability of the cli 
len ratingtwo Thanks Microsoft amp GH for the efforts but this is completely missing the mark 
len ratingtwo Working copy is an example to follow 
len ratingfive  So excited for this release 
len ratingfive It s epic 
len ratingfive Finally Official app with dark mode 
len ratingfive  App 
len ratingfour App is finally here 
len ratingfour Great work 
len ratingfour So easy to open new issues and see things you are participating in 
len ratingfour I just wanted to leave the following bug report to help you out 
len ratingfour  login screen is shown times in a row on initial login after successful login rendered markdown links in readme md files do not navigate to the right page they do in the web experience That s all I have so far 
len ratingfour Otherwise great app 
len ratingone  sign in error man
len ratingfive  So this app was a blessing to me because I have a primary job away from a computer and am also a developer as a second job 
len ratingfive So whenever I need to do something I can easily do it 
len ratingthree I d like more density for the pull reviews 
len ratingthree Specially adjustable font size less room dedicated to line numbers maybe even the ability to turn them off ability to hide the review drawer
len ratingfive Good idea wait long time
len ratingfive It s OK 
len ratingfour  Omg it has been so long
len ratingfive Better than expected but takes too long to sign in
len ratingfive Now I ll never escape work 
len ratingfive Been looking forward for a mobile app for a long time it makes it much easier to stay on top of things 
len ratingfive One thing please add ability to switch between branches when viewing code it s fairly essential feature that ll cover a lot of other ground 
len ratingfive Like a PR being able to provide a link to the code
len ratingfour  Finally you can see the full README on repos
len ratingfive  Finally 
len ratingfive Once editing support is added it will be perfect 
len ratingone  there was an error signing in to github
len ratingfour It s a genuinely good app but why isn t there any support for GitHub Enterprise 
len ratingfive Fantastic 
len ratingfive I ve been waiting for this moment for a while and I m excited for what s to come 
len ratingfive This app is a great way to view repos quickly 
len ratingfive Very excited to upcoming features 
len ratingfive Finally
len ratingfour Nice done Github 
len ratingfour One quick feedback need to be able to switch branch of repo In a repository you can tap the Change button to search and select from any active branch in your repository 
len ratingfive  here we go 
len ratingfive  Excellent 
len ratingfive Just noticed this was available and after a quick tour it is quite good and has a nice clean interface 
len ratingfive  Awesome I was waiting for this app looks and works great thanks
len ratingfive Awesome availability for iOS and iPadOS is amazing 
len ratingfive We use git classrooms to manage our student s code 
len ratingfive This will enable us to use our most potable devices to do something that was only possible through the website 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive All users have been waiting for this for a while 
len ratingfive You guys blew all expectations out of the water 
len ratingfive Congrats to the GH mobile team for all of their hard work finally paying off 
len ratingfive So glad that it s finally on iOS
len ratingfour  This is a nice app but it lacks the ability to change branches 
len ratingfour It only allows access to master 
len ratingfour  We just released version which contains the ability to switch to any branch in a repository 
len ratingfour Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive  I m really glad the team over at GitHub came out with this it ll be way better than using my browser 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive First
len ratingone how to use make read and make all read Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingone You can customize the swipe actions of the app by visiting your profile and tapping the gear icon to view settings 
len ratingone From there you can set one of your swipe actions to mark read 
len ratingone We are also working on mark all notificatio
len ratingfive Does everything I would expect on a mobile interface and it all feels buttery smooth 
len ratingfive Thanks for the much desired app 
len ratingfive  wait for long
len ratingthree  Hoping they ll expand on this to enable code editing somehow
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive This will be extremely useful 
len ratingfive No more opening the laptop in bed to check the latest commit 
len ratingfive Seriously great job guys 
len ratingfive Thank you for finally making an app
len ratingone  Cannot be used with Github Enterprise there s no login option 
len ratingfive Been waiting years for the convenience of a github native mobile app way more secure then using a third party app 
len ratingfive Excited to m use this more often to track updates 
len ratingfive Can t believe I m able to sign into my organizations GitHub and see our code 
len ratingfive I can t speak yet to how everything works but just SEEING and being able to approve pull requests on mobile is worth it 
len ratingfour  Would love a way to search for functions text etc
len ratingthree There is no way to change branches We just released version which enables you to change to any branch in a repository 
len ratingthree Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive  I signed up for the beta of this app when it was first announced and it has just worked 
len ratingfive  Looks perfect acts perfect and has perfect features 
len ratingfive It looks like a native iOS app even switching the presence depending on the system setting and allowing you to change app icons 
len ratingfive Works perfectly on both non jailbroken and jailbroken devices without noticable flaws drops and is highly stable 
len ratingfive It s always good when the official client is the best client 
len ratingfive  Fries 
len ratingfive First run thru I love it 
len ratingfive UI is beautiful and it has the features youd want in a V
len ratingfive  daniel wotapka en desk
len ratingfive After months of waiting it s finally out 
len ratingfive And it works great 
len ratingfive Wouldn t expect anything less from the GitHub team 
len ratingfive  Great App 
len ratingfive Browsing Github on a mobile phone used to be a pain now it s a lot easier 
len ratingfour  In contains almost all git hub features But there is no pull request creation I hope we can create pull requests soon
len ratingfour  I ve enjoyed the beta is no commit history a feature or a flaw 
len ratingfour Thanks Microsoft amp GH for the efforts 
len ratingfive Finally 
len ratingfive Thank you Github 
len ratingfive It s great to see first class support for mobile from Github 
len ratingfive Push notifications are very helpful for keeping track of my projects 
len ratingfive READMEs look great and I m impressed at how good complex READMEs can render for example large tables or figures are scrollable and look nicer than in the browser 
len ratingfive It s also great to be able to look at code on my device 
len ratingfive The code previewer is disappointingly barebones however syntax highlighting looks great but there are no line numbers 
len ratingfive and from what I can see there are only two themes Light and Dark 
len ratingfive I d love to be able to import VScode BBedit Sublime themes into the app in which case I would use it all the time for light repo surfing 
len ratingfive Also code always wraps to a new line this destroys any stylistic use of white space 
len ratingfive Additionally text wrapping could be very confusing when looking at code in white space aware languages such as python or YAML 
len ratingfive In most scenarios I would prefer to scroll left right for longer lines 
len ratingfive That being said this is still an improvement over the web experience and I look forward to improvements over the coming months 
len ratingfive Hats off to GH Microsoft for putting in the work 
len ratingfive Love that this app exists I ve been anticipating its arrival for quite some time 
len ratingfive It has a good chunk of basic functionality 
len ratingfive A few suggested improvements I would love to be able to see code line numbers and to link to them as can be done on web It doesn t seem like line numbers are currently considered on links to specific line numbers right now It would be nice to see what branch commit hash you re on while browsing a file
len ratingfive  Perfect 
len ratingfive It s finally here
len ratingfive  Finally I can respond to requests and search repositories on the go 
len ratingfive There are a lot of Github iOS apps out there 
len ratingfive Although this one seems promising 
len ratingfive I am still checking out the features but this seems to do well 
len ratingfive  First to rate this and off the bat it looks awesome 
len ratingfive  I think it s great there s an official app now and I look forward to use it 
len ratingfive Stay healthy 
len ratingfive  I ve been waiting FOREVER for a GitHub mobile app 
len ratingfive Thank you GitHub 
len ratingthree I m looking forward to using this app 
len ratingthree Before I can though I need it to support multiple accounts 
len ratingthree Also GitHub Enterprise account support is necessary 
len ratingthree Thanks for creating it 
len ratingthree I ll stay tuned 
len ratingfive GitHub managed to build out a highly useful and easy to use app 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingfive  finally you are here 
len ratingfive I m so happy It even has a dark mode 
len ratingfive Now we can finally look at and approve pull request on the go 
len ratingthree I open the app and I find I must kitty tap often as it s made for the iPhone but not iPad 
len ratingthree It is faster in performance but slower in workflow 
len ratingthree Okay start gets okay score 
len ratingfive  Beta version but still very smooth
len ratingfive  great
len ratingfive After years of waiting we finally got the Github app 
len ratingfive  Very fluid app I was lucky to be a part of the beta test for the application 
len ratingfive Enjoyed it thoroughly as a developer I was able to comment on commits and issues and review code
len ratingfive  Great app waited a while just for this 
len ratingfive  finally 
len ratingthree Haven t find the bnt for this We just released version which enables you to change to any branch in a repository 
len ratingthree Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive Awesome stuff team iOS at Github 
len ratingfive I ve been eagerly awaiting the native official GitHub app for years 
len ratingfive Hooray 
len ratingfive Long awaited and super well made 
len ratingfive Cheers
len ratingfive Was waiting for the official app to come out for a long time 
len ratingfive So far no issues and works like a charm 
len ratingfive Initial commit May be st review for github app 
len ratingfive Finally
len ratingfive Much needed for me to easily go through some issues and quick code reviews 
len ratingfive Clean UI but waiting for improvements 
len ratingfive Overall it s a pretty solid app 
len ratingfive I really like how snappy it is and the apps design scheme 
len ratingfive I wish there was a way to see the commit history 
len ratingfive When looking at source files I wish there was a way to turn off text reflow along with simple text editing for small corrections 
len ratingfive I also wish I could see the commit tree 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive FINALLY 
len ratingfive Love it so far
len ratingfive I ve been using this app since the day it launched in preview and it s become an essential tool for everyone maintaining a project on GitHub 
len ratingfive I can conveniently manage issues on GitHub projects on the go look at pull requests check the source code of an app and more 
len ratingfive Still need to get used to the GUI but interesting to check and manage your repositories via smartphone 
len ratingfive It s been a long time I ve been waiting for it 
len ratingfive I ve been using GitHub iOS for months and love the interface 
len ratingfive It s easy to browse code issues and PRs 
len ratingfive Sweet baby Jesus this app is nice 
len ratingfive Responsive logical layout and pretty decent features for a first version 
len ratingfive Hey Microsoft 
len ratingfive I d love to see a built in editor VS Code like in future versions 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive Great app so far though would love to see support for multiple GitHub accounts 
len ratingfive I have been waiting for this app since day one I signed up for the beta but never got the link so I waited until was official 
len ratingfive The app is great 
len ratingfive Super fast to load your repos and watch code I mean it super fast 
len ratingfive But at certain point the app just quits 
len ratingfive I have tried a couple of times but it keeps happening 
len ratingfive Again overall the app is awesome 
len ratingfive Thank you Github for this 
len ratingfive I love being able to keep up with all things on my GitHub while I m mobile 
len ratingfive Definitely a game changer 
len ratingfive Simple yet as powerful as you want it to be 
len ratingfive Useful
