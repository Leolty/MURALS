len ratingfive Love the app I use it daily for work fever miss beat love it
len ratingfive TEAM S is easy to maneuver in 
len ratingfive It s a fast start up and is a very user friendly app 
len ratingfive The only thing negative I will say is that there needs to more choices for background solutions 
len ratingtwo For some reason it won t let me change my initials to a avatar or another picture 
len ratingtwo I change it but it does not change on my phone or computer 
len ratingthree I wish Teams had the same filters and makeup application as Zoom 
len ratingthree People look more attractive on Zoom 
len ratingfive App is good but need scheduling to auto change Status from Available to Away or vise versa
len ratingtwo After a year continue to get this error 
len ratingtwo Why can t this be resolved 
len ratingfive Fantastic and enjoyable
len ratingfive Was a bit resistant at first but now loving the Teams app 
len ratingfive Teams makes it easy to see what meetings I had in the past and how long they lasted 
len ratingfive This is great for billing as a contractor 
len ratingfive The IM function and meeting reminders are definitely a plus 
len ratingfive But what I think is the most value is that there is an easy Join This Meeting button that allows you to quickly join a meeting without needing to find it on your calendar or email 
len ratingfive I find the Teams app for iPhone so easy to use and fast 
len ratingfive And a lot more convenient than the desktop app 
len ratingfive It s already been such a solid workspace from the beginning 
len ratingfive But now the intuitiveness fluidity and suggestions help you respond faster to colleagues and get back to work 
len ratingfive Wonderful interface too 
len ratingfive Totally customizable 
len ratingfive Thanks for adding OUT OF OFFICE in settings 
len ratingfive  Ryan K 
len ratingone This is such a crucial function why hasn t it been implemented Also there needs to be a way to more easily monitor announce and share things to all rooms
len ratingone This app has drove me crazy and made me want to cry please get this app deleted cus my teacher is a stick in my butt
len ratingfive Liked it alot when working with team mates
len ratingfive I found Teams working very well both on laptop and on iPhone 
len ratingfive Even switching call between iPhone and laptop is very easy without any interruptions 
len ratingfive It s amazing 
len ratingone I have submitted this bug and repro several time 
len ratingone It s been present for over months 
len ratingone Please Fix it 
len ratingone Basically when you tap a notification you go into an endless loop of switching accounts 
len ratingone This app has my email and login info entered and it will not allow me to log in 
len ratingone Just in a constant state of loading 
len ratingone Teams was laggy and didn t have any true learning options
len ratingthree Wish we can open multiple files on teams at the same time 
len ratingfive It has great tools to keep me connected with my organization
len ratingfour The mobile team app works well on the IPhone 
len ratingfour This App is really important to being able to communicate with team members while being on the plant floor or other places without my laptop 
len ratingfour The biggest issue the app has is that sometimes it can be a little finicky when trying to join a teams call but usually closing the call and rejoining fixes the issue 
len ratingfour I think that if you have the Teams computer application for business that the mobile app is a critical extension to the program that every team member should download ASAP 
len ratingfive When someone calls on teams it seems like it s a normal phone call 
len ratingfive That s my definition of success 
len ratingone  Teams is pretty broken more than any other messaging service I have every used 
len ratingone Delayed messages floating alerts with no attached message formatting code and cut and paste text color being illegible are common issues 
len ratingone Please use hangouts slack or maybe just send me a letter via usps 
len ratingfive This is a great tool for everyone 
len ratingfive We love it 
len ratingone Did you guys delete messages from this version 
len ratingfive I love Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive SO easy to use and SO many features 
len ratingfive I m not very techy and even I find it easy to use but I m sure I don t know even of everything it will do 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingone Que feo 
len ratingone I ahte teams its stoppid i am im bad plz stopydoppy dis maddness dadness i want to die plz i hate teams its killing meee help mee i wanna dieeeeee no no i hate it It brings me pain Its cillolng me Chemotherapy Therappyyy Yeeeeee I keedd my soul tonight but teams irs taling it awayyyytyt nudes are stupid like teams wtfffff
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive It s getting better than slack 
len ratingfive Team is much better on video calls and screen sharing 
len ratingfour Entering tasks is slightly clunky and difficult to understand some of the functionality of tasks 
len ratingfive It s everything I could have hoped for
len ratingone I ve had teams on my phone before and this is shown when I go to download because it has the little cloud icon 
len ratingone Still running the same iPhone and my version is up to date or newer than the system requirements here 
len ratingone I have no way to uninstall Teams because it s not downloaded or remove it from my apple account and when I try to confirm purchase with my credentials it loads indefinitely and makes the Apps application unresponsive 
len ratingone I m not sure how I m supposed to fix 
len ratingtwo Whenever I see notification and click on the banner 
len ratingtwo The app keeps flickering and I had to close the app and then restart to check my messages
len ratingfive I have used Teams to coordinate school projects and now in my professional career 
len ratingfive It s very easy for communicating with other team members with the formality of email 
len ratingfive I am a big fan 
len ratingfive I take advantage of the gifs feature and use it to lighten up all my conversations something you can t do over email 
len ratingfive It s also easy to share files and create specialized teams within the to platform to help you stay organized 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Worked at several companies and this is the best app for messaging 
len ratingfive Super useful 
len ratingfive Very convenient and efficient way of communication 
len ratingfive I like it very much 
len ratingfive Thanks for the awesome product 
len ratingfive Teams is so easy to use and navigate 
len ratingfive I work for a large company so it s quicker to send someone a quick chat than to try getting them on a quick phone call 
len ratingfive I can have multiple chats going at once if I need to 
len ratingfive I also use it when I conference with my kids teachers 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive You make my days easier 
len ratingfour I only did stars because you can t block anyone and you should be able to
len ratingtwo PLEASE THE OTHER PERSON ON THE CALL CANT HEAR ME PLEASE FIXIT
len ratingtwo I can be sign in for a few days and it sign me out and I can t get back in
len ratingone Teams just got shut down and bring it back
len ratingone BAD APP WHAT WAS THE POINT OF REMOVING THE CHATS NO REASON FOR REMOVING TEAM CHATS
len ratingthree This is a great app but the calendar only going out week is useless 
len ratingone No
len ratingfive I work at an MEP engineering firm 
len ratingfive This app works perfect for us since half of us are in the office and the other half work remote 
len ratingfive It works well for meetings and it s an easy way to share files and screen shots while we coordinate our projects 
len ratingone Make a widget so Teams can remain active otherwise it goes idle 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this app I use it for my startup and for my employer 
len ratingfive Also used it for my sons virtual school 
len ratingfive This is definitely the anytime anywhere any circumstances Teams is the app 
len ratingthree Teams is a great productivity tool but muting chats on your phone is the most useless function ever 
len ratingthree As I type this a meeting that I am missing is causing notification after notification interfering with the review screen 
len ratingthree I had pressed Mute and it warns you that it will be muted until the next post 
len ratingthree That accomplishes nothing 
len ratingthree Muting no activity and letting through the activity I am TRYING to mute accomplishes nothing 
len ratingone another day another slay period 
len ratingfour Love how engagement and access to team is readily available 
len ratingone The beeping tone when muting unmuting while in a call is VERY distracting for both me as a user and for others on the call 
len ratingone PLEASE change this 
len ratingfive Most places are rolling out Teams with little to no training I use Teams 
len ratingfive We have meetings all the time 
len ratingfive There is so much to learn and use in the application that there needs to be ongoing training 
len ratingfive It is highly powerful for collaboration integration and efficiency 
len ratingone  Teams flopped
len ratingone If I didn t like it I wouldn t be using it 
len ratingone Your review prompt interruptions make you look petty and waste my time 
len ratingone Stop it 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive I can stay in touch at all times in a second 
len ratingone I was on a call and I changed the voice setting to speakerphone so my colleague could hear it 
len ratingone After I turned it off speakerphone I put my phone to my ear and it was STILL ON 
len ratingfour Since our company implemented Microsoft and teams it s been very easy to communicate with others 
len ratingfour I really enjoy using teams 
len ratingfour The only improvement it needs is the ability to call in to the meetings 
len ratingfive Loving this platform to communicate 
len ratingone Trying to log in on my phone as my company has switched over to teams and I keep getting an error 
len ratingone I tried all the tricks I found online and still nothing 
len ratingone Uninstalled And unhappy 
len ratingfive Absolutely Perfect 
len ratingfour It is a great app but develop watch app too
len ratingtwo  On mobile it s just very buggy and sometimes it doesn t even show if a meeting starts you have to scroll up very high and then scroll down to show if the meeting started or not at least it has a good connection and also in the meeting leave button the red one often lags when you click it 
len ratingone En las asignaciones no me deja entrar
len ratingone If you re having issues you will get no support 
len ratingone I m currently trapped with an office account and I can not cancel it or get a refund on it 
len ratingfour We are heavily rely on teams for our meetings and me as a none native speaker found the live subtitle really helpful 
len ratingfour But recently notice that this function is unebled by organizer because if one person in the team turn on that function it shows up for everyone and somebody find it not so comfortable or self conscious 
len ratingfour So 
len ratingfour It is possible that we show a icon to acknowledge the team that someone is using the live subtitle instead of broadcast the substitute to everyone 
len ratingfour I believe you guys have better solutions to make this inclusive tool more usable 
len ratingfive Almost all the functionality of the desktop
len ratingfive I wish teams allow you to clear a chat easily or in bulk 
len ratingone having used this app awhile for work both in the browser and the iOS app my take is that its eclectic traits quirks and missteps are what is typical of both MS and Skype software if there s another option recommend choosing that instead and better options are easy to find from Google to Jitsi 
len ratingfive Easy to use which says so much given the number of features packed into the app 
len ratingfour Connection only has minor issues depending on personal at home modem internet speed etc 
len ratingfour great voice and video for interview of candidate content needed 
len ratingone What s the purpose of using and it s crashing 
len ratingone Mind you I m trying to attend court using this app 
len ratingone terrible
len ratingone He delete all my works and she stay freeze like a stupid it s so bad this I don t liked deleted
len ratingfive We can t function without Teams
len ratingfour  Communications collaboration document sharing and app integration all at the fingertips 
len ratingfour In many ways this is ahead of the desktop version 
len ratingfour Supporting personal accounts is welcome and now a must have but still feature incomplete compared to business Teams 
len ratingfour Apple CarPlay support is still subpar 
len ratingone This app is pathetic 
len ratingone The last thing you want to do when signing on to a group call is be forced to jump through a bunch of hoops 
len ratingone I have NEVER had a MS Teams call start on time because inevitably one person was forced to download the app something Zoom does not require or sort out a sign on to a Microsoft account also something Zoom avoids 
len ratingone I m a former Microsoft employee and despite my loyalty I think this product is crap and refuse to use it ever again
len ratingfive Teams came out of nowhere in my work environment 
len ratingfive Since the switch from Skype to Teams communication in our facility as become streamlined and easier 
len ratingfive I could not ask for a better program
len ratingone It doesn t let me open links or my own pictures I send of homework
len ratingfive But teams comes close 
len ratingfive I think it is our corporate deployment that prevents external communication which is the only major drawback I see
len ratingfive Great feature
len ratingfour Wish I could text through it
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Subject line says it all
len ratingfive Actually prefer this to the desktop version 
len ratingfive Very well done 
len ratingthree There are bugs issues all the time 
len ratingthree Today the issue is cut paste I take a snip and paste it in my chat with someone I can t see it once it s sent but the receiver can 
len ratingthree I also don t receive them 
len ratingthree I also wish you have the option of turning off notifications when you leave a group 
len ratingthree So it s not perfect but it is functional 
len ratingone So frustrating 
len ratingone Unfortunately my employer uses this app so I am stuck with it for now 
len ratingfive Brought revolution in how we used to interact with different teams online 
len ratingone I am going to make it my personal campaign to get as many folks to give a one star review as possible simply based on Team incapabilities with Apple based products 
len ratingone Safari and notes no copy paste 
len ratingone This petty corporate competition and it s killing your user experience with the platform 
len ratingone Fix it or I ll create the petition and campaign against Teams 
len ratingone Wish I could give zero stars 
len ratingone What a waste of your users time and effort 
len ratingone This is a business centered design that only considers Microsoft s business interests and internal numbers 
len ratingfive Will be better if they can also add the direct reply feature to the desktop version
len ratingfive I ve been asking for this format for meetings for years 
len ratingfive I m so glad those of us who work nights have the opportunity to participate in these dayshift meetings 
len ratingfive Especially when I work the night before and then work the night of 
len ratingfive it s my in between shift 
len ratingfive I cannot stay an extra Hours drive home fall asleep wake up and then come back to work 
len ratingfive So this has been so helpful this year and last year 
len ratingfive It has to be the most I ve ever participated in meetings because usually they do fall on days where I m working 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Versatile 
len ratingfive No glitches
len ratingone I work for a global company and get occasional invites for calls hours ahead of me 
len ratingone Even though I decline the call the app is closed and I have do not disturb on at night and I have muted and hidden the related group Teams will still blow up with notifications from the meeting chat at AM 
len ratingone Seriously Teams take a hint 
len ratingone I obviously don t care about this call and definitely don t my phone buzzing and lighting up in the middle of the night for it
len ratingone This product is a landmark achievement for this year 
len ratingone The UI reflects the modern age of this time 
len ratingone I just love how the whole program feels like a forum with nested comments that can go on well forever 
len ratingone The amount of customization is also incredible 
len ratingone Microsoft has released two beautiful custom themes light and amazingly dark 
len ratingone Will the ability to customize this product ever end 
len ratingone The only downside is the recent competitor AOL Instant Messenger 
len ratingone I m a bit nervous it might dethrone this kingly application 
len ratingfour Ok so I like teams and all but I have the iOS and I putted a cloud on it cuz it was vacation and I tried to reinstall it but it didn t work so I don t know what happened i clear ed all of my memory but still no luck BUT I heard something when I was in teams please update this iPad we will no longer support iOS And I ignored it DONT ask and I went to google wrote does teams support iOS But I found nothing useless google and when I always reinstall it always said unable to download item please try again so I hope some one will tell me about this Yea so I hope they will respond cuz I m scared Bc my mother is gonna kill me I am PRAYING FOR SCHOOL TO BE GONE cuz I m still doing this reinstall thing this is a story now PEACE 
len ratingfour  D Tell me if I did something wrong cuz I don t know 
len ratingfour  old message uhm it works now BUT ITS STILL STARS I mean if it still didn t work heh Well it s a stars 
len ratingone So annoying it keeps prompting me to re receive text messages and enter code 
len ratingone It s the same phone I ve been logged into for years 
len ratingone How does it make it more secure to make me enter text message code again and again 
len ratingone The app REQUIRES your name email and cell phone number it will verify and also access to your microphone and camera 
len ratingone I drew the line at cell phone number no reason to have it other than to sell it 
len ratingfive Intuitive platform very versatile especially with the ability to pickup wherever you left off with whatever device or medium you re logged into 
len ratingone Using teams for work requires the Authenticator App to log in but the Authenticator app pop up message is preventing me from seeing the number I need to type in 
len ratingone I keep pressing hide but it just keeps popping up 
len ratingone If I m lucky I could get a glimpse of the number 
len ratingone This is an awful experience 
len ratingthree Problem I have is with screen sharing 
len ratingthree It s awful 
len ratingthree Very difficult to use it when you need to manage someone s computer 
len ratingthree Lots odd hesitancy and sometimes it just stops working 
len ratingthree Plus the user s abilities seem to be restricted 
len ratingone I ve been trying to log in but the app just spins and freezes me out of any controls 
len ratingone The desktop app is sluggish at times but not like this 
len ratingone At the moment this app is simply useless 
len ratingone Won t let me view new messages for over a day 
len ratingone I tried deleting the app and redownoading it 
len ratingone Now it won t even let me login 
len ratingone Calls timing that bypass quiet hours and bypass iOS unknown caller block and bypass Do Not Disturb settings 
len ratingone I am irate 
len ratingone It is harassment 
len ratingfive Fouduxhkdkdououdiyfi
len ratingone There s a glitch every day
len ratingfour This has been outpaced all its competitors 
len ratingfour Getting very hang of it in Agile environment across IT 
len ratingfive Works great but sad there is no Apple Watch app as well 
len ratingfive I like this app because when I miss school I can do my work on here and don t have to worry about extra work
len ratingthree There is no way to sort files alphabetically 
len ratingthree HELLO MICROSOFT these are teams 
len ratingthree Teams have lots of FILES 
len ratingthree It s totally INSANE to only show files dozens of people might use in last accessed order 
len ratingthree It s IMPOSSIBLE to find files easily using the app 
len ratingthree If you mixed SharePoint file access and Teams file access you d have a single decent app 
len ratingthree Individually both are lacking 
len ratingfour Overall very useful but I m forever dismissing phantom notifications 
len ratingfour Please fix it 
len ratingone Is broken half of the time takes up large space on my phone assignments usually don t turn in and long waiting for loading 
len ratingone Also don t send your kids to CCA in Paducah ky
len ratingtwo Recent iOS update requires to grant the app permission to scan local network in order to make receive voice calls or join conference meetings 
len ratingtwo No other communication app requires that permission 
len ratingfive Easy and user friendly
len ratingtwo This app is actually pretty good 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately if you need to take Teams calls hear messages etc and you have CarPlay it is absolutely terrible 
len ratingtwo Instead of reading your messages joining a meeting or any other behavior you would expect it simply says who would you like to call 
len ratingfour  The new blue color on iPhones for messages is too blue please revert it back to the previous color 
len ratingone But what choice do we have 
len ratingfour Useful going back and forth from computer to the app on a cell phone 
len ratingfour Although status are not always up to date on the app for people 
len ratingfive More companies should use this platform this tool can be use for simply ways to communicate and share documents while at the same time serve a more robust need 
len ratingfive Microsoft you guys have to figure out more ways to reach and educate people on social media with tricks and hacks on Teams share point Delve etc 
len ratingfive Make free workshops for small business owners 
len ratingfive Have certified trainers to teach courses 
len ratingfive Good luck 
len ratingfive One of my favorite apps in my phone super helpful and easy to use 
len ratingfive I work and travel so having this app on my phone really helps me keep my self on track for my meetings 
len ratingfive Absolutely love it 
len ratingfive This is what everybody is using for business meetings for a reason 
len ratingfive It s a great app that s easy to use 
len ratingthree App freezes on last three version of IOS I have uses 
len ratingthree Outlook app does the same thing and phone needs power cycled to correct 
len ratingthree Don t know if it s Microsoft or IOS issue but frustrating for the end user 
len ratingthree After updating to iOS and updating the app my status goes immediately into away mode when my phone goes dark 
len ratingthree I assure everyone I m still here 
len ratingthree Hope this gets fixed soon 
len ratingone  Depressions
len ratingone This app had been working well within my organization which is a healthcare organization 
len ratingone We often use it for somewhat urgent types of communication as well 
len ratingone Recently after I updated to IOS my notifications stopped coming through 
len ratingone Many of my employees and coworkers are having the same issue 
len ratingone I have an old iPad I dug out and logged into teams and it works there so it has to be a version issue 
len ratingone Apple please fix this 
len ratingfive The mobile version is just as easy as the desktop version 
len ratingthree mGreat app only thing missing is texting abilities
len ratingone Fs
len ratingone Once you enter in a new chat mode there is no way out to cancel it 
len ratingone Which means no way to go back to the list of chats no matter if you close or even logout 
len ratingone This is totally annoying 
len ratingone I left a feedback earlier with screenshots never heard back 
len ratingone Leaving a public comment this time
len ratingfour Ticks all the right boxes to be a solid productivity hub for large corporates 
len ratingfour SharePoint integration means setting up dedicated spaces for particular projects and management thereof is relatively easy 
len ratingfour Only gripe is the drain on resources 
len ratingfour Now about giving Skype a decent update 
len ratingfive Great with meeting and group study
len ratingfive This is the App we use daily for our routine clinic work flow 
len ratingfive We cannot work smoothly without it 
len ratingfive Stable and reliable 
len ratingone App not loading after updating it today
len ratingfour  Posts are getting cut off in teams channels with no option to scroll to see the rest of them on Teams version iPhone OS version 
len ratingfour Not responsive on most devices even Windows computers 
len ratingfive I really like Teams because it lets me talk to my friends and my family 
len ratingfive It also lets you call and text 
len ratingfive You can also send Emojis they are a little different from the regular ones 
len ratingfive Easy to use on mobile
len ratingone Microsoft says the last Teams update included performance improvements 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone Teams is now slower than ever 
len ratingone Buenas porfavor arreglen los problemas de la aplicaci n 
len ratingone  no me deja entrar cuando entro a la aplicaci n y aveces ni cuando me mandan el link de una reuni n 
len ratingthree I am downloading the update right now so i don t know if this is addressed yet but I don t like that I can t schedule anything or see anything in the Calendar on the app further than week out 
len ratingthree I have reoccurring appointments every week and I can t schedule non reoccurring appointments if I can t see the next week 
len ratingfive So epic app 
len ratingfive Woohoo yaaa
len ratingthree Search option in the all messages or in specific person logs
len ratingfive I like this app I put stars and if I have to say something against it I would say it is kind of annoying to set up 
len ratingfive HaahAHAha there is nothing else 
len ratingfive I like how it is layer out neat and there aren t endless tags covering up words tho I haven t written swear words and it would probably block that but I have no idea 
len ratingfive This may or may not be helpful but at least I write a lot 
len ratingfive  I D O
len ratingone App insists on Local Network permissions 
len ratingone There is absolutely no reason for this aside from data mining to probe what devices the user has 
len ratingone Blocking basic Internet functions like a video call when both other Teams versions and competitor products can work without this violation is unwarranted and disingenuous 
len ratingfive Really Supa cool app but is there a way to have it mute by default I seem to get in trouble because when I select audio on the microphone is unmuted 
len ratingfive We work in Aviation and sometimes the our meetings taken mobile 
len ratingfive Easy to use im glad that you can access Teams from Outlook
len ratingtwo It will not let me call
len ratingthree Like all things Microsoft Teams is difficult to maneuver in unless you know what to do 
len ratingthree You can t just jump in and use it as I m finding out 
len ratingthree I m sure it s a great resource but I don t know if I have the time or patience to learn it 
len ratingfive Works very well and allows me to connect with my team often without problems I love the app it s super convenient and genius 
len ratingfive Such a good app I use it for school
len ratingfive It s super easy to use with all your other Microsoft products and can add them as tabs 
len ratingone Won t show the classes I m in 
len ratingfour Both on MacOS and iPadOS whenever I and my coworkers update their profile picture it is not properly displayed when using the app I can only see the updated picture when clicking on my own profile or when clicking on other s profile during a call 
len ratingfour The only piece I do not care for is the calendar when I need to join a call 
len ratingfour It appears as a list and I would prefer the option to view it in a three day calendar view like outlook
len ratingone Have only basic reaction emojis 
len ratingone If you can add more reactions on message image that would be great
len ratingfour Very good convenient to get on 
len ratingfour Only drawback is it keeps having to be download it again due to unable to access bring up team when needed
len ratingfive Very user friendly 
len ratingfive Has most of the features needed for a conference 
len ratingfour I would like to have my own notifications sounds
len ratingone Kh ng h nh n c th ng b o n o khi tho t ra kh i app khi n t i b l nh ng vi c quan tr ng 
len ratingone C p nh t Nh ng bu i h p m i kh ng c t ng c p nh t m t r t l u t t m 
len ratingfive This platform allows our team to work across an entire continent and stay in communication share files schedules and even online meetings 
len ratingfive Ties in nicely with outlook 
len ratingfive One of Microsoft s best programs 
len ratingthree It s pretty good at IMs and offering broader productivity tools integrations but sometimes lacks basic voice and video qualities compared to Zoom or Webex 
len ratingfive This is a great tool that I use to communicate with my colleagues and clients 
len ratingfive Before one of the previous updates Teams used to show how long you were on the phone or in a meeting but now it just shows what time you began the call 
len ratingfive It would be very helpful to return this logging especially for those who have to log their activity 
len ratingfive I have been using Teams for almost two years and I love it 
len ratingfive User friendly and convenient for meeting as well 
len ratingtwo Will not allow me to dial out to bring then in to Join a meeting 
len ratingtwo Only the PC version works 
len ratingtwo On the iPad or iphone app you are only able to enter a number but there is no where to hit dial and you are stuck 
len ratingfour Makes conversations more entertaining for the next ten 
len ratingfour Good way to bridge that gap between generations 
len ratingfour The problem is it is a separate app from work most of the other people I work with do not know how to communicate on several different platforms
len ratingone  doesn t provide meaningful information for why the messaging works yet calls don t without local network access profiling browser doesn t work authenticator stops working unless you agree to terms what terms 
len ratingone were they available to understand 
len ratingone  app across interfaces is usually out of sync overall my perspective is this app provides the weakest performance and experience in the industry get lost in the maze of generated links quirky uis somehow the text message traffic works and the video audio requires specific network permissions other applications do not super corporate though so the larger orgs seem to love it despite there appearing to be better alternatives 
len ratingone I imagine this attributable to sales teams and lack of experience with those customers from a working fairly ignorant perspective this app comes across as just straight up super creepy in my experience google s equivalent and jitsi both are far better
len ratingfour It s a great app I just don t know if there is an option to delete messages in your personal messages 
len ratingthree Love the all but wish I wouldn t get notifications on my phone when I m also on my computer
len ratingtwo This is the most disappointing Office app Microsoft has produced 
len ratingtwo Missing important features like the ability to edit Wikis
len ratingfour  If you take the time to understand the relationship between Teams and other Microsoft apps you ll find the Teams app to be great 
len ratingfour You can go from desktop to mobile to tablet and keep your workflow goin 
len ratingone Stupidly designed 
len ratingone Slack is so much better 
len ratingthree Suddenly i found my self cant sign in into my business account from my iphone amd I tried several iPhones of my family and friends and same error message but i sign in normally from android 
len ratingone Slowly connect
len ratingfour alo sao t nhin l i z m th cx c tui thik l m tuy t z i
len ratingfive You can get all of your work turned in on the app and you can text with your friends and teachers on a school app 
len ratingone just because of you i take online classes 
len ratingone thanks teams 
len ratingfive Great app other than the fact that I am typing this without seeing any letters right now
len ratingtwo Files in excel and powerpoint need to be open in the software app as teams run programs with limited capabilities 
len ratingtwo Then when or colleagues are working on the same file MST doesn t save all your changes ending in a frustrating collaboration experience 
len ratingtwo Ends worst than Share Point 
len ratingfour Sometimes it crashes and need to reboot 
len ratingfour Volume dosa not come sometimes 
len ratingone Team is so laggy and have lot of unnecessary features and heavy and laggy it hard to use and slow
len ratingthree We still need alphabetical sorting of chat contacts 
len ratingthree I can t believe this isn t a thing yet 
len ratingthree Also please let the app remember which chat contact groups we have expanded or collapsed 
len ratingthree I would rate this app with almost stars if those changes were made 
len ratingfive It s been a great feature to get text immediately from co workers so we stay on the same page 
len ratingfive Which in turn helps us take care of guest up to par and beyond 
len ratingfour Only nerds gave this five stars
len ratingfive Makes my work easier
len ratingfour Text won t render correctly when shared from slides 
len ratingfour Please fix this issue 
len ratingfive This is really great
len ratingfive Works well 
len ratingfive Messaging with pictures is great
len ratingone Nightmare to use nightmare to make a Microsoft account 
len ratingfive EXCELLENT AS THE DESKTOP APP 
len ratingfive Teams is the best tool ever 
len ratingfive Communications with people and ability to talk listen and see in real time 
len ratingfive Best tool in my tool bag 
len ratingfive Jim Westernmidstream
len ratingone The fact that this feature wasn t included in the very first iteration of teams blows my mind 
len ratingone I can t imagine why anyone would design a calendar without the most basic features that come standard in any decent calendar software 
len ratingone Additionally the app logs me out during critical communications 
len ratingfive This app is amazing best communication through front desk in groups and individuals 
len ratingfive Nothing is ever missed we just love it 
len ratingthree When I move around the house it drops and redials into my meeting frequently 
len ratingthree Why 
len ratingfive Great insights 
len ratingone I am able to access the Teams from the desktop but when I try the app it says no license 
len ratingfour This is more a request than a review 
len ratingfour Overall if you work in a Teams Environment it does the job 
len ratingfour My request is I would like the ability to set mobile notification setting in the app and am requesting specifically to be able to select all by channel and direct mentions only on mobile 
len ratingfour When I am in the office I do not need notifications on my phone only when I am not in the office 
len ratingfive These app is good but I can t upload video
len ratingfive  After the latest update there is still an issue where all long posts in our channels in Teams gets cut off only can see some of it with no option to scroll down when looking at posts through the mobile app 
len ratingfive Update still unable to delete messages with hyperlinks sent on via the mobile app 
len ratingfive I work for an international finance company with k employees 
len ratingfive Teams always works 
len ratingfive love this app on iphone and ipad side by side the same as on desktop 
len ratingfive I can get lots of work and effective communication done 
len ratingfive I was so thankful at first when I opened it up on how well it works and makes using it a BREEZE
len ratingfour I have only one screen and while presenting I can t see other participants but only my presentation 
len ratingfour usually I have to start the same call on the other device to see people 
len ratingfour I find it very uncomfortable
len ratingfive I like when there are no bugs in the app 
len ratingfive Using Teams over a year now and had no bugs so far 
len ratingfive I use this app for work and it has great quality and features that allow working from home to be a breeze 
len ratingone We use Teams in our organization however it s very slow on iPhone 
len ratingone Sometimes it might take several minutes to load recent received messages 
len ratingone It looks like this I receive notification that someone wrote a message 
len ratingone I click on it and chat window pops up however I see only old messages 
len ratingone New ones aren t there 
len ratingone There is no progress indicator of loading and it s hard to understand what is going on 
len ratingone It s very frustrating 
len ratingone After several minutes I receive new messages only 
len ratingone Similar thing when I try to start a chat 
len ratingone I tap to message someone and nothing happens 
len ratingone If I tap many times then many windows will pop up after several min 
len ratingone These are very annoying bugs 
len ratingone It looks like a sloppy implementation 
len ratingone It s hard to believe that these bugs exist for many versions of Teams 
len ratingone Also it s not an internet issue since it s as fast as Mbit of actual download speed higher on PC and very low latencies as well 
len ratingthree I will say it s ok because I was doing my homework on teams and then it just deleted EVERYTHING 
len ratingthree And my homework was do that day and got a because it deleted it all
len ratingfive Are you constantly on the go and rarely in front of your computer 
len ratingfive Well then the teams mobile app is for you 
len ratingfive It includes many of the features as the desktop version including chat teams news feed and even video conferencing without even needing to log into an actual computer 
len ratingfive Works great with an iPhone and an iPad 
len ratingfive I can do almost anything on the mobile version that I can do on the desktop 
len ratingfive They also made transferring to and from seamless 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Gets away from the same of emails 
len ratingfive It s intuitive 
len ratingone  Bad 
len ratingtwo The app was great at first and over the last six months it is close to unusable 
len ratingtwo I can t make calls with wireless in it freezes during almost every call and crashes often 
len ratingone She said she said she said she is from Hawaii how to say cute in japanese 
len ratingone Kawaii
len ratingfour I sure wish the teams app didn t send the message by hitting the enter key instead of a new paragraph it sends the message I learned the hard way to key the shift prior to a new paragraph but really there is a send arrow that is all you need
len ratingfive Using it the first time and I like it 
len ratingone Probably the worst app I have ever used 
len ratingone For starters it doesn t even work 
len ratingone Second when I sign in it assumes I m a criminal or not myself 
len ratingone When I finally manage to sign in I have to wait minutes for the Microsoft servers to load 
len ratingone Microsoft is very unreliable with everything they make 
len ratingone Such a poor user experience especially on mobile 
len ratingone Why would you force users to create an account and go through a poor user experience 
len ratingone I know the reason your greed but your greed should not be at the expense of customer experience
len ratingone It s like following Twitter 
len ratingone I feel my soul leaving me 
len ratingfive I use it for work and it gets the job done 
len ratingthree App works great 
len ratingthree Very similar to Whatsapp but does have a few bugs 
len ratingthree Experiencing upload delay and issue attaching videos 
len ratingthree Would also be nice to be able to name the chat via the mobile device when setting it up can only create group name on PC 
len ratingthree Often we need to create a chat in the field 
len ratingfive  After the latest update there is still an issue where all long posts in our channels in Teams gets cut off only can see the top of it with no option to scroll down when looking at posts through the mobile app 
len ratingfive Update Also unable to delete messages with hyperlinks sent on via the mobile app 
len ratingtwo Very difficult to work without the ability to share images from copy paste 
len ratingtwo This worker a few months ago and suddenly stop 
len ratingtwo Kind of defeats the purpose of having a share point backed service if I need to store a separate copy of every image on my phone 
len ratingone IM DOING MY PASWORD ITS NOT WORKING
len ratingfive This app my life so much asker to navigate conversations and speak to my team 
len ratingfive Love how microsoft has made this app a great experience 
len ratingfive Wish they implement easy option to add a DL directly into contacts Chats tab 
len ratingfive Also a direct contact icon at left sandwich menu would nice 
len ratingone This app refuses to join a meeting until I give it access to my local network 
len ratingone No way 
len ratingone Apple you should remove this spyware 
len ratingfive Teams is a fantastically created app 
len ratingfive It s well thought out and has all the capabilities necessary to keep me productive from my cell phone 
len ratingfive But the Teams app made this a team stronger than ever
len ratingfive I can t message my teachers or my classmates if I have a project
len ratingfive Great training this help clear up somethings I didn t quite navigate correctly 
len ratingfive Excellent for quick communication 
len ratingfive Seamless integration with other office software 
len ratingfive Teams has made my days so much easier 
len ratingfive The collaboration tools and easy set up from everything like sharing files calls and not needing IT to build thing to organize our work 
len ratingfive It s a life saver 
len ratingtwo Every day another Teams update 
len ratingtwo Perhaps they should completely fix the app instead of an update every single day 
len ratingone Will you guys pleeeaaase fix the iPad Pro audio issue 
len ratingone I can t use this app in my iPad because the sound randomly lowers to the point where I can t hear what anyone is saying 
len ratingone So I exit the meeting join again volume is fine for the first seconds then suddenly the volume lowers to a whisper 
len ratingone There are complaints about this all over the web 
len ratingone PLEASE 
len ratingone FIX 
len ratingone IT 
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfive Keeps the team communicating 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfour Needs the promised lite desktop app or option 
len ratingfour Needs strictly vertical chat chat on top or bottom contacts above or below chat window 
len ratingfour App works well but takes up to much space 
len ratingfour Screen share chat call are the valuable features 
len ratingfour All the files and apps within apps and connection to share points is just overhead 
len ratingfour The product works well though 
len ratingthree So yeah we all sort of had to use this during the pandemic 
len ratingthree Both for work and for school 
len ratingthree It s a pretty good app but if you can use zoom for the meetings that would be better 
len ratingthree The meetings can be glitchy 
len ratingthree Sometimes teams automatically kicks people out of the call and also automatically mutes people 
len ratingthree When you have a lot of people on the call sometimes you can t hear anything 
len ratingthree Either no sound comes out or there is a really high pitched sound 
len ratingthree The chats are pretty good though 
len ratingthree Although I must admit I do prefer the iMessage format to the Teams format 
len ratingthree If your looking to use teams for a long term project with a lot of people I would suggest you look elsewhere all though it is quite easy to use and set up group chats 
len ratingthree The judgement of weather or not your going to use it is up to you but know that there might be consequences despite Teams s easy set up 
len ratingthree Three star is an appropriate rating I d say 
len ratingthree Is worthless 
len ratingthree If you have to authenticate every time you use the app it is not mobile 
len ratingone I missed a meeting yesterday because I was sick and there were important notes in the chat I need to access 
len ratingone But there is no way to see prior day s meetings 
len ratingtwo I use teams solely for work and it s forcing me to have a separate profile for friends and family which none of them use teams 
len ratingtwo Every time I try to open a message from the notification shade it has a seizure and rapidly switches back and forth between my work and personal profile until I force close 
len ratingone There is no reason to require access to a local network when I m on cellular and it s a massive breach of privacy on behalf of Microsoft 
len ratingtwo  Enable file name editing with sort options upload multiple photos at once
len ratingthree  Okay
len ratingfour The app is great 
len ratingfour Plenty of qualities that make the app easy to use 
len ratingfour My only gripe with teams is the inability to hide multiple messages at once 
len ratingfour I work with a very large team and company and the individual conversations can build up quickly 
len ratingfour So having the ability to click edit and check a box next to all the messages I want to hide would be very helpful 
len ratingfour It would save me and I m sure many others time and a bunch of extra clicking 
len ratingfour Oh and last thing and it s because I m dealing with it now when trying to save this get rid of the nickname 
len ratingfour Just let someone submit without having to save one 
len ratingfive It took me a little while to learn the nuts and bolts of this app but now it does all the things I need it to do 
len ratingfive It s an excellent tool for our group 
len ratingthree Edit support pages please 
len ratingthree It randomly does and doesn t work on the Same assignment and when it doesn t work it says preparing file and never shows up 
len ratingthree I had to use google docs as my middle man multiple times took me really long to finally get something to work You really need to fix this 
len ratingthree Edit my teacher uploaded things in order and in my iPad it shows out of order and every time I attempt to play the video the mp she posted in files it has no audio and and I click on it and it sends me out Edit I went up a star because you guys are fixing up the app 
len ratingthree Im still having problems with notifications 
len ratingthree I sometimes don t get them I guess it s cuz I have the app open but that s seriously causing me problems 
len ratingthree Ps I ll give better rating if you support my browser This app is not supported online on my browser 
len ratingthree First of all you decided you weren t going to support it 
len ratingthree  Because you guys originally did until one day it just didn t Second of all now I have to download this app waste my space that im running out on 
len ratingthree And yes by the way just in case you I m overreacting I have used teams for two years now and it has had glitches all the time Are these really the same people with word PowerPoint Forza Horizon Who literally own Minecraft 
len ratingthree Doesn t look like it 
len ratingthree I have a lot of work interactions throughout the day on this app and there is no option to remove those messages from my personal phone call history on the iOS app This was a dealbreaker for me so uninstalled 
len ratingthree On the app on iPhone the chat feature is not easy to find 
len ratingthree Once someone sent a chat I realized where it was but this seems an critical important function that should be as easy to find as the emotive icons 
len ratingfive Nuff said
len ratingthree Other than my need for a texting option I d love this app 
len ratingthree Is there a way to access email in the Teams app 
len ratingfive Good quality even when communicating from US to China 
len ratingfive AWESOME 
len ratingfive It s so good I totally recommend it
len ratingtwo I m not sure what the problem is but I have my Teams iphone notifications set to show everywhere and persist 
len ratingtwo I even turned on the darn voice notification from Siri and no matter what I don t get notifications consistently 
len ratingtwo I am so sick of hours later seeing some message that was sent to me that I never even was notified about 
len ratingtwo I ll go do a deep dive to figure it out hopefully but for an app that is a messaging app you would think that they would have the notification system solid 
len ratingfive  Theres an issue I ve been experiencing where all long post in our channels in Teams gets cut off only can see the top of it with no option to scroll down when looking at posts through the mobile app 
len ratingfive Update Also unable to delete messages with hyperlinks sent on via the mobile app 
len ratingone Freeze when your boss call you 
len ratingfive This is great easy to use and understand 
len ratingfive Great for meeting you don t even have to be at the office so never an excuse for missing a meeting lol over all I d recommend to other businesses looking for a Communication app
len ratingone This is the worst application ever 
len ratingone Shame on you Microsoft 
len ratingone No teams option at the bar 
len ratingfour MS teams combines powerful organizational tools with calls calendars and chat functionality 
len ratingfour My favorite cool feature so far is the close captioning embedded in the calls particularly useful when have multi country calls 
len ratingfour Chat box should become detached for all chat activities not for single discussion this would allow for simultaneous chat and document collaboration work 
len ratingfive This app is very very convenient I love it
len ratingfour Works well only downside is you get notifications but the chats aren t there
len ratingone Hi
len ratingfive I love the way we can communicate with co worker from anywhere 
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingone No good
len ratingtwo Every video conference app has the option to minimize the the video and open other apps except this one 
len ratingfive Very very useful app for meetings
len ratingtwo I can see the companies I ve been invited to but when I click on it it just goes to the main account 
len ratingfive I love Teams 
len ratingfive Because of this app I can keep in touch with my team of amazing customer service agents all while working in the comfort of my own home 
len ratingfive  Theres an issue I ve been experiencing where all long post in our channels in Teams gets cut off only can see the top of it with no option to scroll down when looking at post through the mobile app 
len ratingfive Update Also unable to delete messages with hyperlinks sent on the mobile app 
len ratingfive Definitely an outstanding tool for connecting people and resources 
len ratingfive I loved it 
len ratingone I need to be able to join a meeting or call someone from the CarPlay interface without pickup up my phone 
len ratingone When I select the teams app in CarPlay I get siri telling me something is wrong 
len ratingone When I select the webex app in CarPlay I see a list of meetings tap one and I m in 
len ratingone Your CarPlay Implimentation is wrong 
len ratingone Great artists steal 
len ratingone It s a good App but it consumes a lot of data and this is a negative point especially while one is using internet data via mobile 
len ratingone Useless app just like other MS useless things
len ratingfive Hhh
len ratingfive To much to do on this tool 
len ratingfive Share chattering documents videoconferencing etc 
len ratingfive The best tool 
len ratingfive I got this app when I got windows and decided to install it on my phone and it s great 
len ratingfive The interface is very simple and easy to use everything is pretty straightforward 
len ratingfive The only thing that I m not a fan of is that the other person has to have teams installed on their device to message or call back 
len ratingfive I think you should be able to use it like sms and text call without needing the other person to have the app 
len ratingfive It s not a real problem but just a little feature suggestion for future updates 
len ratingtwo  After installing iPadOS the Bluetooth to my AirPods is buggy 
len ratingtwo If i am in a meeting on TEAMS and decide to switch from my AirPods to my internal speaker the AirPods Bluetooth will not reconnect to the meeting 
len ratingtwo I go into settings and they are paired connected i disconnect reconnect and still nothing 
len ratingtwo The only way is to end the meeting and re join so that my AirPods reconnect 
len ratingtwo I have been using my AirPods via TEAMS since the pandemic and they work great until this new update to iPadOS 
len ratingtwo Also the nd issue is when using TEAMS on my iPad in a group chat with my video on the camera shuts off after i bring another app to use while in the chat 
len ratingtwo For example if i am in a meeting with my camera on and i want to reference an email or take notes as soon as i drag any other app to initiate the multi tasking split screen feature the camera shuts off and cannot be turned unless i stop the multi tasking feature 
len ratingtwo Using FaceTime and doing the same thing works great 
len ratingtwo I can be in a group chat and have the notes app running or pretty much any app that has the capability to multi task and FaceTime works and camera stays on 
len ratingtwo This fix will greatly increase the capability of this app on an iPad 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingfour This app would be complete for me if sometimes i didn t have to be on app to get notifications 
len ratingfour It s the only thing from me giving stars 
len ratingfive Love the TEAMS app 
len ratingfive I had many reservations in the beginning however today its my go to app and platform for all activities
len ratingfive I just started using this from my current employer and this app is a great way of communication between employees 
len ratingfive Love that you can call if needed 
len ratingfive  Please fix the notification issue notification does not pop up or sound out and is cause late response to messages 
len ratingfive Please fix this
len ratingfive I don t mean to give this app a review I just wanted to say that it s glitching out and probably a mistake with the system 
len ratingfive On my teams account all of a sudden my chats option disappeared 
len ratingfive It also said that I cannot make or receive calls on teams 
len ratingfive Hopefully this is just a simple mistake that can easily be fixed 
len ratingfive I love using Teams it s so much better than zoom
len ratingone UI hangs during calls becomes unresponsive or unusablely slow to use chat or interact with the UI at all during meetings especially when viewing shared content 
len ratingfive Super easy to navigate and convenient to work on the go 
len ratingfive It s been great to be able to chat with coworkers 
len ratingfive Easily accessible and mobile 
len ratingone First it s laggy 
len ratingone Second it s not letting me join anything even though I m signed in 
len ratingone Third fix the problems because I am studying in these sessions and I can t not use anything but Microsoft teams 
len ratingone Fourth all my school is using it so I can t change to another app and fix these problems please it would make me happy and make me watch my sessions because now I can t 
len ratingone Fix the lagging problems
len ratingtwo It was a pretty good app year ago but now after all the updates it keeps on lagging crashing and when i switch apps it automatically hangs up my meeting 
len ratingtwo It takes to much time to open folders while you are in a meeting and it is practically impossible to type anything 
len ratingtwo Bill Gates is such a good man and Microsoft his company is such a good company but i don t understand how they can make this Trash
len ratingthree Not sure why this has to replace Skype but this basically does the same and mostly well except No ability to set when you flip from available to away 
len ratingthree It s just minutes which is way to short 
len ratingthree Skype allowed you to set it 
len ratingthree Using a virtual desktop you can only share a screen you can t share a window 
len ratingthree Not a problem in Skype 
len ratingthree The iOS app works well with the same drawbacks 
len ratingthree It s nicely integrated into the phone and easy to use for calling work colleagues 
len ratingthree Call quality is good 
len ratingfive It s so well organized and efficient 
len ratingfour Teams has been working great but please add support for using AirPlay devices like HomePods etc for audio output 
len ratingfour That would be a great enhancement for the WFH people in the world with TVs and other devices we could use for meetings 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingfive The experience could not be more seamless nor engaging 
len ratingfive Mark the moment with corporate MS Teams on my BYOD iPhone I finished an all hands company town hall a cross function HR call complete with slides chat and live transcript and a on call 
len ratingfive Very pleased 
len ratingfour Needs to be a way of deleting a thread
len ratingthree Recently we have started using shifts for our working days and PTO management 
len ratingthree We have noticed that there are inconsistencies with how working shifts and PTO presents on the app vs on the desktop 
len ratingthree The desktop is always correct however the app will not show all the people working 
len ratingthree There s also general display inconsistencies between desktop and app 
len ratingthree Also some freezing when going in and out of app 
len ratingthree Hi there we recently started using Shifts to manage our PTO calendar at work 
len ratingthree We ve run into quite a few display issues and would love to see some fixes 
len ratingthree The biggest bug is when viewing a single day the people working often leaves out people that are suppose to be working on that day 
len ratingthree It correctly displays on the desktop but not via the iOS app 
len ratingthree There are also some smaller display issues and inconsistencies with the desktop view 
len ratingthree I also am unable to change shift reminders it only allows for hour reminders despite trying to change to another time frame 
len ratingfive Very nice app
len ratingfive Best app addition to my phone I ve made in years 
len ratingfour It is a really useful tool and becomes very handy to have it on your phone but it has highly memory consumption 
len ratingfour I think it would be useful to have an independent app just for the Teams chat and calls that would help to have an less demandant option that the actual app 
len ratingfour  Es s per til pero tiene el problema de que consume mucha memoria 
len ratingfour Me parece que ser a muy til contar con una app independiente para chats y llamadas as se tendr a una opci n mucho menos demandante que la app actual 
len ratingtwo Ever since I updated yesterday to version on the app doesn t show the user status most of the time 
len ratingtwo I can t be sure messages are being delivered 
len ratingfour I used to have it but it went away when the app updated 
len ratingfour Slack and Zoom are both terrible but useful 
len ratingfour Teams is Microsoft doing a great job of slamming them together in the most utilitarian way ever 
len ratingfour So stars however if the trend of making it hard to switch default apps in W continues this would drop to and an uninstall
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Teams make it so easy to communicate with my employees 
len ratingfive Instead of using different platforms we use this for everything 
len ratingfive You can record meetings create group chats call one another everything 
len ratingfive Freaking awesome We love it 
len ratingfive I like screen sharing my phone for demos and recording features 
len ratingtwo  Respectfully this app sends me error filled notifications with regularity 
len ratingtwo Messages are misattributed old channels populate with messages that shouldn t be there and sometimes all chats disappear 
len ratingtwo It has been this way since I downloaded it a year ago 
len ratingthree WebEx sends multiple notifications that stay visible enough for the recipient to respond 
len ratingthree Teams should do that as well 
len ratingthree I have missed or been late because I am focused on something else and miss the notifications 
len ratingthree Please extend display time and frequency 
len ratingfive It s pretty user friendly 
len ratingfive Allows collaboration 
len ratingfive I love the ability to add notes and attachments
len ratingfour Teams Zoom I like that meetings will automatically just start 
len ratingfour Zoom doesn t have that feature 
len ratingfive Our world revolves around Teams 
len ratingfive We are MORE connected now with Teams 
len ratingfive Some food has come out of the pandemic 
len ratingone Teams is a piece of junk comparing with slack 
len ratingone The sole purpose of making it is to sell it to stupid CEOs who know nothing about technology and don t even use it themselves 
len ratingone The garbage access control only allow safe devices yet provisoned devices are not safe at all it s just selling point to stupid corps 
len ratingone Worst nightmare ever 
len ratingthree Needs more emojis
len ratingone I try to sign in but it crashes then my account keeps repeating the process 
len ratingone Fix this right nos
len ratingfive I only made a good review cuz I use it for school
len ratingfour I think Teams is the future with respect to remote working and internal collaboration and the future is now 
len ratingfour I appreciate how this platform is developing tho I d like less bugginess 
len ratingfive Very easy to operate 
len ratingfive We use it at my work to communicate with other coworkers our store as a whole or other stores in our company 
len ratingfive Makes it extremely easy to make calls video chats or just simple messages back and forth 
len ratingfive Only issue and it s a minor one is that I have to keep signing in every couple weeks which gets super annoying 
len ratingfive Other than that no problems at all 
len ratingfive If there are any bad reviews it s probably because they don t know how to work the app or their phones software is very outdated to which they ll try to blame the app 
len ratingfive No issues here 
len ratingfive  Theres an issue I ve been experiencing this week where all of my long post in our channels in Teams gets cut off only can see the top of it with no option to scroll down when looking at post through the mobile app 
len ratingfive Update Also unable to delete messages with hyperlinks sent on the mobile app 
len ratingfour I m not happy with much it lags it messes with my work 
len ratingone If you have an iPad mini 
len ratingone  sit this one out horrible crackling during calls which is extremely disruptive 
len ratingone  UPDATE Trying new version that just came out hoping that resolves the issue
len ratingfour I work at a Dental School and we recently switched to a Teams phone system which has been nice 
len ratingfour And the convenience of chatting amongst ourselves in Teams Chat is great 
len ratingfour However when you have the app on your phone the business calls ring through on your cell phone 
len ratingfour Can you please add an option to turn cell phone call access off on the Teams app so as not to receive business calls on your personal cell 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingfive Teams blows Skype out of the water 
len ratingfive It s better very clear with no delays or voice with video synchronization problems 
len ratingfive No snow and I ve been in meetings with over people logged in to Teams without a glitch or delays 
len ratingfive It truly is an amazing app for web meetings 
len ratingfive We tried to utilize Skype for our platform with NC DEQ but it never went anywhere people just quit using it 
len ratingfive There was problems just trying to do a small group of maybe to people and Skype could not handle it 
len ratingfive Most times we just defaulted to audio because video was a nightmare 
len ratingfive Going from Skype to Teams was like going from old dialup internet to fiber optics speed and quality no joking 
len ratingfive I really can t see an app for web based meetings working any better plus it s very user friendly 
len ratingfive I know there are other apps out there but these are the two NC State has tried as far as our agency goes 
len ratingfive Thanks Devin Brisson
len ratingfour Use it for work 
len ratingfour It s great allows me to stay connected while away from laptop 
len ratingfour Only thing I don t like is how the notifications don t sync with my laptop i e 
len ratingfour if I view a message on my laptop it ll still show as a notif on my phone 
len ratingfour I feel like it inconsistently does that sometimes the notifs go away sometimes not 
len ratingfour Also annoying when it appears that there s a notif msg and when you open the app there s nothing 
len ratingfour Otherwise it works well 
len ratingthree Overall organization and useful tool 
len ratingthree Too often calls hang up or use connectivity
len ratingone Calls to non teams numbers drop as soon as they are answered 
len ratingtwo Cannot hear anything if logged in through i phone pro max even if it is set to full volume please fix it 
len ratingfive  Theres an issue I ve been experiencing this week where all of my long post in our channels in Teams gets cut off only can see the top of it with no option to scroll down when looking at post through the mobile app 
len ratingfive Really robust has great scheduling features but not very well optimized 
len ratingfive Eats like all my CPU usage on desktop
len ratingfive I feel like teams is one of great inventions from Microsoft life became so easy 
len ratingfive I work from home and still love the ability to use the app instead of going into my office each time 
len ratingfive With my company we use teams all day long between screen sharing and meeting training chats to ask questions 
len ratingfive Without teams my work from home job wouldn t be possible 
len ratingfive And the app just makes it even easier to stay connected 
len ratingfive Amazing plate form 
len ratingfive Way to go Microsoft 
len ratingtwo It s kinda sad cause when I sign in it says I have no internet connection but I do 
len ratingtwo I have online school and have to use a tiny phone screen
len ratingfive As the title says I honestly love this application 
len ratingfive However I do believe that there could be some adjustments augmentation or modifications made that would be more user friendly 
len ratingfive Interfacing with other MS documents and applications can be a bit staticky 
len ratingfive There are other modifications that I have written down elsewhere that I ll send 
len ratingfive But otherwise I really do enjoy the app 
len ratingone Latest update no longer lets you use the app unless you give it permission to scan and collect data on every device running on your local network 
len ratingone Carefully crafted pop up reads To make and receive calls go to Settings and allow Teams to access your network Shame on you for tricking unsuspecting users with your carefully chosen words 
len ratingfive Great product and easy to wield
len ratingthree  We use Teams in our organization however it s very slow on iPhone 
len ratingthree Sometimes it might take several minutes to load recent received messages 
len ratingthree It looks like this I receive notification that someone wrote a message 
len ratingthree I click on it and chat window pops up however I see only old messages 
len ratingthree New ones aren t there 
len ratingthree There is no progress indicator of loading and it s hard to understand what is going on 
len ratingthree It s very frustrating 
len ratingthree After several minutes I receive new messages only 
len ratingthree Similar thing when I try to start a chat 
len ratingthree I tap to message someone and nothing happens 
len ratingthree If I tap many times then many windows will pop up after several min 
len ratingthree These are very annoying bugs 
len ratingthree It looks like a sloppy implementation 
len ratingthree It s hard to believe that these bugs exist for many versions of Teams 
len ratingthree Also it s not an internet issue since it s as fast as Mbit of actual download speed higher on PC and very low latencies as well 
len ratingone I hate school
len ratingfive I really think it s real convenient for people to use this app because it s a good way of networking with people in your team especially when you have a task are you need to contact somebody so I definitely love the app
len ratingfive Superb 
len ratingfive Well designed interface for corporate office home professional needs 
len ratingthree It s fine except since I downloaded it on my phone the one on my laptop will not allow me to join meetings 
len ratingthree I have to join them on my phone 
len ratingone Not only does this app tend to cut out during live meetings and glitch but it does not allow iPad users to split screen with other apps without turning off the camera during live meetings 
len ratingone This is a critical feature within my field as I work with clients who have autism and when doing telehealth my Registered Behavior Technicians need to both be sable to access safari for data collection while simultaneously having their camera active so that I can accurately observe session 
len ratingone This is a feature zoom and other similar apps have I don t understand why Teams is behind 
len ratingone You need to download the app on an iphone because for some reason the website isn t supported on safari
len ratingthree It s a great communication resource but needs the option of being able to see who is online when logged in 
len ratingthree We need to see the list of active people so that we know who is online without searching individuals 
len ratingone Hi so you might be thinking everyone else gave a star review but I gave only stars so here I go plz read the whole review and you will understand so I use this app for my online classes and sometimes it just cuts the call for no reason and I miss something every time it does that it does that a LOT and sometimes the screen just goes black and I can t see the notes and the worst problem in the assignments when I try to upload more then at a time it takes forever to upload and if I do it by one it is time waste and I doesn t let me upload a video more than seconds which is a bummer for my assignments not the best app Edit now it just crashes every time I open the app I am In holidays so now it s okay but my school starts soon WORST APP EVER DO NOT DOWNLOAD Edit first day of school after holidays and it won t let me attach anything HOW am I supposed to finish my assignments ANd it still sometimes crashes I have to shutdown and restart ITS ANNOYING AND NO RESPONSE from the DEVELOPER TEAm STAR and now it says I need permission to join a meeting I go to settings and everything is perfect I allowed every thing BTW I am not a Karen this is something likened to my education that s why I am very concerned about this
len ratingfour Everything is perfect except the fact I can only view a short window of my calendar schedule 
len ratingfive The
len ratingfive I am new to Teams 
len ratingfive Best about this is it is linked to Microsoft accounts 
len ratingone I can t use with homepod mini as a conference speaker
len ratingfive To my surprise Teams is awesome 
len ratingfive A little complicated to administer but with integrated video calling file sharing calendaring and more it s more full featured and better than Slack 
len ratingfive Well built 
len ratingfive Background removal on video calls is previous generation compared to Zoom though 
len ratingfour Some of the smaller parts of Teams are very half baked 
len ratingfour I can make a task list but it has no real details other than the name of the task the assignee and the due date 
len ratingfour It s also terribly hard to view from a phone 
len ratingfour It s so limited that it really makes more sense to manually enter tasks in another system which is a real shame considering it s right there I m guessing this has to do with the underlying ties to SharePoint in which I always felt lists were notoriously quirky 
len ratingtwo I m looking everywhere in the app for the calendar but it s nowhere to be found 
len ratingtwo It s not on the bottom of the screen anymore 
len ratingfour Ys
len ratingone The worst program ever
len ratingthree  This app keeps showing a badge that I have one unread chat but I have read all of my messages 
len ratingthree The Win desktop version and web app version show everything as read 
len ratingthree I tried signing out and back in clearing the app data in Setup and uninstalling reinstalling the app 
len ratingthree Doing these things makes the badge go away for a few minutes but then it comes back 
len ratingthree This started after I updated the app version a week or two ago 
len ratingthree Please fix this is very annoying 
len ratingone Teachers who use teams are red flags 
len ratingthree When I go to send a message to the person and it says there are people on the thread I can t determine who they are 
len ratingthree Sometimes if I hover over the name on the rhs list it displays the names but most of the time it doesn t 
len ratingone When people trying to join usually do not appear in the lobby also always i suffer problems with mic or video 
len ratingone People voices breaking or the teams kick me out and I can t rejoin 
len ratingfive I love this app it s awesome and makes communication simple 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive Teams is great but the notifications are driving me up the wall because people keep posting in my conversations instead of starting a new conversation 
len ratingfive Lol
len ratingfive Very helpful when communicating with my virtual employees
len ratingtwo The Teams app has had a lot of defects recently which are effecting our Teams communication 
len ratingtwo Great app and works well on the iPhone but not usable on iPad 
len ratingtwo Bug When on a call the audio will stop working speaker AirPods any other speakers despite nothing indicating that there is an issue 
len ratingtwo Bug When the Teams app is side by side with another app the Teams app won t share the camera when on a call 
len ratingtwo Bug Switching back to the app while on a call or in a chat also always brings up the keyboard in side by side mode 
len ratingtwo This is annoying when on a call after switching back I always have to dismiss the keyboard that comes up 
len ratingfive I work at different doctors offices locations and use this to give and receive messages from my coworkers if they need questions or if I need to ask a question 
len ratingfive It s like IM messenger 
len ratingfive It s great to have in a workplace 
len ratingfive This app is the best 
len ratingfive I hope it replaces Outlook soon 
len ratingone Teams is performing horribly on my devices freezing and the CDC all s a red topping and I m using this for work and it s very aggravating my devices are also up to date
len ratingtwo  I successfully joined a video meeting but I cannot start one and I cannot delete old unneeded chats 
len ratingtwo Was a app until these issues occurred 
len ratingtwo These issues appear to be new with iPad OS 
len ratingone But does not remove the notification when viewed on other devices 
len ratingone I dont have this issue on android why on Apple 
len ratingfive The premier app in its class 
len ratingfive The concept of Activity Centered Collaboration was envisioned by Lotus IBM and implemented at scale by Microsoft 
len ratingfive Great Collaborative effort 
len ratingfive Professional application for daily communication with friends and family and colleagues 
len ratingfive Fast messaging app 
len ratingone  Hi so you might be thinking everyone else gave a star review but I gave only stars so here I go plz read the whole review and you will understand so I use this app for my online classes and sometimes it just cuts the call for no reason and I miss something every time it does that it does that a LOT and sometimes the screen just goes black and I can t see the notes and the worst problem in the assignments when I try to upload more then at a time it takes forever to upload and if I do it by one it is time waste and I doesn t let me upload a video more than seconds which is a bummer for my assignments not the best app Edit now it just crashes every time I open the app I am In holidays so now it s okay but my school starts soon WORST APP EVER DO NOT DOWNLOAD
len ratingthree UPDATED STILL SHOCKED that these updates have not yet come to the app 
len ratingthree Reducing rating for now 
len ratingthree Microsoft has created a truly outstanding tool that has proved itself invaluable with regards to remote working from an iPad iPhone 
len ratingthree A few items that need to be addressed URGENT 
len ratingthree  To match the functionality of Zoom on iPad OS the camera should remain on when in slide over split screen mode 
len ratingthree This is ESSENTIAL 
len ratingthree  On iPad allow users to open chat participant list in a sidebar while still viewing the participants in the call 
len ratingthree The fact that the entirety of the screen is taken up by chat and participant list is a major frustration when monitoring groups and or chat 
len ratingthree  In call support keyboard shortcuts for muting unmuting opening chat participant list at a minimum 
len ratingthree  Ability to manage breakout rooms via iPad OS 
len ratingthree  The ability to edit meeting notes Wiki from the iOS app 
len ratingthree Thanks for all the fantastic work on the app 
len ratingone Don t download if you value one single shred of privacy 
len ratingone Downloaded to non cellular iPad not allowed to utilize app until I verified a personal cell number 
len ratingone I m sick of being tracked for add revenue by giant multinationals 
len ratingone This app does not work after multiple updates and reinstalling 
len ratingone It is a great texting chat app but useless for joining conference calls from a mobile device for meetings without separate dial in numbers 
len ratingone For web A V only calls Microsoft requires you to grant access to your home network to join a call which a huge invasion of privacy 
len ratingone Presumably they want to track users by doing network scans 
len ratingone I recommend folks use Zoom or GMeet or another competitor that works without exposing your local network 
len ratingthree  Edit my teacher uploaded things in order and in my iPad it shows out of order and every time I attempt to play the video the mp she posted in files it has no audio and and I click on it and it sends me out Edit I went up a star because you guys are fixing up the app 
len ratingthree Im still having problems with notifications 
len ratingthree I sometimes don t get them I guess it s cuz I have the app open but that s seriously causing me problems 
len ratingthree Ps I ll give better rating if you support my browser This app is not supported online on my browser 
len ratingthree First of all you decided you weren t going to support it 
len ratingthree  Because you guys originally did until one day it just didn t Second of all now I have to download this app waste my space that im running out on 
len ratingthree And yes by the way just in case you I m overreacting I have used teams for two years now and it has had glitches all the time Are these really the same people with word PowerPoint Forza Horizon Who literally own Minecraft 
len ratingthree Doesn t look like it 
len ratingfive Really like this app 
len ratingfive Clean design organized easy to understand and navigate 
len ratingfive Easy to use and communicate with my team on a daily basis 
len ratingone Doesn t work on computer for no reason 
len ratingone One time it works another it doesn t making it impossible to work with it 
len ratingone It s not compatible with most systems and there s constantly some error popping up 
len ratingone It s ridiculous
len ratingfive This is the most versatile and adaptable and productivity creating value not just in the office but out on the floor working on the front line 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingthree I like the app 
len ratingthree I just wish it were smart enough to know when I was accessing Teams from my desktop so I wouldn t receive multiple notifications about a chat or call 
len ratingfive  This is an awesome app
len ratingtwo Sometimes i cannot see my teacher open the room and when i log out i cannot sign in again in the web browser it cannot load and i didn t take my class that day
len ratingfive Greatest way to stay connected while working remotely 
len ratingone had a important college interview every time I tried to sign in it would say sign in error try again later
len ratingtwo  Push Notification banners and sound sometimes don t work 
len ratingfive That s the standard now a days
len ratingone  The fact that this feature wasn t included in the very first iteration of teams blows my mind 
len ratingone I can t imagine why anyone would design a calendar without the most basic features that come standard in any decent calendar software 
len ratingone Who allows courts to use the app for trying to prosecute someone 
len ratingtwo I use multiple conference call apps and this is the only one where the volume is always too low even at max volume settings 
len ratingtwo Seems this is a common issue 
len ratingone  It s the worst 
len ratingone I have to choose from being so distracted by completely arbitrary nonsense because I can t mute the conversation or not know anything that s going on because I left the conversation entirely 
len ratingone Truth be told Microsoft doesn t really design anything obviously 
len ratingone Team requires access to my local network in order to let me get on a meeting 
len ratingone I don t see how discovering my local network has anything to do with this 
len ratingone If I don t allow it teams refuses me access to meetings and is thus unusable in iOS 
len ratingfive Great and super helpful tool for a different groups in a large organizations 
len ratingtwo The app is riddled with problems syncing with the desktop and integration with the entire office 
len ratingtwo I m not sure why it keeps notifying me of a message but it s already been cleared 
len ratingthree App is great across the board except cellular connectivity hence reducing stars 
len ratingthree On stable G connections it regularly has issues videos turned off to help and still shotty whereas a call on WhatsApp or even HD FaceTime still works perfect 
len ratingthree Tells me it s Teams 
len ratingfive Teams has features that beat Zoom webex and Google Hangouts for global multi cultural multi time zone teams Transcriptions access to and organization of recordings and shared files integration with Outlook and easily adding removing team members 
len ratingone This app gave me depression please take it down 
len ratingtwo Cannot join meeting from current conversation 
len ratingtwo Android app can do this
len ratingone it s very racist
len ratingone Why i cant share invite link in mobile app 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Works well 
len ratingfive Syncs well with other ms products 
len ratingthree I belong to multiple Microsoft work organizations but unlike Slack Teams only lets me add one org so I have to access the others through a web browser 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s a solid app but for some reason it still seems less smooth than Slack and the multi orgs limit is a real blocker to using it more 
len ratingfour I tried to change my profile pic but it says error and same when I send messages please fix this 
len ratingfive This app is incredibly useful for if you need to connect into a virtual meeting if you re not near a computer and the features are great 
len ratingone You are forced to use this app instead of a web browser on iPadOS even on a GB ram M iPad Pro 
len ratingone I d much rather use safari 
len ratingone But Microsoft wants the extraordinary amount of personal information an iOS app gives them vs a web browser 
len ratingone And multitasking is not enabled using their app 
len ratingone I m only using teams because I have no choice 
len ratingfive Team is so amazing for I call people so good 
len ratingone Now refuses to allow joining without the connect to local network permission which it absolutely does not need to function 
len ratingfour Do you 
len ratingthree When on meetings it always tell me bad network 
len ratingthree And to dial in 
len ratingthree Then I can hear the team fine but my voice goes in and out 
len ratingthree So I have to call in
len ratingthree Delivers on everything except stability and resource utilization recognizing there is a lot for the development team to manage to deliver on the promise of this kind of app which I now couldn t live without the app is an outsized consumer of system memory resources that lead to stability issues 
len ratingthree Overall very useful 
len ratingthree Really tired of being unable to delete old logins off the iPhone app and it freezing when trying to switch between them 
len ratingthree These have been known issues for YEARS 
len ratingthree Fix them please 
len ratingtwo This app was awesome and it worked great for class ahahaha of the time 
len ratingtwo Usually it would randomly kick you out or wouldn t let you turn in your camera 
len ratingtwo Honestly I think it s one of the worst apps ever made 
len ratingtwo It doesn t even LOAD on the computer 
len ratingtwo It s always uNrESpOnSiVe 
len ratingtwo So like of the time it didn t work 
len ratingtwo It does work okay on an iPad or phone but you should be able to use it on any device 
len ratingtwo This app is just no 
len ratingtwo You can t click on a notification because the app goes into an infinite loop and you have to kill it 
len ratingtwo Some Microsoft genius thought it was a good idea to add personal accounts to the platform 
len ratingtwo Notifications from corporate teams makes the app to switch to it and it goes into the infinite loop 
len ratingone The app will no longer send audio over Bluetooth 
len ratingone I m unable to use Teams on my iPhone and iPad with my headphones or Bluetooth speaker 
len ratingfive I really love this app 
len ratingfive Never have I used an app to communicate with my work team remote until now 
len ratingfive However it s missing one very important feature 
len ratingfive the ability to DELETE messages 
len ratingfive It s an eyesore still seeing messages from months ago 
len ratingfive I travel a lot for work and I love to have open communication with my staff 
len ratingfive This allows me to have one platform with my Team and keep it separate from the email and text where it can get lost 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingone Since updating iPadOD it Just sits connecting and never connects 
len ratingone I don t know why but sometimes when I turn my camera or my microphone on I was out of the meeting 
len ratingone So please producer please fix this 
len ratingone It s the worst error I ve met 
len ratingone I can t study or even answer a question 
len ratingfive Dear support team Thank you for your effort to simplify our life day by day 
len ratingfive  Please improve the search facility that I can be able to search for groups while sharing any picture or video from other application within the mobile to MS Teams 
len ratingfive  add forward option to forward within MS Teams from individual user to a group or group to individual Regards
len ratingfive Teams has played a vital part in elevating our talent connecting with each other in real time and makes communication seamless 
len ratingfive If you are a leader looking for a platform to connect your team this is by far the best 
len ratingfour I wish it was more like Skype and ran in the background had better profiles pop up windows and profiles but it s better than emailing conversations 
len ratingone Notifications consistently become out of sync across desktop mobile and browser based acesss points 
len ratingone On iOS requires an app data reset to clear notifications and to align with what s read vs unread on the desktop 
len ratingone This is only an issue in the MS Teams mobile app 
len ratingone I have not experienced this with MS Outlook 
len ratingtwo The app asked for local network access and per support forums on the internet will stop working without this 
len ratingtwo Totally unnecessary and an annoying ask with potential security and privacy implications 
len ratingone The app is ok I guess but it s hard to separate the mobile app from the system itself 
len ratingone Msft is trying to be Lotus Notes 
len ratingone They ve ruined the way companies actually collaborate in the name of looking new for the young crowd 
len ratingone Teams is just another collection of data repositories resulting in a sprawl that turns into a mess 
len ratingone Bad app bad system 
len ratingone If you have an influence in solution development do not do teams 
len ratingone You will regret it
len ratingone Why is this a five star app 
len ratingone It doesn t even work 
len ratingfive Works fine
len ratingfour This is a good app but there s times where it lags out and crashes 
len ratingfour I also hate when it says loading or switching chats and then it just lags out and crashes 
len ratingone Too glitchy 
len ratingone And my school can read my private messages 
len ratingone Do not recommend 
len ratingthree I wish you all had an option in chat to take screenshots lol and annotate on them 
len ratingthree So many times I ve needed this feature during product discussions but the only option is to upload files 
len ratingthree Zoom has this feature in their chat functionality 
len ratingfive I like teams my work messages pop up on my phone just like text messages 
len ratingfive And I like the call and virtual features too 
len ratingfive I like the way it keeps me connected 
len ratingone It s filled with bugs
len ratingfour Love everything I can do with teams but the direct messaging interface chat is primitive a lesser substitute for Skype and the integration with exchange calendars meetings creates far too many message threads 
len ratingfour When that is addressed I ll gladly give stars 
len ratingfive Helps me feel connected 
len ratingfive A great way to learn from one another and build a support system 
len ratingfive I really love Microsoft teams because there is where I get assigned all my homework mostly all I can get passwords that I need for important stuff 
len ratingfive And if I forget my ID I can go on Microsoft teams to look at it or my student email 
len ratingfive Overall I LOVED THE APP
len ratingfive With iPhone Pro Max when logging into work account 
len ratingfive After approving via Authenticator app teams crashes 
len ratingfive After reopening app username is there but will not log in at all 
len ratingfive I work in a position where I get to train people from out of my state 
len ratingfive This is HUGE HUGE tool I use every time 
len ratingfive I love being able to screen share and see what they re seeing or what I am seeing on the screen 
len ratingfive It beneficial on fast messaging calls and support chat groups 
len ratingfive I wouldn t be able to do good portion of my job without this app 
len ratingfive This app has made our team more productive during the pandemic 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive I love how well it integrates with Outlook 
len ratingfour I love teams the audio and video quality are superb but I wish there was a way to erase conversations and mute notifications as needed 
len ratingfour If there s a way please let us know 
len ratingfive I am so thankful for Teams 
len ratingfive I work remotely and Teams allows me to communicate instantly with my co workers with instant answers to questions 
len ratingfive Teams has made my life easier 
len ratingfive Teams is a great resource for collaboration at work 
len ratingfive Excellent communication application
len ratingone Limited functionality and poorly organized 
len ratingone There are basic things like seeing file folders that you can t do in the Teams iPhone app thus you can t access stored documents while away from a computer 
len ratingone There are simple tasks like sharing links that you can t do effectively because if the file name changes the path breaks 
len ratingone Had to switch from Google to Teams for work and Google is a much better product 
len ratingfive Teams is a very user friendlyPlatform for office communication 
len ratingfive Simple to access instantaneous and silent 
len ratingone Missed my court date trying to connect forever WIFY works 
len ratingfive TEAM T Together E Everyone A Achieves M More
len ratingone I don t want to go to class anymore
len ratingfour We adopted Teams at the beginning of Covid and its been a lifesaver for telework 
len ratingfour I would just love some additional features for the Teams Planner it s so useful but development needs to be happening faster 
len ratingfour Would love to be able to mention individuals on shared tasks 
len ratingfour It would be GREAT to be able to include a photo in the Board view for each task 
len ratingfour There seems to be a glitch when trying to edit documents in Teams using an iPad 
len ratingfour Currently I must download the document to my iPad edit it in another app then re upload it to Teams 
len ratingfour These are just a few examples of features that should be added to make Planner more functional 
len ratingone My colleagues on the Windows team at my company tell me that but I was excited to switch 
len ratingone It s nice to leave my desk and still have access from my phone but Teams is a PITA and here s why 
len ratingone Half the time it doesn t find my AirPods 
len ratingone If it does find my AirPods and I use them during a meeting my phone can no longer find them after the meeting ends until I restart my phone 
len ratingone I ll close every app I have open wait a few minutes for background processes to close try again and still nothing 
len ratingone If my status is set to Out of Office I still get notifications 
len ratingone If I m on vacation I have to go into the OS settings and turn off notifications for it 
len ratingone It makes no sense considering how integrated it is with every other app in Office 
len ratingone That s really it 
len ratingone Fix and and I ll bump the score up to a iPhone Pro Max 
len ratingthree Normally I don t leave reviews but this app has a major flaw whenever I am in my work meeting the screen goes black intermittently and won t allow me to do anything yet I can hear my coworkers talking 
len ratingthree It will switch in and out from a black screen making it difficult to do anything else on my phone 
len ratingthree Other than that a good app 
len ratingthree I use Teams daily for work 
len ratingthree While the app is good in terms of phone calls and messenger it has one major bug that drives me insane 
len ratingthree It gets stuck as having an unread message or notification when I really don t have any pending messages or notifications 
len ratingthree This drives me CRAZY I search the entire app and not to mention it s very alarming to think I may have missed a team member s message 
len ratingthree The only way to get rid of it when this happens is to delete the app and re download load 
len ratingthree I know it s a bug because it ll show a notification on my phone app but on the desktop nothing is pending 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingfour Work is work how likes it 
len ratingfour But this teams app for iPad is pretty good 
len ratingfive I was introduced to Teams for working remotely and it s a great communication tool 
len ratingfive Especially for business 
len ratingfive Like more integrated with iOS
len ratingfive Please add Outlook email to Teams 
len ratingfive Why not have the ability to send emails 
len ratingfive Also it would be nice to open up files inside of Teams without having to close the files to perform other things 
len ratingfive Why can t the file s be launched in a separate window process independent of Teams so we can still Chat and join other meetings without having to close file s 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree Need some work to make some of its functionality more intuitive 
len ratingone Stuck on white got it screen 
len ratingone When it works there is no audio and the volume does not do anything 
len ratingone The UI is tiny 
len ratingthree After upgrading to IOS the call control no longer shows up on locked screen 
len ratingone  Teams on the iPhone is Ok but it s a bloated app that continues to get bigger because there is no way to clean the caches it creates 
len ratingone The overall usability is sightly worse than any other app in this space most notably slack 
len ratingone But because you are likely using it because you have office for work or school you ll use it any way because you don t really have a choice 
len ratingone If you did nearly any other choice you could make would be an improvement 
len ratingone  Hi Thank you for sharing your feedback one of our resolutions for is to trim down our size while providing even more useful functionality 
len ratingone If you can provide more specific information on how we can improve on we will defin
len ratingfive Easy to navigate
len ratingthree Wish I could delete old messages and do so easily without swiping 
len ratingthree Not a fan of hiding and having to swipe for that too 
len ratingone As stated in the title
len ratingtwo Lots of lost space use of space in conversations can be improved having to check tabs or more to chats and groups make it difficult to use
len ratingtwo I have accounts 
len ratingtwo One of them has a name i dont want with an old email 
len ratingtwo I CAN NOT change the name or the email regardless of what i try 
len ratingtwo Either errors out or theres no option 
len ratingtwo I also cant remove my old number from that account to put on my new one 
len ratingtwo I can not stress how frustrating this is 
len ratingfour Easy to use 
len ratingfour its not bad
len ratingfive Great tool clear and secure 
len ratingfive better than Zoom 
len ratingone Students must give this a star so it will be taken down and no more STUDYING Also the mic is very glitchy
len ratingfive I download it since 
len ratingone Deletes work unreliable takes forever to load and is an overall awful app
len ratingone CarPlay not working in latest update 
len ratingone Tried removing the app restarting the app and the car 
len ratingone No luck 
len ratingone It s really annoying and laggy
len ratingthree  I work on a construction site where I take several site photos daily and use Teams to store them share them with my team back in the office 
len ratingthree I have the app on my phone and take pics on my phone 
len ratingthree I want to upload multiple photos at the same time 
len ratingthree It s really annoying that I have to do one at a time when I ve got anywhere from to several dozens of photos that need to go up 
len ratingthree PLEASE fix this ASAP 
len ratingfour Since the last days I have been facing some issues in seeing images in private chat and channels 
len ratingfour As a student who usually use Teams on phone I also have some issues on Microsoft Forms when doing assignments some questions are unreadable if it s a bit long and when sending more than images it lags for a second even when my phone has GB of RAM 
len ratingfour The overall app U I and performance is very satisfactory except for one thing 
len ratingfour The automated spelling should not try to mess with capitalized names and proper nouns 
len ratingfour Many people have nontraditional spellings 
len ratingfour My colleague s non English name was mutilated in the opening line of an email I sent to him with no human input 
len ratingfour Please make it easier to opt out of automated text suggestions and forced spelling changes 
len ratingfour It is intrusive and does not add value for experienced writers 
len ratingfour Teams is fine 
len ratingfour The only issue I have is not being able to set the Away Inactive timer 
len ratingfour It seems to be set as a default minutes without any keyboard activity 
len ratingfour This should be a user timing preference 
len ratingfour Even AOL Messenger had it 
len ratingfour And the ability to disable Apple Watch notifications 
len ratingfour Please 
len ratingfive WE have created a lot of efficiencies just from implementing the TEAMS app 
len ratingfive So easy to communicate 
len ratingfive Everything is well done 
len ratingfive I can make groups 
len ratingfive I can contact someone on computer or phone so no matter what if they re in a meeting or in a shop environment 
len ratingtwo  After installing iPadOS the Bluetooth to my AirPods is buggy 
len ratingtwo If i am in a meeting on TEAMS and decide to switch from my AirPods to my internal speaker the AirPods Bluetooth will not reconnect to the meeting 
len ratingtwo I go into settings and they are paired connected i disconnect reconnect and still nothing 
len ratingtwo The only way is to end the meeting and re join so that my AirPods reconnect 
len ratingtwo I have been using my AirPods via TEAMS since the pandemic and they work great until this new update to iPadOS 
len ratingtwo Also the nd issue is when using TEAMS on my iPad in a group chat with my video on the camera shuts off after i bring another app to use while in the chat 
len ratingtwo For example if i am in a meeting with my camera on and i want to reference an email or take notes as soon as i drag any other app to initiate the multi tasking split screen feature the camera shuts off and cannot be turned unless i stop the multi tasking feature 
len ratingtwo Using FaceTime and doing the same thing works great 
len ratingtwo I can be in a group chat and have the notes app running or pretty much any app that has the capability to multi task and FaceTime works and camera stays on 
len ratingtwo This fix will greatly increase the capability of this app on an iPad 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingfive This app is a great way to communicate with teammates and ask questions when working down the hall from one another or if you are working from home 
len ratingfive The screen sharing mode makes it easy to present as well 
len ratingthree Let me delete messages
len ratingone Ya no puedes hacer login fuera de la app 
len ratingone Solo para ganar mas descargas PATETICO 
len ratingfive Best app I have used for video meetings with the iPhone 
len ratingfour Please add the old features like removing people from chats and deleting and editing messages most importantly and stuff Pllllzzzz
len ratingone If I have this app on my iPad why do I have to go through financial procedures to download it from the clout to my iPhone 
len ratingfour Finding where you store files within teams is hard 
len ratingfour Needs better emojis and reply in line
len ratingtwo  After installing iPadOS the Bluetooth to my AirPods is buggy 
len ratingtwo If i am in a meeting on TEAMS and decide to switch from my AirPods to my internal speaker the AirPods Bluetooth will not reconnect to the meeting 
len ratingtwo I go into settings and they are paired connected i disconnect reconnect and still nothing 
len ratingtwo The only way is to end the meeting and re join so that my AirPods reconnect

len ratingtwo This fix will greatly increase the capability of this app on an iPad 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingfive Sometimes I miss important messages because I don t get notified
len ratingfour Love the app the only thing I would change is to have the alerts stay on when my phone is locked 
len ratingfour Right now if someone messages me in Teams and my phone is locked a notification pops up briefly but then disappears 
len ratingfour It would be nice if the alerts or notifications stayed on your phone so that you can tap your locked phone screen and see who has called or messaged you on Teams the same way you can see texts or calls direct to your phone 
len ratingone always crashes and very laggy pls fix this 
len ratingfive  good business
len ratingfive This app is a behemoth trying to do many things at once but the best part are the chat message suggestions 
len ratingfive It s so good like as a kid I love it
len ratingfive Excellent for communicating anytime 
len ratingone I can t download the aap on my iPhone why 
len ratingfive I use Teams on an iPad great for messaging and calls the mobile frees up screen space on my desktop 
len ratingthree Everything is great about this product except for two things Major exposing actions in meetings by default is hugely annoying 
len ratingthree I constantly have to worry about whether I accidentally hit the video or mic and it happens frequently for teammates who do so inadvertently so I know it s not just me 
len ratingthree Eg use cases I transfer my call to mobile in a large group call to quietly take a bathroom break 
len ratingthree Or I want to go on a walk 
len ratingthree Either would be extremely distracting to have your video feed start accidentally 
len ratingthree Please hide actions on tap 
len ratingthree Consider swapping placement with the back stack bar at the top 
len ratingthree  minor I keep accidentally reacting to chat messages 
len ratingthree I m not sure if the double click is new and I m triggering but it seems to happen on hold sometimes 
len ratingthree Either way something changed and I keep having to remove my emojis 
len ratingthree Other desired update would be to make status more flexible would like to use out of office 
len ratingthree Thanks for making a great app otherwise 
len ratingfour It is complicated to learn 
len ratingfour I couldn t really find good instructional videos 
len ratingfour The information is overwhelming 
len ratingfour A friend was able to show me in person 
len ratingfour I like it but I am still learning 
len ratingone I need to use this for school and can t view assignments When I click view assignment
len ratingfive I use Teams everyday 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfour I wish there was that option
len ratingone When Someone Put A Video There Is No Sound
len ratingone I can t even log in it just keeps loading
len ratingfive Sometimes the app works sometimes it doesn t 
len ratingfive Love the s App 
len ratingfive Love being able to communicate with team members all the time 
len ratingone  Why 
len ratingfour Every time this app updates it screws up the Shifts app within Teams 
len ratingfour I am on three schedules and the one I manage is always kicked out and I have to email Microsoft for help getting back 
len ratingfour This has happened five or six times now 
len ratingfour Very frustrating when I get a schedule question and I can t access it on the app 
len ratingfour I love Teams app when compared to Slack 
len ratingfour But only negative thing is it is consuming too much of memory in my laptop which causes hanging or crashing issues
len ratingfive Team is a great way to connect with coworkers and friends 
len ratingfive It is really beneficial to know when coworkers are available for meetings and questions 
len ratingfive It s definitely handy when needing to store and share documents 
len ratingfive GOOD FOR school
len ratingfive L
len ratingone So bad 
len ratingone Almost like trash when compare to zoom
len ratingthree  We used Skype prior to this 
len ratingthree I thought finding staff and immediately seeing if they were available or not was much easier on Skype 
len ratingthree Teams you have to dig around more 
len ratingthree In a group the people are bunched so you can t see current status 
len ratingthree It s hard to find people 
len ratingthree Still needs a lot of tweaking 
len ratingfive makes life so much easier
len ratingfive Teams is a great tool to communicate directly to your teammates 
len ratingfive Helps build a strong collaboration 
len ratingone It was easy to turn on my Out of Office status but now difficult to turn off 
len ratingone TERRIBLE APP
len ratingone MS teams will take over and be the default for your FaceTime calls 
len ratingone It s super annoying and inconvenient 
len ratingone I literally had to delete the app on my phone 
len ratingone Even does this on my laptop 
len ratingone Literally nothing can be done 
len ratingone So weird
len ratingfive Using Teams for remote meetings and chat messaging 
len ratingfive Smooth clear video and sound 
len ratingfive Improves team communication 
len ratingfive This is a Great Way to promote Better Company Communication 
len ratingfive I absolutely Love it and the Value that it brings to our office 
len ratingfive I ve used several apps looking for an easy way to communicate with several people across a wide geographical area with varying success 
len ratingfive However Teams has met all of my needs and then some 
len ratingfive It streamlines the ability to pass down guidance and updates to keep my officers across the state informed in real time without having to make individual calls 
len ratingone The teams makes my whole computer laggy and is also laggy itself it is the most worst app ever 
len ratingone The latest version requires ability to connect to devices on your local network to join meetings 
len ratingone Joining meetings shouldn t require connecting to the local devices on your network and indeed this capability worked fine up until around v 
len ratingfive One of the best apps on the App Store 
len ratingfive Great product by a terrible company 
len ratingthree Lags a bit and the app restarts in a really short time period when minimized
len ratingfive Nice tool
len ratingone Lagging and flashing like crazy on IP 
len ratingone Haven t anyone noticed 
len ratingone Have to restart everytime i check for mess from notification cuz it s like a disco ball no joke
len ratingone I opted not to share my contacts and Microsoft took them anyway 
len ratingfour I like everything about teams except one missing functionality the ability for the presenter or participants to point out highlight and circle on one slide 
len ratingfour It is important in creative meetings when artwork is being reviewed 
len ratingfive I am constantly on the move never in one spot or one computer 
len ratingfive This app helps me keep in communication with my direct reports and peers throughout a dynamic work environment 
len ratingfive A few things I request in a group chat I would like something to highlight when somebody is directly addressing me 
len ratingfive Would also like to see my calendar linked too 
len ratingthree Teams has a lot of potential but the menu is not very intuitive 
len ratingtwo When you are in the meeting it is quite hard to go through your computer it makes your device lag also there appears to be a serious microphone problem with me and other people but it is dealable so yeah
len ratingfive Love love love 
len ratingthree great that it moves between platforms like computer and iPad 
len ratingthree Still a little clunky and needs more PDF versatility
len ratingone This permission has no relevance to a person working from home 
len ratingtwo Plz fix this 
len ratingtwo So I can do my schoolwork 
len ratingone Oh no 
len ratingone Something went wrong 
len ratingthree Love the convenience of the app especially for meetings 
len ratingthree But definitely need to re evaluate the calendar capabilities 
len ratingthree Can only view six days in advance and it s crippling if you can t pull out a laptop and look at anything further 
len ratingthree I was watching a seminar on the iPhone app and the slides were always one slide ahead of the slide that the presenter was actually on 
len ratingthree It was like I was in the future 
len ratingthree Everything worked fine when I switched to My windows laptop 
len ratingthree Fix the iPhone glitch and I ll give it stars 
len ratingone Giving it star cuz I m forced to use this for school
len ratingtwo Why when I change my profile picture it changes by it self to letters 
len ratingtwo Like for real why I hate it 
len ratingfive I m really enjoying the way Teams has improved our real time communication cut down on email and allowed us to meet without the waste of travel time or having to find a suitable conference room 
len ratingfour Cannot screen share 
len ratingfour  when the iPad mini is connected to a projector can you help me 
len ratingfour We need this because some students are with us in class and some ate home using teams 
len ratingone Plain and simple let me delete old things from my iPhone Teams so that it s not taking up more and more space I don t need to keep ancient chats 
len ratingone Other than that it s fine but THAT is a dealbreaker 
len ratingfive Muy excelente
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingfive It s great
len ratingfive Make my work life so easy to communicate with my team mate 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfour I can t figure out how to adjust the volume control when I m in a meeting 
len ratingthree My calendar always seems to show no events 
len ratingthree Even after refreshing multiple times 
len ratingthree Kind of tough to join meetings when I can t even see them via the app
len ratingfive Thanks Microsoft 
len ratingfive Teams is really cool and user friendly 
len ratingtwo So muted conversation is not a thing 
len ratingtwo I have several muted conversations but yet still get every notifications known to man 
len ratingtwo It is wicked frustrating what s point of mute if it does not mute eh 
len ratingthree I had to give it a because when i was in class my cam was spazzing out and kept turning on and turning off resulting to lag please fix this 
len ratingtwo  The app is riddled with problems syncing with the desktop and integration with the entire office 
len ratingone I do not need teams to scan Bluetooth or the local network to find other devices and this app will not make phone calls or teams audio unless I enable these 
len ratingone Why can t the app just use internet connection and airplay and Bluetooth headphones and work 
len ratingone I don t understand the need to scan all devices capture traffic from my iPhone to have the app make audio calls 
len ratingone It even wants to scan the network on LTE 
len ratingone Odd requirement that breaks functionality for no reason I can tell 
len ratingone Why is the app requiring access to scan my local network if I want to join a Teams call 
len ratingone There s no reason for that and it s disregarding users privacy 
len ratingfour I only use this app for online lessons And obviously I hate it but its pretty good Nothing to complain about ugh but I have to say that I hate fact that teachers can call you THEY WAKE ME UP EVERY FREAKING MORNING I m tired dude
len ratingfive App i is so good I love it
len ratingthree The app keeps crashing everytime i try to enter it i dont know if its because of me logging my microsoft account onto my pc or it s a bug but either way i need this issue to be fixed ASAP because i have online learning and i can t log into this app properly
len ratingone Ugly I didn t like it to glitchy and you couldn t even get in half of your meetings
len ratingfive Teams works great for text voice and video communication 
len ratingfive The layout of the interface makes it easy to use 
len ratingfive The app mirrors the windows program very well 
len ratingone  IT MAKES ME DO HOMEWORKKK 
len ratingfour It would be really great if it was possible to go forward and back in the right window particularly for the Files tab 
len ratingthree I have to share lots of photos with my team and having a do so one at a time is friggin tedious man 
len ratingthree If I could mass select and upload like in google drive that d be dope 
len ratingone This app from a multibillion dollar company refuses to join calls without being able to scan my network 
len ratingone This is NOT NEEDED and a privacy concern 
len ratingone You run just fine on LTE so you don t need to scan my network nor know my location with that much precision 
len ratingone Apple should pull this until you fix that 
len ratingfive This is a great platform for communication and connecting with your team 
len ratingtwo This app like old model make it new bring some updates on it Make it smooth
len ratingfive Over the last year or so having real good experiences with App that is universally being utilized 
len ratingone The app freezes immediately after launching it 
len ratingone Tried to contact support and that also doesn t work 
len ratingone Filled out the form but there is no button to submit it 
len ratingone Just a get help button that shows you useless articles 
len ratingone this app used to work but now it is completely useless 
len ratingfive Perfect app to make my job easier 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive POEM ROSES ARE RED VILOETS ARE BLUE I LIKE JOANNA AND BLUES CLUES
len ratingfive The TEAMS app is excellent 
len ratingfive It is very well thought out even the minute details 
len ratingfive This results in the ultimate user experience 
len ratingone It s never happened to me with iPhone but with this app my phones shut down after a few seconds using it
len ratingfour Best way to send pics to my Team so they get the them in a timely manner 
len ratingfive The best app for getting the gang back together 
len ratingfive Video chat instant messaging groups sessions all in place 
len ratingone Won t let me log in and constantly crashes probably won t get to do a job interview tomorrow because of this thanks 
len ratingfour I have worked both on slack and teams 
len ratingfour There s more power and potential to be unlocked here 
len ratingfour The name says it all 
len ratingfour A place for teams to collaborate and work 
len ratingfour Many great features for organizing teams doings 
len ratingone Have this on my work iPhone 
len ratingone It always stops sending calls and messages through unless I open and refresh the app so IT has to keep reinstalling it at which point it works for a week or so 
len ratingone The status of people in recent chats are not updated 
len ratingone You have to click on each chat to see if they re really online 
len ratingone I was surprised today to see everyone available on a non work day 
len ratingone Went to message one of them and the app went from saying available to not seen in days 
len ratingone GMail has been doing this with only html for like years 
len ratingone Come on MS 
len ratingone It asks if I like teams and if not to submit feedback 
len ratingone The link just takes me to some generic MS website where there is no clear way to submit feedback 
len ratingone I still strongly prefer WebEx for meetings 
len ratingone In Teams If you join a meeting on your laptop without a microphone and then join on your phone to be able to speak it literally doesn t let you shut off the speakers on your laptop 
len ratingone The volume control in Windows has zero effect 
len ratingone Everyone will despise you for that horrible high frequency interference you will generate and be unable to stop due to the laptop speakers being picked up by your phone 
len ratingone No way to shutoff laptop speakers 
len ratingone I ve been using Teams for a long time and somehow my microphone isn t working only in my iPad th gen Works fine in all my devices iPhone iPhone MacBook Pro Thinkpad W laptop but somehow it is buggy in my iPad 
len ratingone I keep cleaning cache and reinstalling Teams app for iPad sometimes works for a couple of days and then another embarrassing moment during meetings 
len ratingone I use it for school thats why I hate it get rid of it
len ratingone This app is not worth downloading
len ratingone  U should remove app
len ratingone As much I was happy with the app and started converting all office phones to teams I now regret it and we are consistent reverting back 
len ratingone Luckily our VOIP is still in place 
len ratingone Since the app update users are not able to make any teams call or join a meeting unless they enable Local Network for the Teams app 
len ratingone This is so creepy that Microsoft wants to have access to the local network 
len ratingone Our associates refuse to enable that and I do not blame them 
len ratingone Fix that people 
len ratingthree Wish I could see all participants on video while I am sharing document 
len ratingfour I like Teams but wish there was a mobile call in option for the Teams meetings 
len ratingfour Easier to be mobile with a phone
len ratingone All of the good reviews here must have never used Slack because MS teams is in my opinion pretty awful compared to that 
len ratingone Is MS Teams better than Lotus Notes 
len ratingone Sure 
len ratingone But it is I expect a better collaboration tool than a basic bloated app that just upsells into other MS products 
len ratingone What a shame my employer is going to MS Teams from Slack because Teams is cheaper 
len ratingone Looks like I will be just emailing more because MS Teams isn t much better that that 
len ratingone Cheaper product cheaper results 
len ratingone Very disappointed with this MS app 
len ratingfive So this tool stratus to tie file conversation and meeting all of not one place 
len ratingfive It is a great tool 
len ratingfive Now here is the push for Microsoft teams engineers 
len ratingfive I need more 
len ratingfive Their is not a tool on the market that gives me enough of what I need 
len ratingfive Here are some examples 
len ratingfive Looking for things I have done like files and conversations that hook to meetings 
len ratingfive A way to trace My Day back to a meeting by clicking on the meeting 
len ratingfive You can get there with the tools but it is still not easy enough to do so and I end of flipping through a number of screens to find what I need if I can find it at all 
len ratingfive Here is another one 
len ratingfive In a big company their are a lot of people 
len ratingfive A way to fav a employee in a meeting and write a few notes about him would be powerful 
len ratingfive Maybe tag his name based on key words in meeting title 
len ratingfive The tool is great and I expect it to get better I just ask that you survey power execs to see how you can help them as well 
len ratingfive We expect everything at our finger tips with little effort 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work you are going on the right direction 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone App crashes constantly 
len ratingone Install reinstall no change 
len ratingone I don t know why companies would choose this 
len ratingone Audio quality was poor compared to zoom or webex 
len ratingone Integration with outlook barely works 
len ratingone Half the time I can t open a teams meeting from outlook on my mobile device without Teams telling me the meeting is not supported on mobile devices 
len ratingone Avoid using if you need serious communication tools 
len ratingthree Some challenges with locating Teams Files chat glitches but overall good option to keep business moving on the fly 
len ratingthree Teams is good except for the fact that you have to pay extra for dial in numbers and the fact that you can t share video recordings with people outside your organization which we use a lot for training purposes 
len ratingfive I really recommend everyone trying this app out it is AMAZING
len ratingfive Helps the team interact and helps in improving the productivity
len ratingfour Teams is great 
len ratingfour Better than zoom in many ways but ultimately it suffers because of its roots as an enterprise software product 
len ratingfour Little things that should be easy are overly complicated like changing setting the default account to start up in 
len ratingfour Or the fact that it s cumbersome to send someone a link to join a meeting without them being part of your organization already 
len ratingfour Teams wants their email and wants to enroll them in the organization 
len ratingfour There are work arounds but easier to just switch to a zoom meeting and send out links 
len ratingfour THERE IS SOMETHING terrible I really want u to fix it so badly so I wanted to change my profile picture but it keep changes I changed it like pics but it s still so please fix this problem please I appreciate it 
len ratingone I m on a brand new iPad and when in conference calls people can t hear me 
len ratingone Works at first and the mic stops working 
len ratingfive Honestly great 
len ratingfive Only wish the calendar view was more like the desktop version showing breaks between meetings 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingtwo I rate because messages conversations automatically delete after so long 
len ratingtwo If you done go into setting to turn on notifications Chat the other person won t know that they have a message 
len ratingtwo I guess I m so used to regular texting 
len ratingtwo Lol 
len ratingfive MeetingAnd conversations are easier using app 
len ratingone  Teams has been a buggy mess and not that intuitive for most of our groups 
len ratingone Many use Zoom instead although our company wants us to use Teams 
len ratingone Have to say that the iOS version of Teams is better than the Mac OS version though 
len ratingone Some people have university and business accounts for Teams and trying to switch on a Mac is a nightmare easier for iOS version 
len ratingone Like many Microsoft apps and products Teams just has that beta feel to it lacks an intuitive interface design and has been unstable 
len ratingone With MS poor product support Teams is just not a viable solution 
len ratingone I hate school
len ratingthree I like Teams overall but I don t like that my chats are deleted so often 
len ratingthree Sometimes I need to refer back to information or deadlines obtained in a chat and it s always gone when I really need it 
len ratingthree For that reason I stick to email 
len ratingfive As a grandparent supporting my daughter to raise her kiddos I can stay in touch and productive while on the go 
len ratingthree  Edit I went up a star because you guys are fixing up the app 
len ratingthree Im still having problems with notifications 
len ratingthree I sometimes don t get them I guess it s cuz I have the app open but that s seriously causing me problems 
len ratingthree Ps I ll give better rating if you support my browser This app is not supported online on my browser 
len ratingthree First of all you decided you weren t going to support it 
len ratingthree  Because you guys originally did until one day it just didn t Second of all now I have to download this app waste my space that im running out on 
len ratingthree And yes by the way just in case you I m overreacting I have used teams for two years now and it has had glitches all the time Are these really the same people with word PowerPoint Forza Horizon Who literally own Minecraft 
len ratingthree Doesn t look like it 
len ratingone When some one is sharing screen we don t need to see people all the time 
len ratingone At least not so big 
len ratingone Extra default buttons are not needed unless we want them on the screen 
len ratingthree Need to get help with design but it s a good foundation 
len ratingfive Ggggh
len ratingone Word 
len ratingfive I m liking a lot of the new stuff in teams breakout rooms and positive reactions and so forth 
len ratingfive In our fully remote age Our team would really benefit from some sad and mad reactions to 
len ratingfive To be able to empathize with our colleagues who might have for example a lot of fire drills in their apartment complex that s worth a isn t it 
len ratingfive How about mad amp sad reactions then 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingtwo Its the reason i avoid teams 
len ratingtwo The meetings are always loud and cannot be turned down 
len ratingthree Teams is great when you know how to use it 
len ratingthree It s very difficult for people who don t have teams because the link just doesn t open up righ to teams 
len ratingthree Many of the time I can hear people because they can get there microphone to work 
len ratingthree Its frustrating 
len ratingthree Teams needs to make this more user friendly who are not good with technology 
len ratingtwo App is very buggy and crashes too often 
len ratingtwo Also notifications are not always received 
len ratingfive Why not have the same features in the desktop app as the mobile 
len ratingfive I switch to mobile just to respond to a specific messages 
len ratingone Teams started asking for local area network permissions all of a sudden after not needing them for a year that s super sketch and if I didn t have to use this for work I would uninstall it
len ratingfive While Bill was busy making a vaccine to turn everyone into Zombies his loyal employees at Microsoft were busy making the best meeting and chat software to grace this blue planet we call Earth 
len ratingfive Zoom 
len ratingfive No thanks 
len ratingfive Slack 
len ratingfive Never heard of em 
len ratingfive Microsoft is making great software that empowers everyone here 
len ratingfour  Es s per til pero tiene el problema de que consume mucha memoria 
len ratingfour Me gustar a que hubiera una app independiente para chats y llamadas mucho menos demandante que la app actual
len ratingone This app is trash 
len ratingone A complete disgrace 
len ratingone I cannot edit files or add comments without everything crashing down 
len ratingone Shame on you Microsoft 
len ratingfour My favorite thing is how teams calendar is synchronized with my outlook calendar 
len ratingfour I only wish that I could see gallery view during a teams call while I m screen sharing and that I could open two teams tabs at once 
len ratingfour Otherwise excellent 
len ratingfive Print cannot print nor save
len ratingfive Love using it
len ratingfive Teams is so awesome I love it 
len ratingthree Why can t the list open file include the one I have open that I m trying to share 
len ratingthree That presentation is never listed so I have to select screen share on a dual monitor set up 
len ratingthree What is frustrating is I used to be able to share the file I had open 
len ratingthree So stop changing what works 
len ratingthree Confused user Peace out
len ratingone  I hope you all die
len ratingone  i don t like
len ratingone Try to avoid using teams 
len ratingone The notification system is terrible and often leads to a lot of missed messages 
len ratingone The way that messages reorganise when people add a reply makes the conversation history confusing 
len ratingone Limited number of conversations you can pin is annoying because if you have a big team you must use the terrible search functionality to find them 
len ratingone Search muddles up all your content mostly a problem of the mac app 
len ratingone If you are considering using teams for your company go with Slack or basically anything else 
len ratingone Microsoft devs this isn t directed at you at all as you can only do what your product owner allows you to 
len ratingone Why is access to my local network required to join a meeting 
len ratingone I will be uninstalling this app since I do not want to sacrifice my security 
len ratingfive This app is a great part of multitasking 
len ratingfive You can be on a call and respond coworkers and keep workflow moving 
len ratingfive It s really great 
len ratingone This app won t let you join a meeting started with a link from someone else 
len ratingone Keeps making you sign in and reload the app 
len ratingone When colleagues ask me to join a meeting I just call in on my phone 
len ratingone Zoom is way better and easier to use 
len ratingthree Update microsoft teams app interferes with inbound calls and notifications of the same 
len ratingthree Missed crucial calls as a result 
len ratingthree Fuming 
len ratingthree Old news Messes with wi fi functionality 
len ratingthree If you take a meeting on the way in or out of a building audio gets very jaggy 
len ratingthree On the way back in the app literally bars your phone from getting back on the wifi 
len ratingthree Apple needs to make sure no developers app can strong arm their stack like that 
len ratingthree Need lots of education
len ratingtwo It s a nice app when it works 
len ratingtwo It was obviously developed for another platform and adapted to Apple 
len ratingtwo More often than not when I get a Teams notification the screen begins flashing and the message switching alternates flashing with a blank screen 
len ratingtwo It continues until I actually quit the app and relaunch it 
len ratingtwo Then it works until the next time a new notification chat comes thru 
len ratingtwo Yes I ve tried deleting and reinstalling without improvement 
len ratingtwo Missing direct reply to individual message on desktop message but it s available on mobile app 
len ratingtwo Wish this would be available 
len ratingtwo Not sure why Microsoft wont allow this 
len ratingthree I use for our Behavioral zoom chat meeting and whenever open my computer always see anything updated information 
len ratingfour My friend she needs to download this app for school but she can t log in her account 
len ratingfour She is typing in all the right information but still she can t log in 
len ratingone the iphone app is almost for attendance of meetings with link invitation 
len ratingone it gives no access to the chats and other features of the mac desktop app 
len ratingone it is a pity one has to rely on this incomplete app for many larger companies contacting when other platforms are more complete less restrictive and more intuitive user friendo to find what is required 
len ratingone My employer just switched from SLACK to MS Teams 
len ratingone WHAT A DOWNGRADE 
len ratingone Teams and individual messages are on separate tabs which mean I am constantly having to switch views 
len ratingone There is no way to sort messages in chronological order within a team 
len ratingone Messages are constantly getting lost in the chaos 
len ratingone There are only standard emojis to respond to messages 
len ratingone Files and images shared are automatically stored in SP folders unnecessary 
len ratingone AWFUL 
len ratingfive So great
len ratingfive Useful app
len ratingone This would be very useful for screen sharing on a computer when I m not in a private place 
len ratingthree Entering a unique password isn t convenient
len ratingfive Great tool for communication with family and business community
len ratingtwo  This app is not supported online on my browser 
len ratingtwo First of all you decided you weren t going to support it 
len ratingtwo Second of all now I have to download this app waste my space that im running out on 
len ratingtwo And yes by the way just in case you I m overreacting I have used teams for two years now and it has had glitches all the time Are these really the same people with word PowerPoint Forza Horizon Who literally own Minecraft 
len ratingtwo Doesn t look like it 
len ratingone I can t join a meeting I sign in cilck the link and it says it needs access to my mic so I allow it and than it repeats it again 
len ratingone Why would insights only go back months 
len ratingone As a reacher this is incredibly frustrating 
len ratingone Why wouldn t we want this for a year 
len ratingone Please update the data to a longer timeframe 
len ratingone Ideally a year 
len ratingone I use teams for work I m usually not at my office but stay connected through teams on my phone 
len ratingone But I m not going to download another app just to register my device just to use this one seems excessive 
len ratingone I ll pass 
len ratingfive Great networking tool
len ratingone This app never works 
len ratingone I delete the app and reinstall it but it consistently gets stuck on the nd page 
len ratingone It is so annoying 
len ratingone Especially because this is the main communication and collaboration method used by my company 
len ratingtwo  This app is great but there is a huge issue limitation that makes this not as useful 
len ratingtwo When using the app on my iPad in a group chat with my video on the camera shuts off after i bring another app to use while in the chat 
len ratingtwo For example if i am in a meeting with my camera on and i want to reference an email or take notes as soon as i drag any other app to initiate the multi tasking split screen feature the camera shuts off and cannot be turned unless i stop the multi tasking feature 
len ratingtwo Using FaceTime and doing the same thing works great 
len ratingtwo I can be in a group chat and have the notes app running or pretty much any app that has the capability to multi task and FaceTime works and camera stays on 
len ratingtwo This fix will greatly increase the capability of this app on an iPad 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingone This app shouldnt be as bad as it is there are plenty of better services that allow for meeting up for bussiness with better calls and chats and the fact everything is more annoying than it should be to do really shows the quality of this app
len ratingfour On the mobile app I am able to reply to a message in a group chat 
len ratingfour But on desktop I am not able to 
len ratingfive Works great and no issues at all 
len ratingfive Great tool that keeps you even more connected 
len ratingfive Love being able to meet on the fly to become even more effective at my job 
len ratingtwo  I do not need teams to scan Bluetooth or the local network to find other devices and this app will not make phone calls or teams audio unless I enable these 
len ratingtwo Why can t the app just use internet connection and airplay and Bluetooth headphones and work 
len ratingtwo You don t need to scan all devices capture traffic from my iPhone to work 
len ratingfive Good one
len ratingfive Powerful and user friendly Comm App 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfour We use the Teams app on our cell phones Android or iOS and desk top PCs 
len ratingfour Use it for video conferencing and can join from mobile app or desktop 
len ratingfour Use it to text and share desktops for collaboration 
len ratingfour US based auto seat manufacturer in South Carolina 
len ratingfour Definitely recommend Teams 
len ratingone The latest update created a very annoying bug on Teams chat for iPad 
len ratingone Out of sudden the chat left side bar disappears and you are left with only new chat list without the possibility to switch among existing chats 
len ratingone  i m going to kms soon 
len ratingthree  the app provides slightly below average functionality and performance for communication and collaboration in modern times it s slow to update you can force restart the app and it still takes seconds to update messages it just buzzed notifies about it s better than nothing tho and is often okay if you have a good alternative link Google s offerings I d recommend that instead I m fairly certain calls are peer to perr or whatever it is performs ok once connected
len ratingfive Great application for collaboration
len ratingfive I do miss the fact that you can reply to an specific comments as you can do in Slack 
len ratingfive But it is a good app 
len ratingfour The chat makes it easier to communicate with our entire team 
len ratingfour Everyone has the ability to provide input 
len ratingfive A nice to have would be to able to preview CAD type vector files as well 
len ratingfive I m really enjoying the functionality of Microsoft teams in the ability to stay in touch with team members and other employees 
len ratingfive Awesome extension of O 
len ratingfour Great app 
len ratingfour But buggy when typing in chat or trying to join calls
len ratingthree Missing the reply option in chat 
len ratingthree  i e not signing in on the iphone 
len ratingthree have to wonder and explore until finally finding it might be possible to be done or not less developed than the desktop which also makes you guessing gruesome
len ratingone  The teams makes my whole computer laggy and is also laggy itself it is the most worst app ever 
len ratingtwo The app itself is very convenient and straight forward however I receive notifications 
len ratingtwo Not for mentions new messages posts in my groups or anything 
len ratingtwo I ve tinkered with the notification settings in the app itself and my phone s own notification settings and still get nothing 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating as this app is used for my job and it s important for me to stay up to date 
len ratingtwo I basically have to check it every minutes to make sure I don t miss anything 
len ratingfive Works great can join calls from anywhere I have data
len ratingfive Teams is awesome there isn t much you can t do with it 
len ratingfive It functions as an instant messenger video conferencing and as a phone amongst many other features 
len ratingfour I m slowly getting acquainted with its use model and its capabilities amp limitations 
len ratingfour Seems pretty flexible and powerful would love a library of supported use cases to help me get up the learning curve 
len ratingtwo  This update requires me to grant local network access 
len ratingtwo That entitlement is not required for the app to work please fix and update the app 
len ratingone take this off the app store 
len ratingone it s terrible not just because of school because of the design as well
len ratingfive She s really good
len ratingone This app is abusing Local Network permission 
len ratingone It refuses to connect to Internet meeting when Local Network permission is not granted 
len ratingone  There is ZERO reason that you need to scan my network for me to make calls 
len ratingone My work laptop is on a different network 
len ratingone Don t understand why star reviews for this app when the forums are flooded with internet connection error all over 
len ratingone Always internet connection not there and Microsoft cannot resolve 
len ratingone Tons of folks having this issue very unique error not seen any such error on any iOS app 
len ratingone No steps at all to resolve other than delete and reinstall 
len ratingone Glad I have deleted this app 
len ratingone When joining a meeting the app requests access to your local network devices 
len ratingone If you say no then it does not allow you to join said meeting 
len ratingone This is unacceptable 
len ratingone The app has no need for this access the only explanation that makes sense is Microsoft wants higher fidelity customer tracking data 
len ratingone Microsoft remove this feature or else soon you will scare away all your security conscious users 
len ratingthree Since today I can t connect to a meeting without allowing access to my local network 
len ratingthree This seems like a needless demand and very shady to say the least 
len ratingfive Teams has helped our organization grow with technology seamlessly 
len ratingfive It s an outstanding calibration meeting and sharing tool 
len ratingfive We are now exploring the Teams phone systems 
len ratingfive I was never a huge MS fan but you sure swayed me with the new Microsoft Teams etc Keep going Microsoft 
len ratingone The new requirement to allow Microsoft to scan all devices on your local network is a major breach of Security 
len ratingone Anyone heard of Stuxnet 
len ratingone App is not functional without it 
len ratingone Seriously needs to be remediated 
len ratingone Another example of Microsoft s glaring security hubris that s left the world vulnerable 
len ratingfive I get notices earlier on the mobile app and it is often more responsive as well 
len ratingone T vl v gi tui kh ng th y ppt n a
len ratingtwo The latest version introduces a bug on iOS where notification badge is out of sync 
len ratingtwo Messages alerts etc that have already been read or responded to via the desktop app continue to show on the badge until you open them again in Teams on the phone
len ratingthree This version now requires Local Network permission from iOS or calls will be dropped immediately upon connection 
len ratingthree This a bug that Microsoft should fix 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingone  There is ZERO reason that you need to scan my network for me to make calls 
len ratingone My work laptop is on a different network 
len ratingone Thanks to lockdown I ve been using the Teams app to attend work meetings and make calls which worked just fine 
len ratingone Today after months of no problems the Teams app suddenly claims it needs permission to scan my local network in order to make calls and attend meetings 
len ratingone This has never been necessary before 
len ratingone Microsoft you do not own my device 
len ratingone You have never before needed access to my local network in order for me to make and receive calls and you certainly don t need that access now 
len ratingfive Dang Microsoft has really come a long way 
len ratingfive Teams is probably the most reliable enterprise communication service I ve used to date
len ratingone Need to acess all my network devices to connect to a meeting Privacy nightmare
len ratingfour If you re on a call and want to respond to a different chat you can t go back to the chat function unless someone writes to you 
len ratingfour Similarly the phone is glitchy and there are sound issues quite frequently 
len ratingfour Perhaps most importantly the documents that are uploaded and shared in a chat aren t easily retrievable 
len ratingfour They disappear from the chat the file tab is pretty useless because it never shows the uploaded documents 
len ratingfour Very problematic it is not a safe repository 
len ratingfour Otherwise pretty good but can and I m sure will be improved 
len ratingfive It s fast and have nice UI UX
len ratingfour Audio video chat and doc viewing on iPad are great 
len ratingfour Confidential doc access to share on iPad is difficult so I have to share from the PC 
len ratingfour Fortunately Teams on those two platforms work well together 
len ratingone If you re going to make a theme for pride why can t you make a theme for Christians 
len ratingone I WANT A GOD OR JESUS THEME AND PRAYER RESPONSES 
len ratingthree Time for a face lift and new user interface other than that the app is solid and stable 
len ratingfive Teams is a great tool for collaboration 
len ratingfive Great integration with the rest of the Office suite and from the blogs it seems like Microsoft will continue the integration and expansion of Teams into the Microsoft environment 
len ratingone Would love to be able to join the meetings that exist on my desktop version 
len ratingone Thanks and please fix
len ratingone Why not having easily a quick numbers like zoom 
len ratingone Would be easier to access from other personal devices
len ratingfour This app needs to have recording options 
len ratingfour It will be useful for internal training s 
len ratingone This version does not open on iPhone 
len ratingone Crashes when opens 
len ratingone Has caused me to miss a lot of teams meetings remotely 
len ratingone Can you help fix this so the app does not crash when opening 
len ratingone Rebooting iPhone does not help 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingtwo I used teams daily for work the features are great and the app works well 
len ratingtwo Switching over to personal use for the family edition and it s missing everything that makes it great no team set ups 
len ratingtwo You get Projects with limited teams like fashion 
len ratingtwo However it s really buggy 
len ratingtwo Trying to create a simple tasks in the project and when you add a checklist to it with more than three items the app crashes 
len ratingtwo There is no shared files for these Projects either 
len ratingtwo All the organization I would use for family things seem to be missing 
len ratingfive Changed my life
len ratingfive Got to have it 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree App hao pin qu 
len ratingthree This app double sends notifications often and crashes periodically but it s very capable in most every case
len ratingone You get one star for effort because sometimes the app doesn t just quit a few seconds after I open it 
len ratingone Have t had one of those in awhile but keep trying guys
len ratingone I don t understand why it has this rating 
len ratingone Maybe most teams users are just stupid
len ratingthree Still need to be able to delete all chat conversations
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingtwo Teams is fine but it s a bummer that when I turn celular data off I still get messages coming through when I m outside 
len ratingfive Keeps you connected
len ratingthree Takes too much memory
len ratingfive The teams app is beneficial 
len ratingone This app doesn t work the way it should 
len ratingone I turn notifications off because I don t want work calls coming through when I m not working 
len ratingone And yet even without notifications off the calls still come through 
len ratingone If you log off and log back in you have to redo your settings every time 
len ratingone And it can t keep up with the computer app 
len ratingone So even though I resolve notifications there 
len ratingone The app still shows notifications 
len ratingone And that doesn t even comment on the cluster that is the phones 
len ratingone Don t use this program 
len ratingone It s not worth the hassle 
len ratingfive This app is fantastic 
len ratingfive And works flawlessly
len ratingone It would be great to have replay button on windows app
len ratingfour Hello there I am student that is currently using Teams for my internship meetings 
len ratingfour This app is wonderfully awesome and very useful 
len ratingfour You can connect with other people very easily and the audio is absolutely perfect 
len ratingfour There is something I would like to talk about though When I share my screen with other people in the meeting my camera automatically turns off and people can only see the two initials of my name 
len ratingfour Can you please find a way in which when the presenter shares their screen their camera is still on and other people can still see their face 
len ratingfour Other than that everything is totally amazing and I totally recommend this app to everyone 
len ratingfour This wonderful app quickly connects the community together especially during this difficult time 
len ratingfour Thank you so much for creating Microsoft Teams and providing new updates 
len ratingfour Sincerely Vy
len ratingfour Great app works as intended 
len ratingfour I would like to be able to set my status to Out of Office from this mobile app and not only from the desktop application as I primarily use teams on my phone when not in the office 
len ratingfive I love this application it allows me to communicate with my colleagues to see what is happening this is a gem in these COVID times
len ratingfour Please add the read receipts feature for the posts made within a team 
len ratingfour It is a vital part of communicating to our team to be able to see that every member saw an important announcement 
len ratingfour Love the app 
len ratingfour The only thing that drives my ocd nuts is that I don t have anything unread in chats but it gives me a notification on the icon that I can t get rid of
len ratingfour Pretty annoying issue where I miss notifications for when a person starts a meeting initial join 
len ratingfour Doesn t happen all the time but it happens 
len ratingfour Otherwise a solid app 
len ratingfour After a msg is sent To be able to edit or delete a message will be good feature
len ratingfive Regardless where I might be like Today August 
len ratingfive I am at the last day of our MWEA AWWA Conference at Margartaville in Osage Beach 
len ratingfive I participated of our Operations Morning meeting at KC Water in Kansas City MO 
len ratingfive This pandemic proved we are essential and gave a new perspective to our service oriented careers 
len ratingfive Regardless of formal education economical or social status 
len ratingfive We are an elite group how very proudly guarantee your right to flush 
len ratingfive So help us God 
len ratingthree The app concept is great but needs improvement When it comes to the actual video chat portion of this often you can only have one mic Unmuted before there s a lot of feedback When using the app on your phone you have the ability to talk text but when using the app on your laptop you do not have this ability Also you can hide chats but you can t delete them and that can be frustrating because you end up with so many different chats that you can t get rid of What I really like is that you can do almost anything on it from sharing with large groups to talking individually It s great for large teams and you can mute certain chats that you have to be in but you don t necessarily need to respond to daily 
len ratingfour Rock solid works all the time 
len ratingfour Desktop still to bulky and Zoom still way more consistent and better performing 
len ratingfour If I only used my Mobile I would choose Teams 
len ratingfive Teams has been such an upgraded experience from Flowdock Skype for Business 
len ratingfive Smooth integration from desktop to phone and back transferring meetings is one best feature I love as I am human so is everyone who could read this and may need bio breaks in between meetings Love the breakroom feature 
len ratingfour To be honest this app isn t great because when I try to join a meeting it kicks me out immediately and if somebody calls me into I press join and it kicks me out it allows students to mute and kick out whoever is in the meeting my younger sister uses this and it always says somebody in the meeting removed you and I wish it said who 
len ratingfour This app is not great but I have to write this for school which isn t great either 
len ratingfour Also when I write a message to my friends or teacher it autocorrects to something completely different like if I say hi did you get the answers for question I m stuck on that then it would say hey I want the answers for 
len ratingfour I don t understand this app 
len ratingfour Also it drains you battery like if I have to use my phone for school if my laptop is dead then I use my phone but if I have it at then like minutes later it s at and it s annoying 
len ratingfour That s all I really have to say about this app I wish I could give stars
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingfive Love the Teams app 
len ratingfive It s super easy to communicate with remote teams and the mobile app helps me make sure I never miss a beat 
len ratingfour The desktop teams app should have the feature to respond specifically for a message
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Teams is very user friendly and it connects your entire company together 
len ratingfive It automatically links to your email and calendar for meetings events and also sends you reminders to stay on top of your busy schedule 
len ratingfive Conference calls video and audio are extremely easy to set up and use from your computer or cell phone 
len ratingfive In my opinion Teams is the program that allows businesses to stay connected and operate so smoothly while working remote and out of office 
len ratingfive Great addition to the work place 
len ratingfive ndividual while in a team meeting is not available
len ratingfive Right now I use teams to connect to our people 
len ratingfive I especially appreciate everyone who is onboard for building lifetime relationships 
len ratingfive I think this begins welcoming employees aboard 
len ratingfive What a great opportunity to extend our appreciation for commitments and goals at SunRoc and Clyde Companies 
len ratingfive Best is good enough 
len ratingfour Teams may have its occasional hiccups and idiosyncrasies but it s much more reliable than Zoom
len ratingfive Teams allows me to be connected to the office without having to stay at my desk 
len ratingfive I can respond to team members and join meetings while I m on the move 
len ratingfive Uhm this app is trash ZOOM IS BETTER LOLLL HAHAHAHHAHAHA nah I m joking this app is really good for these times thanks
len ratingone I only downloaded this app for my school and it can disrespectfully kiss my ass 
len ratingone This application is so bad and so many guild
len ratingfive Like the platform 
len ratingfive Phone calls drop off once on a while 
len ratingfive Overall very satisfied with the functionality 
len ratingone  Its not an option like it is on linux or mac i dont want to answer after every time i take a call 
len ratingone I have to open the app to clear the badge notification didnt have this issue on android
len ratingfive Teams is awesome I would recommend giving this app it makes communication so much easier 
len ratingfive This app for my work place 
len ratingfive Is the best to communicate with my team 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Bad design choices make this app a struggle to work with at surprising and unforeseen points 
len ratingone For example it doesn t warn users in any way that if they log into a meeting as a guest they will have access to all of the functions of the service EXCEPT chat 
len ratingone There s no reason for this decision 
len ratingone This is a massive oversight and another example of how Microsoft developers often screw up or over complicate what should be simple 
len ratingone Just use Zoom 
len ratingone All the basic features cannot be depended on 
len ratingone I can t depend on getting notifications 
len ratingone I can t depend on the video service 
len ratingone I can t depend on the audio 
len ratingone I can t depend on the file sharing 
len ratingone Anyone who has used competent versions of these types of services knows how awful teams is 
len ratingone The devs should be embarrassed 
len ratingfive I like teams teams is a good app teams is awesome go teams
len ratingfive The mobile app is seamless to use 
len ratingfive When I m on work calls from my phone is easy to follow along with screen shares and navigate my files 
len ratingfive Very impressed by the design 
len ratingfive This is a great app that lets you communicate with others by messages Voice calls and video 
len ratingfive Really easy to use
len ratingfive I love Teams but should offer the ability to zoom in on spreadsheets when conducting meetings as well as independent if I wanted font larger 
len ratingfive Fantastic app with a ton of features 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work guys 
len ratingtwo  When I launch app all my team members statuses are blank 
len ratingtwo Only when I click on the person below will the status light up fir the team member above 
len ratingtwo I have to do this for everyone on the list 
len ratingtwo So annoying 
len ratingtwo  I miss being able to set my status for a set time as was allowed in Skype for Business 
len ratingfour I am a former MSFT blue and collaboration with this tool is a bit better than the old SharePoint experience with chat etc 
len ratingfour However Teams continues to need work regarding live events and use of PowerPoint and other apps programs with links built in to automatically update with changes 
len ratingfour This is real use cases and something google docs does stellar 
len ratingfour Please work on this because our team is considering the move back to google docs specifically for this as we present to businesses and investors outside of our org 
len ratingfive It s great I get to keep up with my team
len ratingfive Cool interactive and fun 
len ratingone  Lol
len ratingfive Love how I can respond on the go from my phone and not miss anything 
len ratingfour Teams is good Zoom is better 
len ratingfour There are more settings and camera options with Zoom and the clarity of video is clearer 
len ratingfour Only two criticisms is the fact when you delete channels you can t name a new channel the same name 
len ratingfour When you delete a channel it should delete all data associated with it 
len ratingfour Only being allowed to change the privacy setting on a channel during the creation of the channel is inefficient especially when considering my first grievance 
len ratingfour If you mistakenly forget to change the privacy setting upon creation you are forced to delete the channel but prior to doing so you ll need to rename it so you can use the same name when creating the new channel with appropriate privacy setting 
len ratingfour Suggestion Make it to where a channel is deleted all data associated with the channel is deleted so you can reuse the name 
len ratingfour Suggestion Add the capability to change the privacy setting during any point of the channels lifespan 
len ratingtwo I am on a iPhone Pro Max and sometimes the meetings will just not load I have encounter several errors regarding the app as well as the pc version 
len ratingtwo There s one that tells you to hang on while we get things set up for you and they never get things set up lol 
len ratingtwo I had a really bad day and this app just make it even worse 
len ratingtwo There s also error where you cannot see the white board 
len ratingtwo When I checked the internet connection it s just fine but the white board won t just load even when I quit and rejoin the meeting 
len ratingtwo Pls fix 
len ratingone causing mental illness i hate this app delete it rn this is not a statement this is a command speakingfromtheheart
len ratingfive Great app for looking for old friends and I m finally in th grade
len ratingfive One of the best apps on iOS
len ratingfive Great for meetings messenger and presentations 
len ratingfive During the pandemic I ve had to use zoom for meetings when conducting meetings 
len ratingfive Teams is much more straightforward and easier to navigate 
len ratingfive Peer programming is great creating an event in teams and use that to name the video chat that is used
len ratingthree  Biggest complaint is I mute a chat yet I still get blasted with notifications on my phone for the chats I have mute 
len ratingthree Either then that does mostly what it should 
len ratingthree At least my phone does not bsod from this app times a day unlike the windows version
len ratingfive Okay 
len ratingfive The solution for remote teams and biz is here teams is the best out there for unity and synchronized work 
len ratingfive Very interactive great for business or pleasure 
len ratingfive Look I think teams is amazing but on iPads not so much 
len ratingfive You see on laptops you can change the type of seat you want in together mode and you can share your screen But on IPad you can t do much So if possible please can you make it amazing on a iPad 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive Love the co worker chat feature 
len ratingfive Lovely app 
len ratingfive Very stable and great features for a connected workforce
len ratingfive It took a while for me to get used to Teams 
len ratingfive I have to admit that I did not want to change over from Skype and I know they are not a one for one comparison 
len ratingfive Once I used Teams for a while I really like the way it is setup 
len ratingfive The phone app works just as well as the desktop program to direct messaging and is even more useful if I don t have my laptop open 
len ratingfive Easy to use super functional and an overall great tool for any workplace 
len ratingfive Increases the level of employee communication as well as the effectiveness it 
len ratingfive Would recommend for any job where communication is vital which is nearly of them 
len ratingfive I can t say enough about this app 
len ratingfive It makes communicating for work a breeze 
len ratingfive I don t use anything else 
len ratingfour Can the contacts get separated from the chats 
len ratingfour Right now it s a drop down and you have to pic off the other 
len ratingfive Tremendous
len ratingtwo I m receiving notifications very late recently 
len ratingtwo I can go to the app and see new messages but then the notification for those messages comes an hour later 
len ratingfive Really seamless and powerful 
len ratingfive It is very efficient to be able to use App on phone while out in the field to attend a meeting 
len ratingfive This has saved me so much driving time 
len ratingfive The only problem with remote meetings is screen size if someone is presenting but that is a hardware not an application issue 
len ratingone Universities please stop using this sh t 
len ratingone The worst application ever for webinars
len ratingthree No replay option on desktop or web
len ratingone Latest version crashes the radio when using CarPlay in my Nissan Maxima 
len ratingone App on phone crashes and the infotainment system in the car reboots
len ratingone The do not disturb allows people to disturb me 
len ratingone Gee I miss Skype The app always shows active chat notification badges and this is a known problem
len ratingthree I have used this app since the pandemic started and it s always been great 
len ratingthree However today I tried to use it for an important meeting but the sign in as guest option is not there 
len ratingthree You didn t take this away did you 
len ratingthree I won t be able to make an account so if you took away this feature I will no longer be able to use the app at all 
len ratingthree please let me know what s going on here 
len ratingfive yeah it s awesome
len ratingone I ve had teams on my phone for over a year due to COVID and the app is awful 
len ratingone At some points I had to uninstall from my phone it was such a nuisance 
len ratingone It frequently rings me for calls that I m not actually getting from people I had three of these false calls this morning an hour before work even started 
len ratingone When you do pick up calls sometimes the icon in the top left showing you re in an active call won t go away even if you hard close out of the app 
len ratingone It s so frustrating to never REALLY be sure whether the call is over and to have the call icon flashing green incessantly 
len ratingone It shocks me that there s so many invasive and disruptive bugs in an app by a company like Microsoft 
len ratingone I would delete it if my workplace did not rely on it so heavily 
len ratingtwo For the last week the Teams app has displayed its red one unread message badge despite there in fact being no unread messages 
len ratingtwo It s really infuriating
len ratingfive It a lot 
len ratingthree So far it s a good app however I m still trying to learn more of its functions 
len ratingthree Still having a hard time navigating 
len ratingthree But the more I use it the better it gets 
len ratingfour I have no complaints other than I wish I could see more of my calendar 
len ratingfour One week isn t enough 
len ratingone  Odd that Microsoft can t figure this out there is a bug where you can t join meetings on the teams app although it can be joined on the desktop version 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingfive Works exactly as you d want it 
len ratingfive Perfect for my work needs 
len ratingfive Super app
len ratingfour The badges don t seem to be working well 
len ratingfour There isn t anywhere I could find that setting 
len ratingfour Notification settings are on but I still don t see badges on the app icon 
len ratingfour Easy to use and clearly organized 
len ratingfour Main issue is how it handles notifications the settings should be easier to customize and message notifications get dropped 
len ratingfour This isn t the biggest issue if you regularly check the app but the messages can sometimes disappear from Notification Center making it difficult to quickly check 
len ratingfour Otherwise the app works as advertised 
len ratingone peepeepoopoopoooopeepee
len ratingfour Teams is great on everything except sharing photos and media via mobile device 
len ratingfour It should be one click to access your photo stream 
len ratingfour Not two clicks to select photos to add to available photos That s pointless and slows the process way down 
len ratingfour Overall Teams has improved since I last used it several months ago 
len ratingfour The latest features make it a valued resource during these pandemic times and makes virtual work more manageable I believe it still struggles or lags a bit in capacity especially when there are more than about people on a virtual call sometimes it freezes or the audio kicks out at the worst time or it just knocks you out even on a more laptop with the latest software and updates However on the bright side it does do much more good than bad and I can only imagine what it s capabilities will be in the non too distant future on a scale of I d give it an so it s definitely on its way to bring a 
len ratingfive My online classes go easy with this app thx for making this app
len ratingfive Love using teams and have been doing so for years 
len ratingfive It s an awesome way to send a quick note or question to someone within your network for a quick reply 
len ratingfive It s also phenomenal for virtual meetings with customers and your team 
len ratingfive It s so easy to learn and use and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a way to meet with people virtually 
len ratingfour Great app share screen is the bad part needs to be more like WebEx
len ratingthree When trying to control a shared screen the sharers option to give control does not appear 
len ratingfive Without sub threads you have to create new convos so it s an ok work around
len ratingone Why do you need over MB 
len ratingone Clean up your cache 
len ratingone I feel as if my every turn at work is watched and calculated 
len ratingone The most intrusive app I have experienced 
len ratingone If you as a business owner or boss need to micromanage people lives on and off the job means you don t have a life 
len ratingone Maybe I should have titled this Get A Life 
len ratingfive This much better than Webex 
len ratingfive A must have for all work from home folks 
len ratingfour  Teams is a great app 
len ratingfour While it is missing some features of the desktop version it works very well on iOS and iPadOS 
len ratingfour If you are not a power user of Teams this app will be perfect for you whenever you are on the go 
len ratingfour It has proven to be stable and responsive 
len ratingfour My only major gripe is it s inability to automatically adjust light and dark mode based on the system theme 
len ratingone While I don t use the mobile application often it appears that Microsoft has chosen to require full network access in order to join a meeting 
len ratingone I can see in very limited circumstances viewing other devices on a network MAY be beneficial to the user but the vast majority of the time this level of access adds no value 
len ratingone There is NO technical reason that I am aware of that would actually REQUIRE access to ALL devices on my network in order to join a meeting 
len ratingone I kept hoping this was just an oversight that would be corrected with future updates however it is becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft just want to gather AS MUCH information about its users WITHOUT giving them any ways to opt out 
len ratingfive I used team in multiply companies and now use a Microsoft surface 
len ratingfive Bill always do his thang mane
len ratingthree Can t get rid of annoying guest version of my account 
len ratingthree I seem to always have a badge icon for something in this account and I d like to be able to turn off badge icons per account 
len ratingthree A constant red number on the app is frustrating 
len ratingfive Just my second week using it and it s a necessary tool to support communication especially with so many organizations continuing with remote work options 
len ratingfive The embedded call and chat features make it feel like you are just one office over when you could be miles apart 
len ratingone After the latest update nobody can hear me 
len ratingfive Great for staying in contact with your team while on the go 
len ratingone  Its not an option like it is on linux or mac i dont want to answer after every time i take a call 
len ratingfive It s easy to stay in contact with all my coworkers and supervisors 
len ratingone My school think it s a good app but no 
len ratingone Like sometimes my classmates even make meetings without the teacher knowing 
len ratingone Zoom is better and my school likes horrible apps
len ratingfive Easy to get ahold of my supervisor
len ratingfour Support for Apple CarPlay is needed 
len ratingthree  Great app and works well on the iPhone and mostly well on iPad 
len ratingthree Bug When the Teams app is side by side with another app the Teams app won t share the camera when on a call 
len ratingthree Bug Switching back to the app while on a call or in a chat also always brings up the keyboard in side by side mode 
len ratingthree This is annoying when on a call after switching back I always have to dismiss the keyboard that comes up 
len ratingthree Functional but often kicks me out forcing me to sign back in constantly
len ratingthree In general work perfect but today Im having so many problems in teams and I don t know why but when I enter a meeting it said this Someone is sharing video 
len ratingthree You re unable to see it due to your admins policy 
len ratingfive Works amazing on iPhone Pro
len ratingtwo  The app needs more work from developers at least on the Apple side 
len ratingtwo I don t have a choice but to use this app since this is the primary communication within the company for whom I remotely work 
len ratingtwo When I get a chat notification the app goes berserk 
len ratingtwo The screen begins wildly flashing and get the message Switching but never goes beyond that 
len ratingtwo I have to go to the desktop computer to finish communicating 
len ratingfive I like the user interface
len ratingone It s a UI disaster but if you want your boss to spy on everything you do you ll love this app 
len ratingfive My most used app in my phone 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft for the stable app 
len ratingfive Appreciate continuous nee and exciting features 
len ratingfive The app works well comms are clear and everything seems to work reliably 
len ratingfive Solid Microsoft App
len ratingtwo If you can avoid using it by all means do so 
len ratingtwo If your company has standardized it due to the E or license package for MS formerly Office not to be confused with Microsoft which the latter is actually a virtual PC you run from a browser LOL 
len ratingtwo Who runs their marketing and product branding 
len ratingtwo But I digress 
len ratingtwo If you use iPad Pro M with magic keyboard and apple pen good luck 
len ratingtwo When you have a TEAMS meeting running and switch to another screen or app there s a chance your keyboard will simply stop working equally a your pen won t work either 
len ratingtwo Have to CMD TAB back and forth putting Pen in its charge spot and using bottom right keyboard icon to switch from on screen to magic and back to sort of force things to work again 
len ratingtwo But it won t last 
len ratingtwo And if you were on Mute and need to go off Mute when all this nonsense happens well you might as well drop the meeting and rejoin 
len ratingtwo Satin and now OPUS CODEC for Teams auto adjusts to deal with poor quality WiFi performance but plays havoc with call meeting quality 
len ratingtwo Notifications are a total muck up 
len ratingtwo Turn them all off but watch as you get non stop notifications anyway 
len ratingtwo Activity alerts are utterly redundant so not sure why that s even in there 
len ratingtwo I know its supposed to notify you of moments in chats and channels where your name is mentioned turning that option off or on does NOTHING but it is quite a mess 
len ratingtwo This is really a half baked version of the PC Desktop and MacBook versions which are far better 
len ratingtwo Want basic meetings to work from your iPad 
len ratingtwo Use Zoom 
len ratingtwo Want to get actual work done across a team 
len ratingtwo Use Slack or JIRA 
len ratingtwo You can t seem to ever delete chats its a setting at the admin level of MS TEAMS in your company but it s a mess too as that takes up your RAM and Cache storage on your phone and iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo Want to use MS Project or newer 
len ratingtwo Good luck 
len ratingtwo The Planner app for MS TEAMS is NOT MS PROJECT 
len ratingtwo It s quite crude and useless when it comes to reports and sorry have to laugh at this GANTTs and Kanban s 
len ratingtwo Want to copy from your company s OUTLOOK app on your ipad to your MS TEAMS Chat good luck with that 
len ratingtwo Copy and paste in the opposite direction 
len ratingtwo Good luck with that too 
len ratingtwo Neither works 
len ratingtwo Terrible app 
len ratingtwo Painful to deal with it 
len ratingtwo I ultimately have to open two devices corporate PC and iPad or corporate PC and iPhone to have good meeting functionality 
len ratingtwo I use the phone or iPad solely for the meeting connect takes seconds instead of half a minute like the desktop takes so I can join the audio and video 
len ratingtwo I use the PC to be able to share apps and screens without crashing sharing apps and multitasking simply don t work reliably if at all on an iPhone nor iPad Pro M the latest iPad Pro as of July 
len ratingtwo It s easy to ADD THIS DEVICE when you join from iPad first then join again from PC 
len ratingtwo Thank goodness or everything would be useless 
len ratingtwo Given the broken keyboard user interface glitches on an iPad Pro M that ONLY happens with MS TEAMS we have no choice but to have dialing keyboards iPad and PC to get things done 
len ratingtwo What a shame that MS has so little product QA in play here with this 
len ratingtwo If Cisco does WEBEX TEAMS properly AND opens it up to beyond the constraints Microsoft inserts they ll have a winner 
len ratingtwo MS is on a short term win spin on O oops MS not to be confused with Microsoft due to their licensing and how many enterprise companies are tied into MS Cloud and licensing solutions 
len ratingtwo But MS will soon hit a plateau and competitors will begin to swiftly displace MS across the boards by early 
len ratingfive Some bugs but overall very powerful
len ratingfour wish their was an annotation tool we use this a lot for the the construction and architecture world 
len ratingfour also wish during a larger group meeting that some participants aren t hidden 
len ratingfour these are two features of zoom that need to be incorporated 
len ratingfour otherwise this is my go to app
len ratingone The mobile Teams app comes packaged with a plethora of bugs and issues it s genuinely difficult to decide where to begin 
len ratingone First off notifications 
len ratingone The system is completely broken 
len ratingone During my shift hours I will receive non stop notifications despite being listed as do not disturb and having channels muted 
len ratingone Second phone calls 
len ratingone This system isn t worth bothering with on mobile 
len ratingone The quality is atrocious and the transferring system doesn t work at all 
len ratingone In a more broad lens Teams as a whole suffers from constant outages 
len ratingone Truly I would never choose to use this service if my employer didn t require it 
len ratingfour Status isn t always accurate though even after a refresh 
len ratingfour Can select to message someone and discover a completely different status for them 
len ratingfive Great and fest best way to stay connected 
len ratingthree Look and feel seem outdated 
len ratingthree Could be a bit more polished with more options to customize 
len ratingfive This flap is very good my company uses it 
len ratingfive Great job Microsoft 
len ratingtwo  When using TEAMS and sharing my video with others if I drag any other app notes Outlook etc to initiate the split screen multitasking my video stops sharing 
len ratingtwo This is really annoying because during meeting or video conferencing it is very useful to have a secondary app to take notes or send emails 
len ratingtwo Please add fix this feature 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingthree Since the last update anytime I make or join a video call on my phone the screen freezes and I end up having to quit the call and use my computer 
len ratingfive I have two incidents to turn on my camera during a meeting 
len ratingfive The camera enable button is too close to the corner and very easy to be touched unintentionally 
len ratingfive The same issue with mute button
len ratingfive Super cool app
len ratingone Microsoft always seems to do things halfway 
len ratingone There s so many half baked ideas that could be good but then they do things such as only give you agenda view in the calendar without an option to switch to week or month 
len ratingone It s frustrating how such a big company can t think of the little things that could make their apps so much more useful 
len ratingthree Where can I find resources to learn more about TEAMS functions usage etc 
len ratingone Crashes constantly on my legacy iPad
len ratingfive This app is very helpful when away from you computer 
len ratingfour I love this app because it s easy to navigate 
len ratingfour Don t like how I have to delete it and re download daily because the gif section doesn t work after a few tries throughout the day 
len ratingfour I guess downloading it resets that section 
len ratingone This app is horrible 
len ratingone You can t multitask while using it and when you re on video it freezes if you have another app open on the side 
len ratingone Hello 
len ratingone Newsflash if I m in a meeting on my notes need to be open as well which means I need to be able to multitask 
len ratingone Also the notifications rarely work even though everything has been set up correctly for notifications to be on 
len ratingone Zoom doesn t have these issues so take a look at them 
len ratingfive Love the mobile version 
len ratingfive I work remotely and don t always have access to my computer and the app is very well developed and simulates the desktop version very well 
len ratingfive Makes working from my phone very convenient 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive Good value
len ratingtwo Well those that think this such a great program haven t shared screen 
len ratingtwo On the iPhone it s a joke and on a surface Pro with all the attendees plastered across the top you cannot make out the font size 
len ratingtwo Teams continues to lag Zoom and I hate Zoom
len ratingone App rarely works on iphone 
len ratingone Clearing cache doesn t work 
len ratingone You have to reinstall every day you want to use 
len ratingone App devs have no idea what they are doing 
len ratingfour The UI is a little clunky but it does work well for a one stop app filling many work related needs 
len ratingfour  successful work leash 
len ratingone Just spent the last few days trying to collaborate with coworkers using this app 
len ratingone We spent more time disconnected than connected 
len ratingone My company went with this product to save cost but we are spending more on labor to get it to work 
len ratingfour I ve been using TEAMS for a couple of years now and it s a solid reliable app that beats prior apps like Skype 
len ratingfour Call quality and stability keeps improving too 
len ratingfour My only gripe is that with the recent update I constantly have a badge within the app showing that I have in read chat when I do not 
len ratingfour If I uninstall the app the badge goes away until I get a message at which point I show unread chats 
len ratingfour When I read that message it goes back to unread chat instead of zero 
len ratingfive It s the best 
len ratingfive I have on my cellphone and laptop 
len ratingfive So easy to communicate 
len ratingfive I can search our conversations for any info I forgot 
len ratingfive It s beautiful 
len ratingone I ve had this on my phone for a couple months and now nothing will load on this or Outlook 
len ratingone I deleted the apps and redownloaded it and it won t let me sign in 
len ratingone It acts like I m not connected to the internet 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfour Thanks and mostly we coordinate work and even our issues with each other 
len ratingfour That way customers will be served by one of the team members of one has an issue or sickness is stopping the individual to work 
len ratingfive Effective and fast
len ratingfive I love Teams 
len ratingfive Personable 
len ratingfive AndVersatile 
len ratingone Things constantly do not load when clicked on 
len ratingone I get blank screens when trying to open notifications 
len ratingone I ve tried wifi and cellular data neither load the way they should 
len ratingone I ll see new messages in my notifications while in the chat the messages are supposed to appear in 
len ratingone Broken apps make sense in 
len ratingone Are they not having someone check for quality assurance 
len ratingone This app is unreliable at the moment 
len ratingone On Pc it works fine but the mobile app on iPhone specifically is trash 
len ratingfive Fast very reliable and doesn t have a time limit on group meetings 
len ratingthree The mic is not working properly 
len ratingthree Often when a class started we can find did a mic is not working amp the sound is low 
len ratingfour  it arranged my chat contacts in alphabetical order and remembered which groups were expanded and collapsed 
len ratingfour SfB was way superior in the chat arena 
len ratingone Imposter would vent again Also vented to North Pole
len ratingone App was working fine for months 
len ratingone Now my data will not update for messages received and calls are glitching 
len ratingone Was just listening to music on my phone with it locked suddenly it s calling my director and now we re both confused on what happened 
len ratingone I can t tell when coworkers are available unless I click into the chat on the app so pretty unhelpful whenever I m not next to my computer 
len ratingfive Not perfect but they seem to get updates out regularly enough to keep it getting better 
len ratingone This app may be great on other devices but has major compatibility issues with the rd gen iPad Pro 
len ratingone Crashes all the time and will not allow me to send invitations for my meeting before crashing every time I select a meeting 
len ratingone Also having major sign in issues 
len ratingone I have attempted signing into different emails and they all have the same sign in error message after entering password 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Easy to communicate
len ratingone The title says it all 
len ratingone The app was amazing 
len ratingone It was able to seamlessly connect from my laptop my phone take calls on the go and even watch presentations 
len ratingone Now 
len ratingone I can t even open my messages 
len ratingone Completely useless 
len ratingone This review will stay up until the issue gets fixed 
len ratingone It has been over month since this has happened and no end in sight 
len ratingone Complete disappointment 
len ratingfive nice to use the app
len ratingone Hope this app dies 
len ratingone Recently the app stopped updating my chats and team pages every day or two after installation I have had to constantly delete and redownload the app 
len ratingone When I do so it works for a day or two then endlessly spins trying to update my data 
len ratingone I still get real time push notifications even though the app itself will not refresh 
len ratingone I am on an iPhone iOS 
len ratingone Problem has been going on for a week or two now 
len ratingone Before that it worked fine 
len ratingone I keep getting sign in error 
len ratingone I ve tried with different accounts still same results
len ratingone Calendar view has not populated in weeks even after updating 
len ratingone Weak app for having supposed competent devs 
len ratingfive Just as easy as the desktop app although we would like a bigger selection of GIFs 
len ratingfive Teams have our team at Waste Management to opportunity to contact in ways never imagined 
len ratingfive To have the ability to reach others within the market area and brainstorm sustainable solutions is incredible 
len ratingfour When sharing your screen it does not update when toggling between reports screens for rest of team viewing like Skype does 
len ratingfour Big miss only issue I ve really had with this app 
len ratingfive Efficient easy to access 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfive This will soon be or already is the best way to have office meetings 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Will also take over the landline system 
len ratingfive My team uses this app and it sure makes things easier to work with each other 
len ratingfive I can also share my screen in a display so my students in the room can see it on the big screen and at the same time folks online and follow thru 
len ratingfive I only wish I could share multiple screens at the same time 
len ratingfive It very easy to use and make communication very easy
len ratingfive Software and app work great 
len ratingfive Great for meetings 
len ratingfive Much better than the competition
len ratingone My company went to this and for the last several weeks myself and my team have had to reinstall this on a daily basis for it to work 
len ratingone It worked well for almost a year but since June it is horrible 
len ratingone It will work for one call and then the very next one it stops 
len ratingone It causes me to be late for meetings 
len ratingone Very unprofessional 
len ratingfive Great way to communicate 
len ratingfive I m a tech idiot 
len ratingfive Born way too early to instinctively understand apps and such 
len ratingfive Unless they are very user friendly 
len ratingfive This seems to be pretty easy to use at least so far 
len ratingfive I m sure I can muck it up eventually 
len ratingfive Love it love it love it 
len ratingfive Hands down the best collaborative app I ve used 
len ratingfive I am impressed 
len ratingfive Microsoft is back in the game 
len ratingfive Very clear to use and major update improvements 
len ratingthree Delivering value to customers is one of the better parts of using Agile to release code but the manifesto also highlights working software 
len ratingthree Please keep that in mind 
len ratingthree I m tired of trying to use this mobile app for work just to have it not open 
len ratingthree All the functionality in the world is pointless if I can t use it 
len ratingfive Excellent service 
len ratingone There was no join meeting button 
len ratingfive It s cool and helpful to maximize my outputs 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive We use it for work and I have downloaded it to my cell phone so that I can be sure not to miss any updates and also I have access to the files so I can study and learn daily 
len ratingfive This app is an awesome way for businesses to link their teams together 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfour  Por favor al igual que se puede compartir pantalla cuando se esta en una reuni n agreguen en futuras actualizaciones la opci n de poder compartir solamente el audio del dispositivo por ejemplo para que los dem s asistentes de la reuni n escuchen una grabaci n en audio sin tener que estar viendo mi pantalla 
len ratingtwo I can t block people on teams idk if it s apart of the school settings that they put but I have been bullied for year by school girls on private chat and I can t block them I keep leaving the group that they bully me in but they keep adding me back I haven t done anything their literally doing this for fun I tired on the bulling HOW DO I BLOCK 
len ratingtwo Please stop switching the status to away automatically 
len ratingtwo This is the most frustrating issue with Teams especiallly on mobile 
len ratingtwo Allow people to set their status however they want and stop forcing the away status 
len ratingone Wish I could give it stars 
len ratingone I have to uninstall the app every time I need to sign in to my company s teams account 
len ratingone Ridiculous waste of time 
len ratingfive  Great app to work 
len ratingfive This app makes me so happy
len ratingfive This app is just great 
len ratingthree My teams app worked great for about a month then suddenly I m not able to get my messages updated and join any meetings unless I delete the app and restart in 
len ratingone Homework is boring 
len ratingfive I like the teams app because I can put assignments also I like it because It looks so cool 
len ratingfive Thanks Bye bye 
len ratingthree Why can we only see week of our calendar
len ratingfive Absolutely love it
len ratingtwo Could you add chat option or auto reply for any calls that been trying to connect when I m in a meeting 
len ratingtwo I cannot rejected calls and I cannot hear the presenters voice 
len ratingtwo For your kind support
len ratingfour This needs a widget 
len ratingfive Really easy to use good quality and great for work chats 
len ratingfive Would recommend 
len ratingfour  Communications collaboration document sharing and app integration all at the fingertips 
len ratingfour In many ways this is ahead of the desktop version 
len ratingfour Supporting personal accounts is welcome and now a must have 
len ratingfour Missing Apple CarPlay support 
len ratingone You would think being such a big company that they would be able to revert back to their previous notification experience 
len ratingone Every time I get a message on desktop and read it it no longer disappears and instead I have to clear hundreds of teams notifications at the end of the day 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS 
len ratingfive Love Teams 
len ratingfive It s so easy to jump in a video call 
len ratingfive The phone reception is amazing never interrupts 
len ratingfive Please keep updating and making it better if that s possible 
len ratingthree If I have my desktop Teams open why is it that my phone gets phantom Teams notifications they appear then instantly disappear causing my phone to activate and making me wonder if I ve gotten a text or something 
len ratingfive I really liked the app as it is friendly used
len ratingtwo Compared to other apps with similar features slack g suite etc 
len ratingtwo it feels so outdated 
len ratingtwo So many features are missing and the layout is incredibly convoluted 
len ratingtwo There are no previews for images videos in folders also which seems absurd not to have included 
len ratingfour There should be an off the record option like google has 
len ratingfour Calendar doesn t always sync immediately seems like it will update in the morning but if a meeting changes throughout the day that change isn t reflected on my teams calendar unless I close the app and open it again 
len ratingone I had many problems with this app while I was distant learning it never worked 
len ratingone The screen sharing was very glitchy and you could never tell what was going on while someone was screen sharing 
len ratingone Also when you were going to mute or unmute the button wouldn t work the teacher had to mute people after they had unmuted 
len ratingone The together mode was trash it never worked 
len ratingone I have seen ads for this app on tv nothing like what they show in the ads 
len ratingone Overall a Bad experience and app 
len ratingtwo The iPhone app has been great so far but computer video call functionality is frequent and consistent ie calls freezing audio pausing and cutting out video not working 
len ratingtwo Speed testing during these issues confirmed it wasn t a network issue 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Wish it had a to do function 
len ratingthree Calls using WiFi sound terrible 
len ratingthree Sounds worse than a land line 
len ratingthree Push notifications rarely happen 
len ratingthree I don t get notifications on all my devices 
len ratingthree Other than those things the app functions much better with every update 
len ratingfour Wish project management was better 
len ratingfive  I am able to be connected on the go increasing my efficiency and response time to my team 
len ratingfive This app is awesome and easy to use 
len ratingfive Having used Teams at work for quite a while I was pleasantly surprised to see how intuitive and seamless the transition is between the desktop version and the app 
len ratingthree We use teams to send out assignments for the next day and recently many people from our staff cannot see the pictures we send 
len ratingthree Often people have to delete the app redownload and then the messages come through 
len ratingthree It s frustrating since the staff depends on their assignments to know what time they need to arrive to work 
len ratingone Can we please fix notifications 
len ratingone badges are still not working properly 
len ratingone New messages does not result in a badge icon letting me know 
len ratingone Have to always open the app to know I have a new message which is useless 
len ratingone Have uninstalled and reinstalled checked all notification settings with no change 
len ratingone MS please fix 
len ratingone Link to report issues is useless so had to resort to a review 
len ratingfive It s good app for work
len ratingthree Uses a considerable amount of data 
len ratingthree Careful of meetings if you re on a fixed data plan 
len ratingthree Have some slight bugs otherwise but it s a great solution 
len ratingfour Make it fast 
len ratingfour Give us caller tune options 
len ratingfour Make it auto update status after office hours and weekend 
len ratingone It was really glitchy and keep kicking me from my meeting
len ratingfour How do I make it so people stop hacking my account 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive MS Team is very stable to use
len ratingfive I work remotely and use teams ALL day when I am on the go this app is very responsive in real time and I rarely have connectivity issues 
len ratingfive Very straight forward UX and pleasant to use 
len ratingfive Not a HUGE Microsoft fan in general but I gotta say I do enjoy Teams 
len ratingone  If you re going to make a theme for pride why can t you make a theme for Christians

len ratingone The lack of CarPlay support is extremely frustrating 
len ratingone I m having to take multiple calls a day in my car 
len ratingone It requires pulling over to access my phone while on the road 
len ratingone WebEx and Zoom both have support 
len ratingone The ability to join a call via CarPlay is a must 
len ratingfive Continuous to add feature on regular basis 
len ratingfive The product team is doing great job in bringing the best to users 
len ratingfive I love the unified experience across all devices I was amazed when I ran a meeting with a power point share through one drive on my mobile 
len ratingthree I like this app but the one thing that would make it even more useful would be to have the ability to use the calendar feature that is available on my laptop 
len ratingthree I have to use a different calendar app for this very inconvenient 
len ratingthree Hope the developers are working to correct that 
len ratingthree When they do I d be happy to give this app stars
len ratingone I hate school stop
len ratingthree Profile picture is updated but not reflected during meetings though signed out from team and logged back in 
len ratingone I can t get back to call screens without closing the app and having to rejoin 
len ratingone Very frustrating overall 
len ratingfour I love this app 
len ratingfour The ability to have everything in one place for the team is very useful and easy for the team 
len ratingfour I do wish there were better alerts for messaging 
len ratingfour It seems we miss messages when someone texts the team at times 
len ratingone Make it like desktop or dont make am app disrespectful
len ratingfive Only thing I wish they would add is custom notification settings related to calls 
len ratingfive Sometimes I don t want to do full DND but don t want to receive phone calls no customizations available there otherwise awesome 
len ratingtwo I just got a message 
len ratingtwo When I tried to log in it told me I needed a pin from my organization 
len ratingtwo After I recovered my pin and signed in the message was gone 
len ratingtwo Dumb 
len ratingfive Using teams seems to be a whole lot easier at least to me then the other platforms for online meetings 
len ratingfive Especially when I need to invite someone who isn t a regular 
len ratingfour I can use it on all my devices
len ratingfive I used to be like oh man I don t like the teams app 
len ratingfive But then I just started using again after several years of them updating and I m like you know what 
len ratingfive it s not that bad 
len ratingthree I miss reminders like Slack offered
len ratingfive Very convenient way to communicate with the entire company
len ratingone the past hrs Teams is Crashing when typing more than characters in the search bar 
len ratingone Something definitely has changed regressed
len ratingfive I like the teams really good 
len ratingfive I just don t like the fact it does not allow to delete old messages or just keep what we want and eliminate what I don t need
len ratingfour It s been many years since I ve had to use Office so extensively and Teams is definitely the biggest surprise of the entire suite of productivity apps 
len ratingfour I really enjoy the ability to chat with team members and the integration with Outlook is great 
len ratingfour I just wish that you could schedule meetings with Team members through iPhone app 
len ratingfour For some reason it s not available 
len ratingone Been waiting minutes for this app to download 
len ratingone Now late for a meeting 
len ratingone Not happy of Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone App loops between Microsoft authenticator and itself infinitely 
len ratingone I can t join a meeting without giving permission to the app to use my iPad s microphone 
len ratingone Come on that s a crappy user experience 
len ratingone Completely not necessary 
len ratingone It s the very first experience I have the app and I already want to wipe it from all my devices 
len ratingfive The only issue I have found so far is the members of each channel are the same as the team and can not be changed 
len ratingfive Seems to be counter intuitive and would require the creation of more teams then needed 
len ratingfive I get to talk with some of my friends from job training school and job day off school 
len ratingfive It is a much better way to communicate with my team members then by texting on the phone 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this app
len ratingone Navigation is and issue 
len ratingone If I am in a file I ALWAYS lose my place when hitting the back button rendering this tool inefficient at best 
len ratingone Separate IM Chat from the rest of the tool or at least pop out the entire thing 
len ratingone If I am chatting I am often also still working allow us to do both 
len ratingone The activity notification feature is redundant inefficient and annoying 
len ratingone I don t need double notifications 
len ratingone Ever 
len ratingone Get some GenZ and Millenial I am a millennial so this isn t a dig in any way to test user experience and make the necessary updates 
len ratingone This tool is frustrating 
len ratingone delete yourself please and change that ringtone of urs
len ratingone iPhone Pro attended to a web meeting and couldn t get video to work 
len ratingone Zoom worked without an issue 
len ratingone So first off there is no way to delete chats so there is unnecessary and very annoying clutter that can t be removed 
len ratingone There isn t even an option to hide a chat despite it saying to do so online 
len ratingone There are no three dots with more options like it says 
len ratingone Second thing getting on my nerves is how the calendar is only accessible on your personal account which renders it completely useless for the actual team channel where you d need to make that information easily accessible to everyone 
len ratingone Same with tasks also only available for your personal account 
len ratingone There is also no way to add your own personal account into your own business channels 
len ratingone So the features locked behind the personal account version at that point could have never been accessed by you or your team anyway 
len ratingone I don t even understand how you could design an app this frustrating and think that it s okay to make it available for other people 
len ratingone I will be searching for other options now 
len ratingtwo Suddenly can t hide the participants icons 
len ratingtwo On a inch screen who at MS decided should go to showing an icons list the entire meeting 
len ratingtwo Give us options 
len ratingtwo Desktop app suddenly enabled this by default as well but a setting called focus mode hides it 
len ratingtwo Amateur hour at MS lately after outstanding design changes during the pandemic 
len ratingfive Teams is a great way to stay connected with the company you are with or you are leading 
len ratingfive It s a great way to communicate while in the field and a great place to keep calendar reminders and to place conference calls quick and easy 
len ratingfive Teams is a solid app for collaboration meetings and phone 
len ratingone Microsoft 
len ratingone  fix this app 
len ratingone It doesn t run well on computers and definitely doesn t run well on the iPhone 
len ratingone Quit trying to add things and fix things that are already there 
len ratingone I m tired of trying to share screens and my audio goes out or I can t share screens or something comes up with the app 
len ratingone Why would you add this theme when there are so many other themes that could be added 
len ratingone Like for instant Military Cancer Awareness Elder Abuse and the list goes on 
len ratingthree  Should be interchangeable from small to big during the call like in what s app 
len ratingthree Please allow users to be able to change others icon colors 
len ratingthree The change can be restricted to the user being the only one able to see the change and not anyone else 
len ratingthree For example All my co workers have a pink icon box and half of them have the initials MM 
len ratingthree So it is super confusing and I message the wrong co workers all the time 
len ratingthree They won t change their icons and I can t click on their icon and change it for only my person view either 
len ratingthree Please change this 
len ratingthree Let users control the colors they see other users as 
len ratingthree And stop setting everyone up with pink 
len ratingthree The whole office is pink 
len ratingone It was working fine until about a week ago 
len ratingone Now I have to delete it every day and redownload every day 
len ratingfour Nice app but has a long way to be perfect 
len ratingfour It s a system resource hog 
len ratingfour That said it s easy to use for team collaboration 
len ratingfive Teams works the way I expect it to 
len ratingfive For the most part pretty similar to the desktop app 
len ratingtwo It is ridiculous that I have to scroll through a whole days worth of teams calls in my IOS phone log to get to my personal call history 
len ratingtwo MS need to add a feature to disable this immediately
len ratingone Cant even log in anymore 
len ratingone Keeps saying cant sign in 
len ratingone Cant keep up with work messages while im out anymore
len ratingone I have organizations on my profile plus the Personal profile that showed up many months ago by self and I can t get rid of it 
len ratingone To make matters worse at times when I get a notification for either of my orgs on my iPhone mini and click on said notification it pulls up Teams but glitches back and forth between the org that has the notification and the personal profile rendering the app useless unless I crash it start it back up and switch to the org with the notification 
len ratingfive I liked it coz of having so many features under one umbrella
len ratingfour Why is there a pride theme in an app for business collaboration 
len ratingone Trams requires that you give is permission to browse all the devices on your network just to join a conference call 
len ratingone I can understand how this might be helpful if I m at an office with Teams enabled conference hardware but I don t want you checking up on my kid s iPad 
len ratingone This feature should be optional not required 
len ratingone Really poor taste on Microsof s part 
len ratingfive Does it s job well 
len ratingfive It has become a vital part of my teams and company s communication even as we return to the office 
len ratingtwo I use Teams regularly for work on my laptop desktop and have recently started using it on an iPad Pro M chip 
len ratingtwo When running on the iPad it kills the battery very fast battery at the end of a min video call and it cooks the iPad deg F exterior temp within mins of video call 
len ratingtwo The iPad becomes too hot to handle comfortably and the screen goes through a series of dimming power down stages just to it keep running 
len ratingtwo I know that Teams is a resource hog from my time on a Windows desktop but there needs to be some serious optimizations and improvements before this app becomes a viable regular work day tool 
len ratingfour Wow yet another messenger application sorta like WhatsApp or similar 
len ratingfour Pretty important to have on your phone so you can be on while out 
len ratingfour Doesn t have font size controls odd or maybe I just haven t found them 
len ratingfive I really enjoyed using the reams app 
len ratingfive I like that I can see my calendar and connect to calls through the calendar 
len ratingfive I like that I can text chat or video chat 
len ratingfive It s very user friendly 
len ratingfive I ve used a similar app and I like this one way better 
len ratingone On the iPhone it crashes anytime sound is in phone mode and you pick it up to listen 
len ratingone Fix the bug 
len ratingfour I love Teams but I would love it even more with a Walkie Talkie option for IOS 
len ratingthree I ve been using the mobile app since the beginning and I really enjoy it 
len ratingthree However the biggest pain point is the fact that it does not work with Apple CarPlay 
len ratingthree Anytime I have to join a meeting it triggers my car Consol into restarting every time it detects that I m on a teams call which is not helpful when you have to join a meeting on the way to the office 
len ratingthree  I live two hours away from an office 
len ratingthree  It would be great if someone could fix that lack of compatibility 
len ratingthree I d would like to be to open a team group
len ratingone If I mute a chat why in the heck do you have my phone get bombarded with pop ups every time somebody writes something in the chat 
len ratingone I want to receive notifications from UNMUTED chats but NOT from MUTED chats 
len ratingone This is driving me insane 
len ratingone I hate it if it wasn t for work I wouldn t even bother with this app so far had to delete and redownload this app times because it kept glitching on me
len ratingthree Hay guys appreciate the hard work but really need the CarPlay integration hopefully this is dropping soon
len ratingone It kick my son out
len ratingfive Really like this app 
len ratingfive Hi Im using teams to my classes but cant upload images to the personal folder in teams files 
len ratingfive When uploading its not the jpg format so my teacher cant view the image 
len ratingfive I changed the camera config to more compatible but still having the problem 
len ratingfive Need solution please help 
len ratingfive THANK YOU 
len ratingfour Teams has been valuable in scheduled and ad box collaborating 
len ratingfour Personal audio has dropped routinely dropped during meetings or there was no audio at all 
len ratingfour A mobile phone with the Teams app needs to be used and readily available as a back up for meetings 
len ratingone I WANT CHAT BACK 
len ratingone I CANT TEXT MY FRIENDS AND CALL THEM ANYMORE AND ITS YOUR FAULT 
len ratingone Teams removed the option for Available from the Duration to set a status 
len ratingone The app automatically sets you as Inactive after minutes of non activity This is a terrible change as I often have to take pen to paper to calculate plan for aspects of my job and now I am more distracted and therfore less productive throughout the day making sure I swipe my mouse every two minutes so I don t appear to not be working 
len ratingone I got so much more done before they changed it 
len ratingone Now I can t fully focus on what I m doing anymore 
len ratingone Awful 
len ratingfive App is very useful 
len ratingone When I first got Microsoft teams I obviously thought it was you know amazing and that I was going to help me in so many ways but I ve been seeing that it actually is like a terrible app because it distracts me and it glitches a lot like what I m trying to do my work it just signed me out and it s really terrible because it doesn t save the work by itself
len ratingone I actually do love this app but many of my colleagues and I do not receive alerts on our phones 
len ratingone We won t see messages until we actually open the app or we ll see them on our lock screen but will not have received an audible or haptic notification 
len ratingone This seems to be pretty widespread for some time now 
len ratingone A corporate messaging system that does not alert you promptly is extremely frustrating and can make you look bad especially in today s remote workforce 
len ratingone Please address this ASAP Microsoft 
len ratingone Thanks in advance 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone I have had Teams on my iPad for a while now but last week Teams logged me out of my work account and now I can t log back in 
len ratingone When I put in my work credentials it prompts me to make a new account 
len ratingone I already have a work issued account which I m logged into on my iPhone and laptop 
len ratingone I assume this was due to the app update but it is incredibly frustrating 
len ratingthree I m not able to receive any notification on my mobile ios with the ne app update about a week ago 
len ratingthree All the notifications options are turned on 
len ratingfive Sometimes your call button doesn t work
len ratingthree Wish there was a way to edit and or delete comments 
len ratingfour  UPDATED Surprised that these updates have not yet come to the app 
len ratingfour Reducing rating for now 
len ratingfour Microsoft has created a truly outstanding tool that has proved itself invaluable with regards to remote working from an iPad iPhone 
len ratingfour A few items that need to be addressed To match the functionality of Zoom on iPad OS the camera should remain on when in slide over split screen mode 
len ratingfour This is ESSENTIAL 
len ratingfour  On iPad allow users to open chat participant list in a sidebar while still viewing the participants in the call 
len ratingfour The fact that the entirety of the screen is taken up by chat and participant list is a major frustration when monitoring groups and or chat 
len ratingfour  In call support keyboard shortcuts for muting unmuting opening chat participant list at a minimum 
len ratingfour  Ability to manage breakout rooms via iPad OS 
len ratingfour  The ability to edit meeting notes Wiki from the iOS app 
len ratingfour Thanks for all the fantastic work on the app 
len ratingfive Fun easy to use tool 
len ratingfive The best chat app for enterprises hands down assuming your organization uses O 
len ratingone The app worked fine 
len ratingone Nothing out of the ordinary except for call quality sometimes randomly turning to crap but overall it was an ok app 
len ratingone But with the latest update OMG this app has turned into an absolute heap of trash 
len ratingone Every time Teams notifications appear and or I have to get into the app the Teams startup screen loads and then it freezes 
len ratingone But here s the kicker not only does it just freeze it crashes my phone so badly that my home button stops working 
len ratingone Everything stops working 
len ratingone It prevents me from getting into any other app 
len ratingone And all that my iPhone shows is this irritating Teams start screen 
len ratingone It has been continuously happening with the latest update 
len ratingone And now every time I load Teams it trashes my iPhone and the only solution for me to be able to use my phone is to do a hard reset by long pressing the sleep wake and volume down button 
len ratingone This is the kind of garbage that makes me despise Microsoft and keep away from most of their products 
len ratingfive  Really like this
len ratingthree Team might be one of functional and full featured applications in this areas but definitely need to work on the UX UI I can rely on teams calls and massaging system notification delivery etc more than slack and monday but they armed with a better user experience easier to find easier to work with and beautiful DLS design language system 
len ratingone The worst app
len ratingthree It s good but on iPhone I can t see the bubbles color on a persons profile to check there availability without opening their profile 
len ratingtwo Mobile notifications for Teams work about of the time 
len ratingtwo Even when Teams on my laptop is off laptop shutdown it won t always alert my phone 
len ratingtwo Sometimes it is fine but often no alerts 
len ratingtwo It acts like I m still on the laptop 
len ratingtwo The only way around this is to have it alert my phone all the time even when I m active on desktop 
len ratingtwo That is annoying 
len ratingtwo Slack just works 
len ratingtwo It rocks 
len ratingtwo But our company won t pay for Slack so we all have to use Teams 
len ratingfour Could be better designed but ok overall 
len ratingfour Battery drain is fairly large if used on a long term 
len ratingthree You can t expect perfection too early need more emojis 
len ratingfive Really appreciate a fully integrated platform instead of separate apps that work half as well slack zoom gsuite 
len ratingfive It just keeps getting better and better 
len ratingthree How do you lg out is my frustrating adventure 
len ratingthree There is no where to do this 
len ratingfour I use this as a volunteer 
len ratingfour Several training sessions and meetings that I get invited to each month 
len ratingfour I have used it on my iPhone and and laptop 
len ratingfour Thanks to a mistake on my part the laptop that I use now takes several minutes to load teams 
len ratingfour I prefer the laptop because it is easier to see shared information on screen 
len ratingfour I can not setup any groups on my iPhone unless I send an invitation immediately 
len ratingfour As the team lead I wanted to have everyone in a group before setting up an event 
len ratingfour I prefer to organize things so I just click on a group send the invite and then work on other things 
len ratingfour If there is a way to do this the app is not very forthcoming with the info 
len ratingfour This also why I do not like being hounded to do a review when I have only just started to work with the app for myself instead of clicking the invites sent by others 
len ratingone IT IS SO STUPID 
len ratingfive Love how teams is able to connect us while out on the field 
len ratingfive I love it I use it for school all the time it s a nice app to have its educational and I don t know what else to say about this app I just LOVE it like omgg 
len ratingthree Wish there was a better cross functionality between the computer and the mobile version 
len ratingthree I wish if one mutes it would on all devices 
len ratingthree Work on audio as it drops often otherwise I love it 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate 
len ratingfive Without Teams working from home would be a lot more challenging 
len ratingfive I know there s a lot of similar collaboration type apps available but Microsoft Teams is by far my favorite 
len ratingfive It can be integrated with almost any other program making it a must have 
len ratingthree Still seems like a bunch of parts bolted together with a focus of supporting SharePount 
len ratingthree The apps are list focused but need to get deeper into the apps like forum tools to really be a valid communication II to user bases 
len ratingone FIRST IT ALWAYS LAGS ON ME WHEN I CALL SOMEONE SECOND THEY SAMMED ME AND STOLE MY ACCOUNT THIRD ITS NOT GOOD IT HAS BAD THINGS AND DONT YOU DARE DELETE IT I WANT THE PEOPLE TO SEE HOW BAD IT IS 
len ratingone A loop of verification codes 
len ratingone Someone sat around and designed this 
len ratingtwo I wish it had the feature of Zoom as I 
len ratingtwo Ability to mirror the image during video call 
len ratingone Microsoft teams is the worst app in the market for online learning if your school is using this trash for learning be sure to snuff your principle in their face
len ratingfive  thumbs up 
len ratingone Takes forever to download
len ratingone The past week on the iPhone this app stops working can t connect won t sing in 
len ratingone Pure crap
len ratingfive This has made the change from work world to real world very effective 
len ratingfive Easy way to communicate with a lot of people at once 
len ratingone Why does teams want access to my local network now 
len ratingone I think not 
len ratingfive Excellent app for online education 
len ratingthree Updated this morning 
len ratingthree My account was logged out and now when I click on my account to rejoin I get a prompt to create a new account under that name 
len ratingthree How about a fix 
len ratingfive It s a must for ANY team that wants to be connected for productivity and moral 
len ratingfive Teams is the best 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and has the best chat features 
len ratingfive It makes group chats at work fun 
len ratingfive Not to mention it s much more user friendly than web ex 
len ratingfive Big fan of teams
len ratingfive Great platform and easy to use 
len ratingfive In this era of virtual work this has made meetings seamless and easy to hold and organize 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingfive Nice tool to keep working from home
len ratingtwo Teams is sooo inferior to Zoom that it boggles my mind how it rates higher than three stars
len ratingfive I am a user of Teams but it wasn t by choice 
len ratingfive Turns out I like every element of Teams quite a bit 
len ratingfive It is a true hub for collaboration and it is feature rich 
len ratingfive It runs stable on all of my devices and I have not a single complaint 
len ratingthree AirPods not being compatible with teams is the dumbest most frustrating thing about this app 
len ratingfour Sometimes when a scheduled meeting starts it would be good if get a notification saying meeting started on the mobile 
len ratingfour Otherwise so far I like it 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingfive Love it awesome
len ratingtwo I love this program in my work environment only because nothing like this existed in the work environment before and it s unmatched in that market 
len ratingtwo That being said Microsoft is only catching up to what online gamers have been doing for decades collaborating and working together in massive scales virtually 
len ratingtwo Programs like discord etc all offer similar features with x better performance 
len ratingtwo Microsoft teams is such a laggy system they risk the chance of a competitor coming out offering anything similar to being dropped purely over performance in the work environment 
len ratingthree Please fix this you can t view assignments anymore so I can t see what I got 
len ratingone Does what I need it to for the most part 
len ratingone However the most recent update is a major battery drain 
len ratingone My battery used to last me two days between charges now it s less than hrs ever since the last update 
len ratingfive I am loving the convince of teams for meetings and for chatting with co workers 
len ratingfive The software is great 
len ratingone  As if recent update badges are not working properly 
len ratingone Have uninstalled and reinstalled checked all notification settings with no change 
len ratingone MS please fix 
len ratingone Link to report issues is useless so had to resort to a review
len ratingthree  You have done a really good job with the app 
len ratingthree You just need to follow though on the promised CarPlay support to keep up with zoom and Webex 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Just why when there are so many other easy to use video conferencing apps when I get invited to a Teams meeting all I think is wow he must be new at this whole video conferencing thing 
len ratingthree I enjoy using the teams app on my phone more than how Teams is used on my regular computer 
len ratingthree On my computer it is cumbersome and creates more work 
len ratingfive Good job Microsoft
len ratingone When my phone is on silent and someone calls me from Teams the call comes through and inevitably disrupts what I m trying to do usually sleep 
len ratingfour Still more confusing than Slack
len ratingone This app is so glitchy and dumb it doesn t allow to talk to our friends anymore it so horrible you glitchy and laggy to nobody download it please I have warned you
len ratingone It kicks me out all the time and it crashes all the time 
len ratingone And it does not load
len ratingone This is the worst app to ever be downloaded on my iPad 
len ratingone It kicks me out for absolutely no reason it s pointless to ever login 
len ratingone They do not listen to our reviews so I don t know why people love this 
len ratingone Please Microsoft 
len ratingone FIX YOUR APP 
len ratingone Updated to the latest version but now the app crashes within a few seconds of turning on mic camera which makes it impossible to actually participate in a meeting 
len ratingone Bcusjxuejxienjxjejxekfnjsrnjxejcjejfjejjfjdrjjfjcjfjdjd ricjshdjejdjxjddjdjdjdjdjdjdjxjjc jfj jixsjsjdjsjjxcjicdj I jfj jxjxjducuduxuxhduudxhdhdhdh amp amp amp amp

len ratingone Yummy
len ratingfive There are problems but now I can go to school 
len ratingone Stupid
len ratingthree The app is decent but there needs to be a way to stop getting the pop up when someone is out the office 
len ratingthree Once we X out once we shouldn t get notified again that day 
len ratingthree It s annoying 
len ratingone this app is cancer
len ratingone It glitches
len ratingfive It s an app where you can chat your friends and family members it is so fun to use and I just love it 
len ratingfive You can chat it s really really fun to use 
len ratingone Deamn teams
len ratingone STUPID
len ratingone Viewing assignments on mobile no longer works 
len ratingone  One of the worst devices that keeps on glitching my devices to its doom 
len ratingone It just crashes regularly and is always causing my device to force shut down and lose all of its battery 
len ratingone Also don t forget the lack of Freedom to manage stuff on it factual advice don t install it 
len ratingone My personal opinion T R A S H 
len ratingthree  Teams is fine 
len ratingthree The only issue I have is not being able to set the Away Inactive timer 
len ratingthree It seems to be set as a default minutes without any keyboard activity 
len ratingthree This should be a user timing preference 
len ratingthree Even AOL Messenger had it 
len ratingthree No se pueden ver ni abrir las asignaturas est n bugeadas deber an de arreglar eso tambi n en micr fono y la c mara se prenden solas mal desarrollada la actualizaci n la verdad 
len ratingone The Teams Mac app is great iPhone app not so much 
len ratingone When I am in video meeting with multiple people I have had trouble with it dropping network connection and overheating my iPhone 
len ratingone I have done a number of meetings using WebEx and it does not have the same issues 
len ratingone This is the worst app ever it s so slow and there s constantly bugs and glitches 
len ratingone The moment one bug is fixed ANOTHER ONE APPEARS 
len ratingone Once covid is over I don t ever want to look at this logo ever again 
len ratingone x
len ratingtwo App has been inconsistent 
len ratingtwo Sometimes it s quality and stable 
len ratingtwo Other times it s the opposite especially for gifs 
len ratingone fix the app 
len ratingone when i click view assignment it wont let me 
len ratingone it defeats the purpose of me having the app when i cant view my assignments and do them on my phone 
len ratingone please fix 
len ratingtwo Am getting calls from team on mobile but on checking with my colleagues they did not made calls 
len ratingtwo This keeps happening
len ratingtwo All my Apple apps work voice memo video and Siri 
len ratingtwo However since I updated the my iPad Pro to the microphone stopped working in teams and every other non Apple vendor application 
len ratingtwo I was reading that the new tracking might have something to do with the problem 
len ratingtwo It s obviously not a hardware error and I m sure it s a Apple IOS hidden setting or bug 
len ratingtwo My teams still works on my iPhones so it s probably just the iPad Pro nd Gen My privacy setting is enabled for the microphone 
len ratingtwo Please fix either Microsoft or Apple 
len ratingtwo I m sure you will each blame the other 
len ratingfive Excelente herramienta para seguir adapt ndonos al nuevo mundo 
len ratingone Worst app ever 
len ratingone Typical microsoft app it s complicated and it always takes forever to connect and the it bugs especially on the desktop if I could give it a zero I would 
len ratingfour i can t open assignments what the heck dude why it s fine but it s near the end of school and i cannot open my hecking assignments 
len ratingthree Status doesn t update to available when I open the app now
len ratingtwo  unable to open assignments
len ratingfour Im in th grade it says im in nd grade
len ratingfour Sheeeeeeesh
len ratingfive Created many collaborations across teams 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfour Calls and meetings work well 
len ratingfour Push notifications are great 
len ratingfour I REALLY miss the ability to filter and group team schedules on the phone like in the computer 
len ratingfour It was there then boom just gone which stinks 
len ratingfour Also wish when I am on my computer it wouldn t push notifications to my phone and eat up battery 
len ratingfour Otherwise it works great 
len ratingtwo It s a really nice working hub with meetings and conversations I wish they could pin the conversations like the desktop version does 
len ratingtwo And also create a draft conversation for user itself only to drop random memos rather than opening another window 
len ratingtwo Teams have been having a lot of connection problems recently too can t open the meeting and etc 
len ratingfour Teams has really increased their video conference call quality in the past year and have made some great improvements to shared spaces 
len ratingfour The app even works well for a mobile experience in managing my work project groups and conversations 
len ratingfour I cannot stress how well this application is put together and for managing small and varied groups of work it really helps get the job done 
len ratingfour My only difficulty with teams is that using it as a company wide platform means I have an abundance of active teams spaces and conversations are hard to manage or even maintain 
len ratingfour Currently using another application Slack for a lot of the small desk chats I need for my team because teams feels a little too hectic to manage those alongside my larger projects 
len ratingfive I m convinced that all the stars are teachers teams is always slow literally just stupid in general
len ratingfour I m convinced that teams has a bug because no matter how much reinstall the app it won t let me interact with my assignments on my phone and iPad which defeats the whole purpose of downloading the mobile app
len ratingthree Need to delete messages one by one 
len ratingthree It s super difficult 
len ratingthree Also sometimes messages are not getting refreshed in the window
len ratingone  Why isn t MS testing this adequately before releasing the application
len ratingone Updated the app on and every time I try to access the Outlook calendar it causes the app to crash 
len ratingone Horrible user experience 
len ratingone Dosent left me see my assignments
len ratingthree The all was great at the start don t get me wrong 
len ratingthree But then I ve been having a bug or a glitch that when I tap on a assignment it doesn t let me open it 
len ratingone Before the last update I could use my phone whole day without recharging and using Teams now my battery is drained within hrs if I use Teams 
len ratingone Really bad update 
len ratingone It is so bad that I don t want to use the app anymore just use my laptop so that my battery doesn t drain completely 
len ratingfive Teams app is super user friendly everything is Clean and Neat 
len ratingfive Meetings are a breeze great quality 
len ratingfour Great app to keep the office informed 
len ratingfour Sign in everyday the only drawback 
len ratingfour But otherwise fantastic app to send all office word PPT and other products 
len ratingfour I have been using teams for the past year and a half for school work 
len ratingfour It has worked fine with minimal bugs 
len ratingfour But recently something that is VERY annoying started happening 
len ratingfour Essentially the only way for me to open an assignment is to go to the assignments section 
len ratingfour Not through a channel or messages 
len ratingfour This may seem just like a petty thing but this means I can t see it when assignments are returned back 
len ratingfour I hope I either figure out a way to fix this or it gets patched 
len ratingfour Overall great app though 
len ratingfour The only reason why I gave it four stars is because you can t delete conversation 
len ratingone not able to veiw assignment in assignments section only in ios android and windows work fine
len ratingthree First of all it is soooo glitchy and it freezes and it is not my internet 
len ratingthree I had to switch from zoom to this and I and my teachers definitely regret it I mean they keep adding upgrades but it does nothing it just keeps on getting worst 
len ratingthree Challenging to join when a caller doesn t have good audio and min on their computer 
len ratingthree Wish their was a dial in option 
len ratingthree I would give it stars but the connection is ok but the thing is that when you leave the app it automatically turns off the camera which is annoying while ur in class since the teachers are gonna ask for it to be on but your working on word or something 
len ratingthree I would suggest that they can make it so the camera doesn t turn which would help us students a lot 
len ratingthree Or just make it so while in microsoft apps it stays on 
len ratingthree Hope you read this 
len ratingfour I telecommute and in my years here I ve never met a single co worker including my supervisor in person 
len ratingfour So I say do the next best thing 
len ratingfour Make yourself presentable 
len ratingfour  turn on the camera 
len ratingfive I think it s great 
len ratingfive Keeps everyone in touch with each other and makes it easy to get in touch with one another if we need to find out something quick 
len ratingthree Feature wise it s a great app 
len ratingthree It still needs a lot of work before it can replace a business telephony 
len ratingthree CallKit support is a bit buggy attempted to open a ticket and have received no response 
len ratingthree Very spotty on cellular data compared to other VoIP apps 
len ratingthree it s a great app but right now I can t do my work on my phone because of teams it is tripping it doesn t let me open any assignment it s kinda annoying so if teams can fix that ASAP that would be good cause school is about to end too
len ratingfive I have been using teams since I was hired last summer 
len ratingfive Love this comminucat platform 
len ratingfive Rarely ever encounter a moment where glitches and crashes occur at least for iOS 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive Por favor
len ratingone It s sad to see that any developer and even sysadmins are too lazy to be able to do their job 
len ratingone Instead they want users to do their job for them while collecting large salaries because they don t know how to make their apps and their website secure nowadays 
len ratingone They just want the salary and a social status to validate how wonderful they think they are 
len ratingone I work with sysadmins and developers and they always use the excuse of I m told I have to do things like this because they don t want to be the one who s to blame for their actions Stop being a lazy spoiled child and behave like a mature adult 
len ratingone  Wiki is worthless 
len ratingone  Teams on the iPhone is Ok but it s a bloated app that continues to get bigger because there is no way to clean the caches it creates 
len ratingone The last update added a feature to devour approximately of my battery every hour to sit in the background in hopes of a message coming in that it could tell me about 
len ratingone The overall usability is sightly worse than any other app in this space most notably slack 
len ratingone But because you are likely using it because you have office for work or school you ll use it any way 
len ratingone  Hi Thank you for sharing your feedback one of our resolutions for is to trim down our size while providing even more useful functionality 
len ratingone If you can provide more specific information on how we can improve on we will defin
len ratingone The app is fine but the biggest low hanging fruit is that you cannot match the system s appearance light dark 
len ratingone This is a no brainer 
len ratingone It s good app but right now I m having problems like when teachers sent me like an assignment to return i click it to see and it does not let me open the assignment plz hope you fix this thank you
len ratingone I have a daughter and this teams thing is horrible 
len ratingone She can t communicate with her teacher on it your not able to join the calls or turn in the assignments 
len ratingone I DON T recommend this 
len ratingone It s just terrible 
len ratingone Please do not get it 
len ratingthree Overall the Teams app is useful way to stay connected while not at your laptop 
len ratingthree However there needs to be improvements on the calls function 
len ratingthree It s too easy to accidentally call out when on the calls tab 
len ratingthree This is especially frustrating when you were on a group call and have to apologize to multiple people 
len ratingthree This can be remedied by including a prompt like iPhone has 
len ratingthree Also it would be great if Teams phone numbers could receive and send SMS texts I m want to use the Teams call functionality as it easy to have one number for clients and colleagues 
len ratingthree Please add these functionalities soon 
len ratingone It wont load or show anything I submit 
len ratingone Mainly of all most of the problems aren t from internet connections but rather from bugs and problems that occur from Microsoft 
len ratingone Especially when it happens to students that can t join their class 
len ratingone Really for now the only thing i can do is just tell teachers Teams is having problems when students have assignments due 
len ratingone The glitches an slowness the app has is immeasurable 
len ratingone It was really good at the start but after months passed i ve been experiencing the problem nonstop 
len ratingone I really hope Microsoft can up their game and fix his major issue 
len ratingone It s not letting me click open my assignments anymore it s been doing it for a week now
len ratingone whenever my teacher sends back an assignment it s not letting me open it and it s getting really frustrating 
len ratingone My assignments are not opening I restart app and reinstall app and restart my mobile I m a student but still not working can you fix it please
len ratingfour I tap view assignment and it does nothing
len ratingone Trash
len ratingfour Teams is good only reason for not hovering star is it does not game dial in option for meetings 
len ratingfour And the teams back ground is not as catchy as Skype
len ratingfour I d like to be able to toggle between chat and contacts more easily but other than that I like it 
len ratingfour I just downgraded it to stars though because you made me enter a nickname to leave a comment then rejected most of my nicknames
len ratingthree We need a way to Connect to teams call using a phone number 
len ratingone It may be the new update but recently Teams doesn t let me view assignments when I click on the assignment the button turns grey but the assignment doesn t open 
len ratingfour My main issue is that I have a hard time taking calls on teams using AirPods AirPods Pro 
len ratingfour The audio drops from either one or both of my AirPods sometimes before the call even starts or during 
len ratingfour Fix this for that last star
len ratingthree I have to follow external links to join Teams Meetings 
len ratingthree They do not show up anywhere on the app 
len ratingthree I literally cannot join a meeting through the app 
len ratingthree Fix this 
len ratingthree Overall video quality is very good but this app drains my battery significantly faster than competing apps 
len ratingthree It s important to have your phone plugged in if you want to join a teams meeting or else you ll be done early not by choice 
len ratingfive This is a good app don t get me wrong but I cant open my assignments for school 
len ratingfive Can you guys fix this 
len ratingone Worst app ever
len ratingone die 
len ratingone  This app refuses to re join a meeting until I give it access to my local network 
len ratingone No way 
len ratingone Apple you should remove this spyware 
len ratingone  I HATE THIS APP SM LIKE I CANT EVEN DESCRIBE HOW MUCH YOU LITERALLY RUINED MY WHOLE AND WITH THE PANDEMIC ITS EVEN WORSE PLEASE TAKE THIS OFF THE APP STORE I WOULD BE SO HAPPY AND THANKS YOURS IHATETEAMS
len ratingthree add a block button brov although it s a school app there s a lot of perverts on it
len ratingfive Great app to organize projects and stay on top of tasks 
len ratingfive Microsoft needs to allow for far more flexibility in modifying channels and staying in sync with SharePoint 
len ratingfive Def has the potential to be MS s most impactful software 
len ratingtwo  unable to open assignments
len ratingfive I don t usually write comments but the Teams app is better than the desktop windows version 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive It is how I work on the go and of all the Microsoft apps I have on my phone for work and I have all of them hands down this is the best and must have 
len ratingthree I don t normally write a review for an app but since this is an important one I figured I would 
len ratingthree I ve recently run into a bug or a glitch of some kind where I cannot open any recent assignments that were posted 
len ratingthree This is not good since I use the app for school 
len ratingthree I will click the view assignment button but it just goes grey then nothing happens 
len ratingthree I ve tried deleting the app then re downloading it but that didn t work either 
len ratingthree If there is any solution please let me know 
len ratingthree  Christian Vandiver 
len ratingone garbage
len ratingthree With the last update the background you choose takes over the user now you need to be extremely close to the camera to make it work otherwise you will be blurred or behind the image you selected as background 
len ratingthree I am using an iPhone Pro Max 
len ratingthree Dear developer can you comment on this issue 
len ratingthree Maybe I am the only one having this problem I uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice with the same result 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingone Mal funcionamiento malo malo cc
len ratingfive Teams has always been a solid choice for a workplace collaboration application platform 
len ratingfive However over the last year or so the product and dev teams at MS have added more useful features and a truly great user experience 
len ratingfive Seriously Teams is now a masterclass in how to create a platform that seamlessly works between desktop and tablet mobile 
len ratingfive I m an Apple fanboy at heart but I had to give MS some credit with this one 
len ratingthree Overall Teams works pretty well 
len ratingthree Having it on mobile frees me from being tethered to my computer for communication within my company 
len ratingthree However there is an issue with the latest update to the app on both iOS and iPadOS 
len ratingthree I can make and receive calls to an individual but Teams is asking for Local Network Access to start or join meetings 
len ratingthree It didn t need this permission before and I don t see why it does now 
len ratingthree This behavior is the same on WiFi and Cellular data connections and began with the update on the week of May or 
len ratingfour For the past few days the assignments on Teams aren t opening for me I tried deleting the app restarting my device etc 
len ratingfour  amp its still not letting me open assignments 
len ratingfive Very very good streaming 
len ratingfive I like Teams 
len ratingone It s been good all year but I can t open my assignments now for some reason 
len ratingone Any of them 
len ratingfour Overall I find the app easy to use 
len ratingfour I wish notifications between my desktop app and phone app synced better 
len ratingfour Especially voicemails that I ve listened to deleted on one still show up on the other and can t be deleted 
len ratingfour Why isn t teams able to open the links with the app 
len ratingfour We use teams for class and exams 
len ratingfour Every time I click on the link the web browse opens the link thus closing the camera window 
len ratingfour Many other social networking apps are able to open the link within the app 
len ratingfour Would appreciate if Microsoft can fix this 
len ratingtwo  Tasks by planner no longer works 
len ratingtwo Says it s no longer supported but still has the menu option for it and the desktop client still has this application 
len ratingone Absolutely no reason this app should require local network access 
len ratingone It use to work just fine without it 
len ratingone No internet access does not require giving local network access permission 
len ratingone Local network access should be optional 
len ratingone The message is misleading too 
len ratingone Says local access is required to join calls 
len ratingone But it is only required because MS wants to map your network no need for local network in order to make an internet call join a meeting 
len ratingone Privacy fail 
len ratingone Developer fail 
len ratingone Policy fail 
len ratingone User unfriendly 
len ratingtwo I am still learning teams and all the different ways to use while at work but so far is a good system
len ratingone I m sad very sad haha
len ratingone  Enough said 
len ratingone Don t use this app 
len ratingone In fact don t use any app whose privacy policy allows it to store essentially all of your personal contacts photos videos addresses purchases financial info location and potentially even record what you re typing or speaking 
len ratingone Thank you Apple for forcing companies to disclose how they monitor their users 
len ratingthree Unable to open activity assignments files at sudden 
len ratingthree No setting or anything else changed same file opening in other device Pl help
len ratingthree Everything is alright but when my teacher makes an assignment I can t open it if I click it it won t work at all can you please fix this issue so I can do my work 
len ratingthree  It s an ok app it s always lagging out when I go to turn in my assignment it lags it so it undoes my turned in hw 
len ratingthree Also when we share our screen it s so laggy also when my teacher shares her screen for videos the app can t stand up with it also it kicks me out the app sometimes
len ratingone Waking up every morning to log onto this disgraceful app for school is unenjoyable 
len ratingfive Please add chat Themes and add games in the chats 
len ratingthree The app is fine 
len ratingthree The fact I m badgered to write a review and I can t opt out permanently is quite annoying 
len ratingfive I have no complaints 
len ratingfive I think it uses up a decent amount of bandwidth on my laptop but the mobile version is flawless 
len ratingfive I m not a PC fan whatsoever I use this just for work 
len ratingfive And it s exceptional 
len ratingfive A little more control over channel notifications would be nice but it s a rockstar 
len ratingthree  This is a great app to chat with but it is really buggy on iPhone like it won t open assignments
len ratingone No 
len ratingone We are all working from home we ve gained pandemic weight and we dislike anything in person a d now you re updating the app to AUTO JOIN WITH VIDEO 
len ratingone Why would you do this 
len ratingone Terrible idea 
len ratingone  do not recommend 
len ratingthree Not allowing me to open up assignments for school 
len ratingtwo When the teacher send the home work back after checking when I press view it s not responding and cant see the Techer comments about the home work
len ratingone I don t want camera mirroring effect 
len ratingone Fix it please 
len ratingfive I love having the teams apps on my phone it s awesome tool who will be able to use on the go and keep contact with your work related team thank you
len ratingone Microsoft teams is really a nice app to use it is not complicated I use it for chatting with my friends same for studying but with this new update everything went worse 
len ratingone My friends and I cannot see the shared screen 
len ratingone The teacher nor is can share whatever we want 
len ratingone Third Microsoft teams is glitching and they are kicking me out of the meeting a lot 
len ratingone I am sure this is from the new update 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS 
len ratingfive Zero complaints 
len ratingfive Microsoft knocked it out of the park with this one
len ratingone I can t open any assignment since Friday 
len ratingone You must fix it we need to hand in our projects we won t be able to do the quizzes also until you fix it 
len ratingfive pretty okay app 
len ratingfour  It not letting me open assignment fix it or I will beat you up
len ratingone I have tried signing in to the app this whole week with no success my account information is fine but signing in is always stopped short by a try again message for no apparent reason 
len ratingone I ve missed out on scheduled meetings because of it and it s so disappointing given that I spend two hours of my time before the meetings just trying to get this app to cooperate with me with no success 
len ratingone It lags so muchhhhh
len ratingone I downloaded this app and now my phone is messed up 
len ratingone I no longer have video and my phone has this weird green blinking clock thing happening 
len ratingone I want to UNINSTALL this mess but I can t find the info to do that 
len ratingtwo My hospital switched to this over WebEx for our mobile therapy sessions and I don t like it at all 
len ratingtwo The audio and visual is always lagging and cutting off distorting the information that we need 
len ratingtwo Not helpful and frustrating 
len ratingthree So laggy I can t unmute in class and their are buttons I don t have like blur my background 
len ratingone As an educator I am constantly looking for innovative programs and applications that allow me and my students to strive within our current academic setting that has been hindered by the virus 
len ratingone I initially downloaded this app expecting a better way to connect with my students but I was horribly mistaken 
len ratingone Throughout the school year there was one student who failed to turn in any assignments or tests 
len ratingone He was here on an academic scholarship from North Korea and depended on the scholarship money to survive 
len ratingone I worked with him to resolve this troubling issue yet the issue persisted and by the end of the semester he had not turned in any assignments and was failing 
len ratingone This meant his scholarship was officially revoked 
len ratingone Without the scholarship he had no other choice to return to his home country of North Korea 
len ratingone When he entered North Korea he was immediately arrested as a traitor to the nation for leaving his home country to attend college in the U S To this day he is serving life in a brutal prison in North Korea 
len ratingone A couple days ago I found out the he actually turned in all the assignments Teams just didn t notify me 
len ratingone Unable to view my assignment as whenever clicks on view assignment nothing happens it stays on the same page
len ratingthree The captioning is not accurate and not useful for hearing disabled persons 
len ratingfive The teams app has allowed me to communicate with fellow employees while working remotely at any time and any place 
len ratingfive This is a fantastic app
len ratingfive This deserves to get high ratings I ve been using teams for over than months now and its fantastic 
len ratingfive I really love to make chat with my friends and make calls with my teacher 
len ratingfive I think all people in each work or school should get teams and I also think it s much better than zoom 
len ratingfive Great features and always improving 
len ratingfive I totally endorse Teams for being able to Focus my Team on necessary Tasks that must be completed 
len ratingfour Teams is the all in one solution app for enterprise texting calling and video 
len ratingfour It works great on iOS but if you don t carry your phone and rely on your watch for notifications there is no watch app 
len ratingfour This would be a star app if had an Apple Watch app 
len ratingfour Time for Microsoft to step up and provide an app for WatchOS 
len ratingone Slow as all Microsoft apps 
len ratingthree Plz add a feature to move your profile pic to the top left corner rather than bottom right 
len ratingfive I m on the move a lot do it s nice that the teams on my desktop is in sync with the app on my phone and tablet 
len ratingthree Leave my green availability longer then min
len ratingtwo So when I go to a meeting when I try to talk to my teacher sje can t hear me 
len ratingtwo Its like I am muted but I am actually not 
len ratingtwo My mute and raise hand keeps glitching 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingthree Would really like to know why no matter what I do all calls go straight to voicemail 
len ratingthree Bit of a clunky layout but it s doable 
len ratingthree Please fix the call notification function I cannot be the only one who has this issue 
len ratingfive Please update wiki for latest Microsoft team version
len ratingfive Great collaboration tool and file sharing resource helps to cut down on emails and can result In much fasted action to tasks
len ratingone UGLY U MADE ANOTHER WAY FOR SCHOOL WE COULDVE NOT DONE SCHOOL FOR A YEAR
len ratingone Really annoying how the little notification badge on the app doesn t go away when you open a message on your computer 
len ratingone It used to doesn t anymore 
len ratingone For being with the inhumane actions done by the fascist IOF and settlers 
len ratingfive This app is simple to use it has helped in various ways for us to communicate and share work 
len ratingfive It has made working from home as effective or more than being in an office
len ratingthree I love Teams 
len ratingthree But lately the app has been horrible 
len ratingthree Myself and others have been having the same problems 
len ratingthree When people call me my phone doesn t even ring 
len ratingthree As soon as they hang up I get a missed call notification 
len ratingthree Same with chats sometimes except I ll usually see the notification but as soon as I open my phone I get the notifications again all at once 
len ratingthree I deleted and redownloaded it and it worked for about hours 
len ratingthree Then I put it back on dark mode and it crashed again 
len ratingthree I don t like staring at a bright screen at night but I m gonna try to delete it again and keep it on light mode 
len ratingthree Please fix this I m not the only one with this problem 
len ratingone Hasse die app muss sie immer runterladen nur um Schule zumachen und mal herunterladen und l schen absoluter M ll wahrheit
len ratingthree It s good but need improve 
len ratingthree Hard to find and understand place 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingone  Wiki is worthless 
len ratingtwo Why is there need to do update with automatically when joininf calls camera is on 
len ratingtwo I am sure there is option to turn it off but why do the update 
len ratingfour I am impressed that teams is always making progress 
len ratingfour There are little issues I encounter like call issues and odd delays and missed redirects on push notifications but overall very good
len ratingfive It very much like texting with the Branch members and other partners
len ratingfive Very helpful app
len ratingtwo I ve been using Microsoft Teams for over a year since this is the only platform my university uses and would pay for 
len ratingtwo  it doesn t sync well with their desktop app I could never predict where the calls are going 
len ratingtwo  it always crashes on my laptop as soon as I attempt to turn on my camera or mic doesn t matter how many times I update or restart 
len ratingtwo  the iPad version is a tad more stable but I can t multitask on the same screen AND keep my camera on which is one of the iPad features 
len ratingtwo  it can be really hard to find the tab button to join a meeting even if it s scheduled 
len ratingtwo  it s even harder to find a specific recording file unless the host goes through each recording to rename 
len ratingtwo  the document editing interface isn t intuitive 
len ratingtwo  there is an iPhone version but it s difficult to turn on the speaker when I don t have earbuds with me for a call 
len ratingtwo On the other hand Zoom has been incredibly stable with an easy to use interface 
len ratingtwo Plus Teams stole the breakout room feature from Zoom 
len ratingtwo I could not in good conscience to recommend this to anybody 
len ratingone It s very boring mainly because I use it for school 
len ratingone It buffers at times and refuses to download most of the time 
len ratingone I hate this app and it needs to be better 
len ratingone A recent update under the guise of mere bug fixes and performance improvements introduced a requirement that you give the app completely access to your local network otherwise it refuses to function 
len ratingone This is utter B S 
len ratingone The app has no legitimate reason to have local network access 
len ratingone I don t know what Microsoft think they re doing but it s super creepy 
len ratingtwo  It s a really nice working hub with meetings and conversations I wish they could pin the conversations like the desktop version does 
len ratingtwo And also create a draft conversation for user itself only to drop random memos rather than opening another window 
len ratingtwo Teams have been having a lot of connection problems recently too can t open the meeting and etc 
len ratingone Ran a search of employees and it froze so I need to reset my phone
len ratingone Every time I join a meeting it takes about seconds for it to log me in 
len ratingone What s worse is that it tells everyone I joined allows me to hear everyone except I can t speak for seconds or so 
len ratingone The mute unmute button is also laggy and sometimes does not reflect reality it had the muted symbol when everyone could still hear me 
len ratingone I m pretty sure there s grounds for a lawsuit in there somewhere 
len ratingone This is the worst of any collaboration apps 
len ratingone If the companies I was working with weren t requiring Teams I would dump it in a heartbeat 
len ratingthree It searches fine but cannot open to the conversation 
len ratingthree It takes you to the end ie the most recent message
len ratingfour Too much ways of working set up 
len ratingfour I want to work they way I work best 
len ratingfour Otherwise not bad
len ratingtwo When a Teams call is active you can t open many other apps I couldn t open the camera as well as others 
len ratingtwo If the app is open without being on a call it s fine 
len ratingfive I had this app for online school and honestly it s really good it doesn t glitch like zoom
len ratingfive I love this app with the exception it consumes way much more power than zoom 
len ratingone SO I GAVE PE CLASS EVERY OTHER DAY AN I HAVE TO TIRN IN MY CAMERA AND THE APP IS SO GLITCHY THAY I CANT HEAR WHAT THE TEACHER IS SAYING AND WGEN HE SAYS TURN YOU CAMERAS ON I CANT HEAR HIM I DONT TURN MY CAMERA ON AT ALL THEN HE CALLS MY PARENTS 
len ratingone And I get in trouble 
len ratingfive Awesome app I love itttt
len ratingfive We used this for classes because of coronavirus it helped a lot and if you missed your friends you can call them I love this app I call my friends all the time if I needed help with my homework 
len ratingone Well app whenever I try to open it and never even work
len ratingfour Teams is great 
len ratingfour The one thing I noticed was when there is an external Teams invite it does not show internal attendees you forward the invite to 
len ratingfive Really its helpful and useful
len ratingthree I want to be able to delete conversations
len ratingfive Awesome tool for productivity 
len ratingfive love this app very useful
len ratingtwo Great app we use it all the time 
len ratingtwo But using the camera from within the app results in blurry pictures every time 
len ratingtwo Even on iPhone Pro Max and taping in the view finder to focus on whatever it is the result is always blurry 
len ratingtwo I can t be taking a picture of everything I need to send through the app so getting reliable pictures taken in the app is important to us 
len ratingtwo It s sad this is such a mess 
len ratingtwo I recall it working better on older iPhones 
len ratingtwo Maybe this needs to be updated for the latest iPhone cameras 
len ratingone The end
len ratingfour Collaboration Tool Needs better video conferencing
len ratingone I prefer google 
len ratingone I don t like teams sometimes the meeting don t work 
len ratingone When it updates the whole thing shuts down 
len ratingone This app is always Down 
len ratingone Don t download it 
len ratingfour Alternate color themes would be nice
len ratingfive I was a Slack user for several years and it was a good program however the all inclusiveness of Team on the Video Calendar chatting file sharing etc makes it light years ahead of the patchwork of other programs integrating to accomplish tasks 
len ratingfive My productivity is a lot higher now 
len ratingfive This app is very easy to use and I can keep in touch with all my team
len ratingfour The app works great on both my laptop and mobile device 
len ratingfour No complaints here 
len ratingfive I give this a star because it is so good it work really good I know y all work hard to keep this app and I m a student so I use this like every day
len ratingfive I love how my teams messages transfer flawlessly from my laptop to my phone 
len ratingfive There is no loosing them and that is very helpful 
len ratingfour  Love most things about this app 
len ratingfour It addresses a lot of file sharing problems including the ability to have several editors in an Excel sheet at once 
len ratingfour The meetings feature is still inferior to Zoom to me 
len ratingfour For example the mute shortcut is keys instead of space bar like Zoom 
len ratingfour Otherwise excellent platform 
len ratingone  It almost feels that every feature of this app is designed in a way to make life more difficult for users not simplify it 
len ratingone I think Microsoft needs to hire a proper UX Engineer to smoothen the User Experience
len ratingfour I really need my phone to get it but it can t
len ratingfour It s annoying that I can t see anything in my schedule a week from now 
len ratingfour Please change that
len ratingfive That s all
len ratingfive When I am not at my desk I can still use the App from my phone this is the best device ever 
len ratingfour The app runs smoothly but it says I have a voicemail and I can t delete it because an error pops up 
len ratingfour However the app syncs with my computer well 
len ratingfive Except when sharing a doc for a video call
len ratingthree  I want to like this app but the notifications do not show as they are supposed to and do not clear unless you open the app 
len ratingthree Also Teams decides when you are away and what it means to be away so it is frequently setting me to away because I am active in a non MS app
len ratingfive I don t miss a thing 
len ratingfive Able to communicate with staff with no issue
len ratingthree Sound notifications stopped working all of a sudden
len ratingfive Microsoft please add quick tutorials in Teams that work with Azure Dev Ops 
len ratingfive I m trying to learn very quickly no time to search internet for free classes by MS
len ratingtwo The audio volume is too low during classes on the iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo It starts out normal then gets so low that you cannot hear anything 
len ratingone OK so I wanna take with my friends but your stupid app wont let me OK 
len ratingthree Because I don t want to go to school virtual or in the building who agrees with me
len ratingone Microsoft generally has good UX designers so I am baffled how this ever got past any reviews 
len ratingone Even giving feedback has been buried behind clicks that I just gave up on this 
len ratingone Pinned chats dont carryover from desktop to mobile 
len ratingone You can t reply in desktop but you can in mobile 
len ratingone There are no chats in teams just weird channels that feel like forums 
len ratingone There is wasted real estate everywhere and you can t customize the chats to be concise and smaller font to get more text shown in the screen 
len ratingone In overall as communication product this is almost worse than Skype which is remarkable 
len ratingone My mic will not work even when i have it on and no one could hear me in the meeting but everything else works 
len ratingone My mic just stopped working suddenly and i can not fix it 
len ratingone It took so long to order and I needed to get in a meeting 
len ratingone Avoid at all costs 
len ratingone Will heat your device to dangerous temps 
len ratingone Slow 
len ratingone Glitchy 
len ratingone Requires unnecessary permissions 
len ratingfour I liked Skype but have since switched over 
len ratingfour I do miss knowing how long someone has been offline which teams does not have 
len ratingone I hare school
len ratingfive Awesome great for the team thank you Ingram micro
len ratingone Teams is a very difficult app to like 
len ratingone I had to use it for school and my teachers were always having problems 
len ratingone It is not equipped to handle so many people on it 
len ratingone I can t wait to be done with the school year so i don t have to use this app 
len ratingone  Bad App
len ratingone Removed the app now that Microsoft IT is monitoring all employee personal devices 
len ratingone Microsoft DSRE makes this app a useless dealbreaker 
len ratingthree It would be great to know the number of members already in a call before joining
len ratingthree Who approved pictures at bottom 
len ratingthree Seriously 
len ratingthree Apple had nothing to worry about 
len ratingthree Call me if you need help with intuitivity 
len ratingfive I am still learning but I downloaded it on my phone which is wonderful that way I can t miss anything that s important 
len ratingfive Great tool to have 
len ratingfour Teams iOS app is pretty solid 
len ratingfour Occasionally the windows version is janky but overall my experience has been positive 
len ratingfive My Company switched from Skype for Business to Teams late last month April and I love it so much 
len ratingfive Skype was always very buggy 
len ratingfive Our customers hated using it 
len ratingfive We hated using it 
len ratingfive We haven t even started using the Teams tab yet 
len ratingfive Just for chatting conference calls and screen share alone it is so much better than Skype for Business 
len ratingfive The mobile app works with my work PC seamlessly 
len ratingfive I can t wait to keep unlocking more potential out of this app 
len ratingfour Having the app on the PC and on my phone is very convenient and saved me from missing several meeting 
len ratingfour The functionally is solid and responsive 
len ratingfour Maneuvering through folder structures doesn t as you expect it and is a bit annoying when you hit the back arrow in files and it takes you somewhere completely different 
len ratingone I don t like teams on phone because when you cover your camera your phone go blank my camera is broken no I can t do anything be it s just black so I give this a star rating 
len ratingfive Previously only my email app gave me the same access as the desktop versions 
len ratingfive My company had a few other apps but the mobile version always lagged behind 
len ratingfive Teams gives me the same access as the desktop versions allowing me to be productive away from my laptops 
len ratingone bad app no lie
len ratingfive Great and reliable tool
len ratingone I cant get in this app some time it s very annoying
len ratingfive The way how its use is excellent when the text hit I know for sure it s work or personal Great job creators 
len ratingfour  Wi Fi 
len ratingone Is boring 
len ratingthree You can be in a meeting in landscape mode but the chat and participant list are only in portrait mode 
len ratingthree If you switch to another app and then tap a chat notification there s no way to get back to the meeting from the chat 
len ratingone  I m having trouble hosting a Teams meeting with the camera enabled while having another app open at the side with Split Screen 
len ratingone This causes my camera feed to pause I can still see the video of others but mine freezes 
len ratingone It s really annoying as my iPad is the only device I take my classes on and i would like to see myself on one side while taking class notes on the other as it should be 
len ratingone Hope you fix this soon 
len ratingthree Windows Becomes very slow with Teams and when it is with GB RAM
len ratingone Teams has no functionality that needs access to my local network 
len ratingone Preventing joining calls until I allow access was a terrible decision for an otherwise fine app 
len ratingone I ll update my one star review if they fix this 
len ratingone The newest update requires users to allow access to the local network 
len ratingone This is an invasion of privacy and make the call function useless to me 
len ratingone  Microsoft continuously asks me to validate my account says it sends a code to validate and code NEVER shows up 
len ratingone Days of trying both from browser and app nothing 
len ratingone I m done 
len ratingfive Its pretty cool how they fit everything from the pc version in the phone app 
len ratingfive I use it all the time so convenient to have access to so much without even having to open my laptop 
len ratingfive Amazing app never crashes or has problems
len ratingone Chats can t be deleted 
len ratingone Being permanently stuck with messages isn t a very good feature 
len ratingfive Not generally a huge fan of Microsoft products but this is one of the best tools I ve ever used 
len ratingone I hate it
len ratingfive Awesome for Meetings 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfour  Gracias por esta magn fica aplicaci n 
len ratingfour Por favor consideren incorporar en futuras actualizaciones de esta app la opci n de que el Organizador de una reuni n pueda desactivar la opci n de los asistentes de activar su c mara 
len ratingfour De esta manera el organizador no solo tendria el control de quien puede hablar medianamente la opci n que ya esta de desactivar los micr fonos sino que tambi n pudiera controlar quien puede activar su c mara 
len ratingfour Deseo que tomen en cuenta esta sugerencia Salud para ustedes 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Only thing that I wish it had is if we were able to edit other team members entries 
len ratingfive At this point we can t but still a very good app for multiple people to use 
len ratingone Teams is sooo slow and annoying it often glitches and never works 
len ratingone Plus it does not do automatic updates so you have to do it yourself if you do not update it will go very slow even slower than Normal 
len ratingone Why can t I have more than one account with the same phone number 
len ratingone It makes no sense 
len ratingone Nothing is being protected 
len ratingone It s all the same info 
len ratingone I don t have access to a former employers account and can not make a new one until I get a new phone number 
len ratingfour I was not a fan of Teams when I started using it for teaching last year but it has definitely improved through time 
len ratingfour The most recent update is not great however 
len ratingfour I can t see large gallery when I share my screen 
len ratingfour As a second grade teacher I would find it helpful to make large gallery automatic and visible at all times as well as including the boxes for all participants in the meeting include in large gallery even if their cameras are off 
len ratingfour It gives you a better idea of who s present instantly especially when teaching a group of or so students 
len ratingfour It also makes it more seamless to encourage students with cameras off to turn them on if possible 
len ratingone In the version update Teams now requires you to provide access to your local network devices or else it kneecaps functionality and will not let you join meetings 
len ratingone Guess I m dialing in until they fix this 
len ratingone Teams is absolutely terrible for hosting conference calls or web conferences with outside vendors 
len ratingone Weather I am calling into a meeting hosted by another company or people from other companies are calling into my meeting it s always a mess 
len ratingone The visiting party almost always gets thrown into a confusing chaos of redirected and faulty links 
len ratingone Connecting to a simple conference call often takes minutes if you are lucky enough to get trough at all 
len ratingone We often have to exchange cell phone numbers by email as a work around 
len ratingone If your looking for a good way to loose clients and alienate key vendors MS Teams is excellent for that 
len ratingfive I enjoy working with Teams 
len ratingfive As we work remotely I m able to stay in constant contact with my sales team 
len ratingfive Video and sound quality are both fantastic 
len ratingtwo The app worked well enough till last week 
len ratingtwo After updating to Teams won t allow calls until I allow access to other devices on my network 
len ratingtwo This is invasive and NOT necessary 
len ratingtwo Legit apps should not hold unrelated functionality hostage by requiring invasive permissions 
len ratingtwo I am very disappointed 
len ratingtwo Will not be using the app until they correct this 
len ratingtwo Maybe Teams can be trusted but training users to submit to unsafe permissions Maybe I m overreacting 
len ratingtwo Submitted bug report and this message 
len ratingtwo Not sure if there a better way to contact this developer 
len ratingone  It kicks me out all the time and it crashes all the time 
len ratingfive This app is the best app I ve ever used in the Military
len ratingfive All
len ratingone I got this for school and it was fine for like a week but then it started to act up and would not get my assignments right and was very slow also it would always glitch
len ratingthree After minutes my iPhone got really super hot 
len ratingthree App ended up crashing 
len ratingthree Phone still very warm 
len ratingfour I can barely hear the audio alert when someone sends me a message on Teams 
len ratingfour When I select a different alert the sample sound is very audible 
len ratingfour I have tried changing the settings with no luck 
len ratingfour Since I couldn t find a place to make a report on this I am posting it here 
len ratingfour iPad th Generation Version I just updated the Teams app this morning 
len ratingfour It s the latest 
len ratingfour Ehh it s alright
len ratingfive This app is great it helps me with school when I don t have my laptop
len ratingone The most recent update wants to scan my local network to connect to a call 
len ratingone This is entirely unnecessary an invasion of my privacy and wasn t required yesterday 
len ratingtwo The app is mandated by my organization making me a captive user Microsoft s favorite kind 
len ratingtwo The app has issues synchronizing calendar it remains unaware of new meetings 
len ratingtwo Often I have to switch to Outlook find the meeting there and click on it then Teams opens the meeting 
len ratingtwo The sound quality is so so degrading rapidly on imperfect connections Webex is much better 
len ratingtwo The worst just happened after the recent upgrade the app insists on gaining access to my local network 
len ratingtwo It wouldn t connect to any meetings unless I allow which I will not because I don t want it to fish around here 
len ratingtwo I m using the call me feature for now to avoid that requirement and finding sound quality to be better too 
len ratingone The newest version demands to find other devices spy on the network 
len ratingone Basic features that worked yesterday on longer work saying this needs to be enabled 
len ratingone This permission is not listed in the data tracking health label 
len ratingone To work around disable wifi join call disable network spying reenable wifi 
len ratingthree Need a full screen mode when sharing screens 
len ratingfour I think integration of files share point into the messaging app has made things confusing 
len ratingfour I understand the concept of having location to do all the things but I think you ve started to make a camel 
len ratingone Thanks to this app I am now in a mental state where I just want to give up on school 
len ratingone  The latest version requires ability to connect to devices on your local network to join meetings 
len ratingone Joining meetings shouldn t require connecting to the local devices on your network and indeed this capability worked fine up until around v 
len ratingfour It is a solid app but it is glitchy sometimes when you try to do other things on your phone 
len ratingfour  Teams for Education When I wanted to update the attachment of an assignment that I had turned in before the set due date I had to undo my turn in to do that and I ended up getting turned in late status 
len ratingfour Please add a feature where you can update files attached to an assignment without having to resubmit 
len ratingfour The teacher can also be notified of such an update but not receive a late status 
len ratingfour Also a rare bug happens when I exit the Assignments interface after openining it from the Teams section not directly from the Assignments drawer sometimes I am unable to see my other teams but only the current team I also cannot open the menu for my other teams 
len ratingfour This bug doesn t always happen 
len ratingfour Thanks for your understanding 
len ratingtwo When I get a Teams audio call on my Mac my iPad will also ring with a full screen notification that a call is incoming 
len ratingtwo The problem is that the full screen Teams notification never goes away on the iPad if I answer the call on my Mac and it will heat up the iPad and burn through the entire battery in a few hours 
len ratingtwo If my iPad is in my bag it gets very hot and could potentially caused damage 
len ratingtwo This never used to happen so the bug has been recently introduced 
len ratingtwo PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP 
len ratingtwo Otherwise the Teams app is great 
len ratingtwo Five stars 
len ratingtwo But this bug means I can t have it on my iPad at all 
len ratingtwo When this is fixed I will gladly re review 
len ratingfive This is the best App 
len ratingfive The video and sound has never had an issue 
len ratingfive The resolution is fantastic 
len ratingfive This is so much better than Skype 
len ratingfive You can also send big files to groups with no issues 
len ratingone  this is by far the worst collaboration app service I ever used 
len ratingone Not sure why some people ar hypnotized by Microsoft products but very disappointed that they couldn t build a single service which actually works without any issues
len ratingfive No seriously teams is the best 
len ratingfive I even prefer it over slack 
len ratingfive Everything you need all at your fingertips with teams
len ratingtwo I know these good reviews have to be fake 
len ratingtwo Microsoft teams is really bad 
len ratingtwo It won t hang up on calls keeps ringing on multiple devices there s not annotation option bad audio I can keep going 
len ratingtwo This isn t just from me it s the consensus across a company of a couple hundreds if not thousands of people 
len ratingtwo We are stuck with it because of our corporate management not because there are better options out there 
len ratingtwo I d highly suggest another option 
len ratingfive With this app you can crush the day 
len ratingfive I m a child and ten I love teams even though people don t like school they rated google class room ones so it can get out I like teams 
len ratingfive We use Teams at work 
len ratingfive This app makes it easy for me to go to appointments or run a quick errand without missing anything 
len ratingone Teams does not need access to my local network it proved to me it didn t when everything worked fine without it 
len ratingone But now it is forcing me to give access to it 
len ratingone No Microsoft I m not letting you rip away even more of my privacy 
len ratingfour There should be an option to use multiple ways of connecting to the audio of the meeting and not just the device itself 
len ratingfour Just like webex as multiple options 
len ratingone My work has been using this a lot lately and when I get the invite with the link to an upcoming meeting it opens the app but there s nowhere to rsvp or save it to the calendar so receive no notifications and end up missing every single scheduled meeting 
len ratingone To make it worse there s nowhere in the app or on the developers site via AppStore to make a suggestion 
len ratingone This has been a total waste of time for me
len ratingone i have desktop teams and it s beyond slow 
len ratingone half the time doesn t even load the website and freezes with a blank screen 
len ratingone definitely is NOT my wifi continuous problems with this site trying to load into meetings 
len ratingone reloading page does absolutely nothing and most times i have to open the website over times just for the site to load 
len ratingone HORRIBLE SITE that i m forced to use much rather would use zoom
len ratingfour The Teams meeting screen is reliable and high resolution 
len ratingfour I would much appreciate the ability to hide or detach the participants icons camera feeds so it does not occupy space on my main screen and so I could position it close to my camera 
len ratingfour It would help to have an auto hide capability for the command bar at the top 
len ratingfive Great app for office discussions etc but please fix the ability to delete chat logs 
len ratingfive This app has been around for a while and it s been a long requested feature Regards Me
len ratingone it s all good i gave it star just because i hate school
len ratingfour Teams is a good secure platform for work collaboration and generally speaking the web meeting functonality is top notch 
len ratingfour One thing it definitely needs for iOS is voice call support in CarPlay 
len ratingfour Please add ASAP 
len ratingfive Syncs my outlook calendar allows me to schedule and take meetings away from the office and has voice features 
len ratingfive Improves my life as a remote worker
len ratingone  Microsoft continuously asks me to validate my account says it sends a code to validate and code NEVER shows up 
len ratingone Days of trying bothe from brows we and app nothing 
len ratingone I m done 
len ratingfive I really like using Teams but recently my notification tone changed to a default alert tone and I can t change it back 
len ratingfive Now I can t distinguish between various alerts 
len ratingfive Please help 
len ratingfive One of if not the best app I ve personally come across 
len ratingfive The features and easy to use interface make it extremely smartphone friendly 
len ratingone I use a personal account and business account 
len ratingone Teams app consistently gets stuck switching between accounts when simply opening app to reply to a message 
len ratingone Lack of features and privileges from desktop app 
len ratingone Example I can attached images in chat on the iPhone app but not desktop 
len ratingone Stupid 
len ratingone Microsoft support is non existent they ignore fatal errors and bugs 
len ratingone Other apps are far superior but stuck with this as companies drink the Bill Gates kooliad 
len ratingfive I loved Teams even before last year when we started working remotely 
len ratingfive My team though was not engaged wity it 
len ratingfive It was too new and they could not see the advantage of it 
len ratingfive After we closed the office and went remote it became one of the major ways our team and the others teams in the organization stayed connected and took our work and collaboration to a whole different level 
len ratingfive There s still so much more we can use it for and I will be leading the team on how we can use it and love it 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft 
len ratingfour  Teams for Education When I wanted to update the attachment of an assignment that I had turned in before the set due date I had to undo my turn in to do that and I ended up getting turned in late status 
len ratingfour Please add a feature where you can update files attached to an assignment without having to resubmit 
len ratingfour The teacher can also be notified of such an update but not receive a late status 
len ratingfour Thanks for your understanding 
len ratingfive Excellent app the only issue I have on the phone app is the ability to add pictures to messages needs worked on 
len ratingone Won t link like it says 
len ratingone Missed nieces bridal shower 
len ratingone This is why I dislike Microsoft 
len ratingone  Teams on the iPhone is Ok but it s a bloated app that continues to get bigger because there is no way to clean the caches it creates 
len ratingone The last update added a feature to devour approximately of my battery every hour to sit in the background in hopes of a message coming in that it could tell me about 
len ratingone The overall usability is sightly worse than any other app in this space most notably slack 
len ratingone But because you are likely using it because you have office for work or school you ll use it any way 
len ratingone  Hi Thank you for sharing your feedback one of our resolutions for is to trim down our size while providing even more useful functionality 
len ratingone If you can provide more specific information on how we can improve on we will defin
len ratingthree It is annoying to see number of notifications even if i read them from my laptop
len ratingone it doesnt give free robux like the app says
len ratingfive After actively using this app for over months I have yet to ask myself Why can t I do that on the mobile app while I can do it on the computer app Maybe there are differences but it appears to be full featured 
len ratingfive Job well done my Microsoft 
len ratingfive Collaborative framework that makes communicating with your team and the rest of the organization ultimately in real time and on point 
len ratingone I m getting no notifications on the app 
len ratingone I ve done all the things suggested 
len ratingone Fix it please 
len ratingone I attend a Kaiser group that uses Microsoft Team and of the time the videos don t work people freeze can t longin a total bust 
len ratingone There is no incentive to join the group with these issues each week 
len ratingfive Is reliable
len ratingone  When I log in to the app it just gives me a white screen then crashes needs more improvement for ios
len ratingtwo When I need to use the program it almost always requires me to revalidate my account 
len ratingtwo Why is facial recognition insufficient 
len ratingtwo  Completely a pain to manage using a Bluetooth headset 
len ratingtwo If it isn t connected before Teams open switching to Bluetooth is not straight forward 
len ratingfive Amazing an fast way to keep up with the class an see messages from class mates
len ratingone So boring dosent matter what the rest of the comment say delete it those are just parents no opinion fro kids whatsoever I think school is boring the make fun enough for us to learn o and the app is to complex for me to know we re everything it glitches sometimes 
len ratingthree Plz pllzzzz alphabetically mera naam upr aajata tchr bar bar mera nam leti bhai kuch esa krde ki jis sequence m meeting join ho vaise hi sbkee nam aayen vrna mein yhan pr star de ke jaunga in hinenglish As in teams attendees list is in alphabetical order my name always tops in that rather any other thing and I become a got for my techr do something that list would be in the sequence in the which attendes join english 
len ratingfive I love teams 
len ratingfive I can do almost everything on it 
len ratingfive Worth downloading and use at work
len ratingtwo I would like the away statues to go away 
len ratingtwo I hate that it shows idle after a few minutes of inactivity
len ratingthree I enjoy teams it works well most of the time but some times it will show that there is a meeting going on in a group but there is no way for you to join 
len ratingthree Anytime I m in a teams meeting without headphones my screen flashes to black and then back and sometimes adjusts the brightness of my screen on its own 
len ratingthree It makes it very difficult to do anything else while in a meeting 
len ratingthree It even disabled my ability to adjust my screen brightness everytime it goes black and then kicks me out of the menu 
len ratingone  This app being for work and not a social network is beyond frustrating to use due to inaccurate status messages at best and causing some to lose their jobs at worst 
len ratingone It is not at all reliable for work teams to know if a co worker or manager can talk or is actively at their computer 
len ratingone It lies about its users status constantly saying fpeoplw are away or are unavailable on both desktop or on mobile versions after restarts and log outs and all the fixes from Microsoft in the online forums 
len ratingone Nothing makes it work right 
len ratingone It should not show users as away out off office or as unavailable unless they really are 
len ratingone The user is often actively using their keyboard is available and has physically tried to tell the Teams app that by changing their inaccurate status to available but the Teams will not allow them to 
len ratingone An appointment in an outlook calendar be it from five months ago or from two hours ago should not dictate a status message that is uncontrollable by the user 
len ratingone And even when a meeting or appointment is erased from their outlook calendar teams will not reset user status to available 
len ratingone If it eventually resets it takes hours to do so 
len ratingone  I updated teams before writing this review today April after many months of frustration with status messages on desktop work computers hoping Microsoft had fixed this issue 
len ratingone This has been a huge work delaying issue for our workgroups and for managers 
len ratingone But no teams still has the same horrible glitches as it did many months ago issues that are no doubt costing some their jobs if bosses believe Microsoft knows what they are doing with the Teams app status messages 
len ratingone This app wastes so much time for so many as users try to google fixes to the status setting issues IT teams get useless responses in Microsoft forums and coworkers mangers think people are not available or away when they actually are at work 
len ratingone Do NOT trust this app for accurate status messages 
len ratingfive TEAMS is LEGIT 
len ratingfive Perfect for any size company or industry 
len ratingfive Get things done with Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive Amen 
len ratingone Does not work with AirPods Microsoft s beef with apple is screwing over their customers 
len ratingone Infuriating 
len ratingthree The Microsoft Teams app runs pretty smoothly on the newer iPads based solely on my experience 
len ratingthree However as someone who uses Teams for school I NEED to use multitasking if Zoom supports camera support while multitasking why can t Microsoft Teams 
len ratingthree It s frustrating not being able to have my camera on while making a simple note 
len ratingthree You can t even do Slide Over without the camera being shut off 
len ratingthree It s really disappointing from a company like Microsoft 
len ratingthree This transcends education for sure as I know this is a simple feature that would be needed to all fields of work as well 
len ratingone The latest version of the app no longer realizes when you re active in teams on the desktop and just spams notifications 
len ratingone Yes I have the settings set up to block all notifications when active in desktop app 
len ratingone You can be presenting in a meeting and your phone will still blow up anytime anyone pings anything in the presentation chat 
len ratingone The only option is to turn off notifications completely 
len ratingone Overheats the phone to the point it shuts down 
len ratingone Only way to use it is turning off incoming video and outgoing camera feed ultimately defeating the purpose of the collaboration app 
len ratingone I will say it works nicely before it shuts down 
len ratingfive Super easy to communicate with my coworkers when we can t access our email immediately love it
len ratingone I ve signed in several times The account doesn t open And they keep telling me to sign in You guys should do something about it An hour of meeting just gone
len ratingtwo My biggest complaint is that you can t include attachments when sending meeting invites 
len ratingtwo This is terrible because ALL of our meetings require documents or files attached 
len ratingtwo So you have to send the initial invite and then go back to your calendar and then add the attachments and then resend the invite 
len ratingtwo Waste of time and inconvenient to everyone when invite is sent twice
len ratingfive This app lets me do my work online without any problems and it has good camera quality
len ratingthree  Between my desk and my phone your system keeps changing me to away if I am in a non MS app 
len ratingthree Fix this and allow user to control their away timeouts 
len ratingone I missed like of my classes because the video quality is so bad
len ratingone This app takes your battery from to in a couple hours 
len ratingone Haven t used it in months background updates disabled doesn t matter 
len ratingone Any teams call on any device immediately drains the battery on iPads 
len ratingone MS has been aware of the issues for well over a year 
len ratingone Almost like MS did this on purpose to promote the surface pro 
len ratingone Uninstall it right away 
len ratingfive Once adapting on the fly I found this software very useful 
len ratingfour We mainly use the Teams Chat MS ecosystem 
len ratingfour Teams has too many features and too hard to figure out 
len ratingfour It also allows doing the same thing multiple ways but each is called a different function 
len ratingfour Planner is a different way of using the To Do as an example same with Chat and Group 
len ratingthree Messaging is fast and fluent 
len ratingthree The mentions and call forwarding is great 
len ratingthree What I want to see is easier way to have a group of contact without making a team and not as simple as making a chat 
len ratingthree Making team is lock by my organization 
len ratingthree So my department has to use multiple chats for communication 
len ratingthree Having something in the middle would be great 
len ratingone i don t like school
len ratingone Not happy with the new update I believe we should be able to message other students to ask and say things to them i dont even know why you decided to do that 
len ratingone I also have many troubles changing my profile picture and this app is very laggy and does not open sometimes Not happy with the update 
len ratingone I believe we should be able to message other students to ask and say things to them i dont even know why you decided to do that 
len ratingone I also have many troubles changing my profile picture and this app is very laggy and does not open sometimes 
len ratingfive Really nice interface and integration 
len ratingfour Good but need to be able to open multiple windows tabs as well be able to have more control with formatting and options in crafting meetings 
len ratingfour Saving and coming back to it etc 
len ratingfive Does not time out 
len ratingone No longer receiving chat notifications on mobile iOS the option to send all notifications whether on or away from desktop was removed with update 
len ratingone Aaa
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone App has been extremely buggy 
len ratingone Despite connecting on my AirPods in Bluetooth no audio played it works on phone and speaker but nothing when I select AirPods 
len ratingone Then proceeded to get disconnected from the call when I put away my AirPods 
len ratingone Incredibly frustrating 
len ratingone I use Microsoft Teams every day of the week for class and it always has some sort of issue like not syncing properly low connection even tho I am right next to my router and just right now April at PR 
len ratingone My teams went into a pure white screen that I can t interact with 
len ratingone It is absolutely buggy and just got awful to work with 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It great for online classes and communication 
len ratingfive I have one suggestion during meetings I think the backgrounds with pictures from your gallery thing should let us make at least have 
len ratingfive It only allows though 
len ratingfive Thank you for taking the time to read my review 
len ratingtwo This app is so boring I mean for school or work idk
len ratingtwo im using it for movie night so two stars but i have to use it for school so 
len ratingone Closes randomly white screen and then closes 
len ratingone Honestly worst program ever for an iPad I have nothing good to say about it 
len ratingone It s bad cause I can t kick my teacher out of class They should put that button
len ratingfour I love Microsoft teams on mobile 
len ratingfour But I have one issue it doesn t let me select background for video 
len ratingfour The only thing I can select is blur 
len ratingfour I am using iPhone 
len ratingfour Is this feature deployed or in process 
len ratingone Microsoft teams needs so much work me and my siblings use teams and we have found a ton of bug s
len ratingfive Very helpful for staying in touch in a pinch 
len ratingfive Nice work Microsoft 
len ratingone The latest update identifies support of backgrounds you know like others have had for a long time 
len ratingone Hooray 
len ratingone Except it doesn t There is no means of setting your background 
len ratingone Bummer 
len ratingfive I am on an iPad and everyone in the meeting can apply a background effect only me I cannot apply a background effect can you make on iPad can apply background effect please make it because I need the background effect on iPad and I don t have an computer
len ratingone So I use Microsoft Teams for school but it keeps saying that my wifi is weak even though it isn t 
len ratingone Then it just kicks me out for no reason 
len ratingone Then there s a popup that says Are you still there 
len ratingone When I clicked it it refreshes the page 
len ratingone I seriously think that Teams needs a work 
len ratingone I watched the commercial for this app a few minutes ago and it gave me ptsd as a student 
len ratingone It reminds me of the many meetings that I m barely even awake for 
len ratingone I m closing this app is annoying triggering and a tremendous problem in today s society 
len ratingone It won t let me sign in please help 
len ratingone Need this for work 
len ratingfive love using this for school it s just amazing lt 
len ratingtwo Put the assignments tab back it doesn t show how many assignments I have in class 
len ratingfive Microsoft teams is part of my daily work life 
len ratingfive I like it in general and I like it even more because it keeps coming with new features every now and then 
len ratingfive Shows that the dev team is trying to keep getting better 
len ratingtwo It will not let me sign in I already have a Skype account it keeps telling me my number is already in use which i already know 
len ratingtwo I have had to reset my password everything
len ratingfive I use this for school and it s really good 
len ratingfive It s kinda laggy but I can deal with it 
len ratingfive I would prefer using this if you are doing online school you can chat to your friends and teacher and do assignments and go to meetings 
len ratingfive You can even call your friend after school 
len ratingfive It s really great 
len ratingone  Teams on the iPhone is Ok but it s a bloated app that continues to get bigger because there is no way to clean the caches it creates 
len ratingone The overall usability is sightly worse than any other app in this space most notably slack 
len ratingone But because you are likely using it because you have office for work or school you ll use it any way 
len ratingone  Hi Thank you for sharing your feedback one of our resolutions for is to trim down our size while providing even more useful functionality 
len ratingone If you can provide more specific information on how we can improve on we will defin
len ratingfour To start teams is a great app but I am elementary student and and I m online school so a realy on teams to be my education site but I have missed weeks of school because it has loged out of my acount and is not letting log back in Teams if you could help with this issue I would love you to help me 
len ratingtwo I just want consistency with this app 
len ratingfive Our corporate team has adopted teams as well as Microsoft 
len ratingfive They work well together snd has seen constant improvements 
len ratingthree This is a recent issue but one that s persistent even after updates 
len ratingthree It s been a pretty great app otherwise until lately 
len ratingthree But as a project manager it s certainly problematic for me 
len ratingone I hope the company I work for doesn t get access to erase my phone 
len ratingfive Without Teams companies would have suffered more under the pandemic period 
len ratingfive But I sometimes hate it because it has removed the line between work and personal life 
len ratingfive I m old school and I like to pick up the phone and speak with an underwriter and processor or a colleague 
len ratingfive However in today s world it s getting very difficult to do 
len ratingfive This is the next best thing for someone that doesn t really like change 
len ratingfive I have adapted well and it has become a vital tool in my day to day production 
len ratingone Makes it impossible to use my PIN now
len ratingfour Very effective and efficient work app 
len ratingfour Still somewhat cumbersome navigating and using 
len ratingfour Need more practice to be fluid and utilize to the fullest potential 
len ratingfour so some things go wrong and then i have a class the teacher said that i have not been doing my homework and it completely confusing but aside from everything else I have to say it s pretty good 
len ratingone Ar michvenebs mandaturis zars 
len ratingone  Wiki is worthless without search 
len ratingone Notifications don t always work 
len ratingone Wiki code snippets in dark mode are unreadable 
len ratingone The mobile app s camera can be so easily turned on accidentally which caused some privacy issues 
len ratingfive Easy and quick love it
len ratingone Following apple app store policies apps may not request a rating more than twice a year 
len ratingone Teams uses a fake are you enjoying this app to then ask for a rating 
len ratingone This allows them to prompt you more than the two times using this alternate prompt that filters out people with negative reviews 
len ratingfive Jk I love how simple it is to use and students could use it easier and it help the education for kids 
len ratingtwo super crappy and laggy 
len ratingtwo really hard to hold meetings
len ratingthree  Our company adopted Teams at least months ago 
len ratingthree Our primary reason at the time was for web conferences 
len ratingthree Everything was great for a long time 
len ratingthree However recently the iPhone Bluetooth audio has become VERY erratic for no obvious reason 
len ratingthree Some meetings will be fine while others are awful 
len ratingthree My computer sitting in the same office on the same WiFi has none of these issues 
len ratingthree So far the complaint responses have been we re sorry 
len ratingthree Getting to be very frustrating 
len ratingtwo On PC it was ok before the update but now it shows who is in the meeting a lot bigger and tbh I really don t care who is in my class I just want to be able to pin my teacher so I can focus on her and not have other people and names covering of my screen thank you very much
len ratingfive Allows full work away from computer I ve joined meetings while on transit and the video was of teammates sharing screens were crystal clear 
len ratingfive The sound was clear as well 
len ratingfive I also am able to chat easily 
len ratingtwo The microphone is my least favorite things about teams Whenever Your taking class the microphone turns on at random moments when your not even clicking the microphone You could say something personal and everyone in the room with you would know Please fix the microphone Thank you 
len ratingfive This is the app that many of us have been wanting for a long time 
len ratingfive Simple to use from a calling chatting meeting standpoint 
len ratingfive With a little bit of training and usage you can do so much more than that 
len ratingone Mic keeps getting triggered and it causes it to lag on iPhone 
len ratingone rate it badly so it gets taken of the app store 
len ratingtwo To start Microsoft is awesome and all their apps work great on pc 
len ratingtwo I assume this is only because I m on an iOS device 
len ratingtwo No other apps do this 
len ratingtwo I am constantly having the app crash and affects my outlook app as well 
len ratingtwo Constantly having to log in but it just redirects me to log in again after I put in my credentials to log in 
len ratingtwo It locks my phone up to where I have to force restart to get back to Home Screen 
len ratingtwo All around a hassle 
len ratingtwo If I didn t have to use it for work I would just delete 
len ratingone I don t like how the role Off the chat and background for my students I would create project were the would have to change there backgrounds well I can t anymore thanks teams 
len ratingone I have so much trouble with this 
len ratingone It s hard to navigate and logged me off at least times a day 
len ratingone Such a bad app
len ratingfive Very useful for my job 
len ratingfive We coworkers got group chat with our bosses for any concerns 
len ratingfive And we get our assignment from microsoft teams as well 
len ratingfour The app is perfect but the only problem is that when my teacher share their screen and use PowerPoint sometimes they have videos and the videos doesn t work on iPad iPhone it only works for laptops so can you see if you can fix this problem 
len ratingfour And thank you for this amazing app 
len ratingfive I m not sure whyI waited so long to download the Teams mobile app but I m sure glad I did 
len ratingfive I like it more than I like the desktop app 
len ratingfive You have the ability to take pictures with your phone which can then be sent to your teammates 
len ratingfive I also find that I frequently receive messages on the mobile app before they come through on my computer 
len ratingfive Love Teams especially the mobile app 
len ratingtwo Great app except it can t cope with multiple organizations or setups 
len ratingtwo This reduces viability 
len ratingtwo We work with construction companies on multiple projects 
len ratingtwo Teams can t currently cope with these multiple environments 
len ratingone  Don t force me to use Edge browser 
len ratingone Do support CarPlay 
len ratingone It said teams for your personal life is not available for desktop yet 
len ratingone It didn t work in mobile either 
len ratingone This is the worst app ever
len ratingone This is the worst app
len ratingone Calls always come through 
len ratingone No matter what 
len ratingone I turn the notifications off through the app and my phone settings and they still come through 
len ratingone Very draining on my battery 
len ratingfive Best thing ever for our work I love it 
len ratingfive Teams meeting cameras combined with our overhead sketch camera and screen sharing capabilities helped us thrive through this pandemic 
len ratingfive While nothing will take the place of real human interaction and in person collaborations it has been an excellent tool through this time that we will continue to use to help grow and expedite our services 
len ratingfive MB
len ratingfour So when I join a meeting it s completely fine but then after like minutes it starts to pause to often and it tells me to turn off my camera but normally it doesn t change anything 
len ratingfive Waiting for OUTLOOK and ONENOTE connectors 
len ratingthree  The app is great but missing a key feature that is standard automatically change the color scheme based on phone settings 
len ratingthree This is on the Outlook App and should be on here too 
len ratingthree Will update once this is added 
len ratingfour Is it just me or sometimes half my taskbar disappears and I can t find my assignments otherwise MS Teams works very well 
len ratingone Like i have to weak up every morning for study like i just want to sleep the app is so much ugly 
len ratingone  Had Microsoft s authenticator app keep getting triggered when it should ve known I can t use it for whatever reason with it s errors 
len ratingone Had to uninstall it to be able to login to my work account 
len ratingone Garbage 
len ratingone It tacs so longh to get in clas an is so bad too bicas i jave too do scool
len ratingfive It s proven to be handy to have the Teams App readily available when running late or have connectivity issues from home 
len ratingfive I m able to get to the team with easy access and send updates right away 
len ratingfive It has saved me stress and gained me respect among my peers 
len ratingfive Alex
len ratingfive One is if ur on iPad like me u should while in meeting allow to pin more people and also one more this I love this app so much the sad this is I can t change my picture for my account and we ll I can it s that it won t
len ratingfive It s an excellent way to keep in touch with my teammates at work I have thoroughly enjoyed utilizing this tool
len ratingone i absolutely hate it 
len ratingone I noticed my call history showed I made calls to the Teams meeting line 
len ratingone I never chose this option I can t find any way to turn it off there s no warning that attending a meeting for work could cost you money on your personal cell plan 
len ratingone Also everyone on the call complains about an echo and choppy sound whenever I unmute 
len ratingone Never had these problems with BlueJeans or Zoom or Skype 
len ratingone It will not let me in
len ratingthree Can they make this app able to sync a shift to the iphone apple device calendar 
len ratingone Even when channels are silenced we get notifications 
len ratingone Can you test your app sometimes 
len ratingfive Works well use it daily 
len ratingtwo Seriously 
len ratingtwo I hate the breakout room update get RID OF IT SERIOUSLY 
len ratingtwo Swiping a chat message or any notification from lock screen causes switching infinite loop requiring restart every time 
len ratingtwo Can t open any notifications without this problem 
len ratingtwo I have latest iOS for iPhone and latest version of Microsoft teams 
len ratingtwo Also it would be nice if you would add the notification tone from the PC version instead of the standard Apple notification tone so I know right away I m getting a notification from teams
len ratingfive can t live work without it 
len ratingfive keeps getting better and better
len ratingthree I really like the Teams video conferencing it s really the smoothest and least freezing option 
len ratingthree However the features are constantly lagging behind others 
len ratingthree It took forever to allow more than people at a time when others allowed many 
len ratingthree When on a laptop signed in as a guest a user cannot be pinned 
len ratingthree And with the iOS app I can t believe there is still no background feature 
len ratingthree It is often a requirement for privacy concerns blur is available but does not hide enough to satisfy privacy needs though it should be an easy extension from blur to background 
len ratingthree Not having the background feature limits the use ability of Teams 
len ratingthree Please keep up and make available the features that are causing many users to use other platforms when we would rather use Teams 
len ratingthree During meetings and stuff it works well but it logs you out every couple hours and you have to log back in 
len ratingthree It s annoying 
len ratingthree And it sends you fake notifications during the weekend it s very annoying and you guys should STOP that
len ratingfive Easy convenient useful no surprise that Microsoft rolls out a new product and it s great
len ratingfive excellent for team building 
len ratingone  yes
len ratingthree You can only see one week ahead on the calendar not even the full week ahead 
len ratingthree For example if it s the end of the day Wednesday and you want to see next Wednesday you re out of luck it shows days total at all times 
len ratingthree This is a massive barrier to this apps effectiveness 
len ratingthree Most people have to plan further out and while you could use outlook to see further ahead I can t think of any good reason to not allow that capability within the app itself 
len ratingthree I have teams for work on my personal phone but I don t want to have to add outlook too so I have to open my work computer to view my schedule 
len ratingfive With the use of this app 
len ratingfive Our company has been able to reduce G amp A cost and allow all the humans to stay in contact with each other 
len ratingfive Could use a few cooler emojis the hamburgler would be a cool one robble robble 
len ratingfour This is a wonderful app to communicate with coworkers and supervisors Sometimes in a sales position you feel all alone because you have to work independently This is a great way for employees and supervisors to communicate ask questions with quick answers Keep each other informed on the same page and post achievements 
len ratingfour I m not getting reminders for meetings 
len ratingtwo Baddddd
len ratingone It has a small pp
len ratingthree Is very frustrating not being able to just natively use my AirPods Pro Max as the speakers and microphone 
len ratingthree I can t understand why it s so hard to add an airplay button
len ratingone You must give mic access to join meeting 
len ratingone Mic access is also always on when you join even if you re muted 
len ratingone So it s probably recording everything anyway 
len ratingthree Fix it so if someone kicks someone in a meeting it will tell you their name because we dont know WHO IS KICKING PEOPLE
len ratingfive The biggest gap to other similar tools we use is that we can t pause what we are sharing on screen and have to stop instead 
len ratingfive Kind of clunky in my opinion 
len ratingfive  Most intuitive highly functional reliable scalable communication platform 
len ratingtwo Been in a lot of meetings but this chat is so difficult to access
len ratingone Not getting in iWatch
len ratingfive Great way to stay connected
len ratingfour It s really good but I want to get the app back but it won t load at all
len ratingtwo  of the time I try to transfer a call it says transfer failed doesn t matter if I consult or blind transfer or what status the other person is on 
len ratingtwo Also you can t transfer a call straight to someone s voicemail 
len ratingtwo IM function works well and is useful 
len ratingtwo Can you please fix the call transfers on the app 
len ratingtwo And PLEASE let me send calls to voicemail 
len ratingone This app is decent 
len ratingone That s the only way I can describe it 
len ratingone There s SO MANY bugs it s a huge swarm 
len ratingone Almost every time I join a meeting I get stuck in the waiting room except I can hear everything 
len ratingone It s so annoying 
len ratingone The meetings are laggy the chats get glitched when you use two devices sometimes the posts don t go through you get my point 
len ratingone This app is very very very frustrating 
len ratingone I ve asked other people and they have the same problems as myself 
len ratingone If there were much less bugs this app would get a better rating 
len ratingone Unfortunately that s not the case and this deserves one star 
len ratingone And I m sure they have the tools to fix it but they just don t want to so people get the one where you have to pay money 
len ratingone I m sure that one s just fine 
len ratingone So yes I do not like Teams I m sick of it 
len ratingfour I have a little bit problem I am using this app on ipad pro amp my iPhone So actually there is a small problem which when switch on the camera amp I move to another app it will switch off directly
len ratingfive Teams is just amazing 
len ratingfive so helpful in keeping in touch with my fellow co workers
len ratingone This app is awful 
len ratingone You cant access the files for your class without leaving unmuting has a second lag and YOU COME IN CLASS UNMUTED 
len ratingone NO
len ratingtwo This app has some features that are good in theory but don t seem to work anymore in practice 
len ratingtwo In particular the calendar feature in the mobile app is in theory and once was an easy user friendly way to join meetings 
len ratingtwo However for the past several months my mobile app does not show any of my meetings for the current week though it will not helpfully display past meetings and meeting more than a week in the future 
len ratingtwo I m not sure why Microsoft seemingly can t fix this issue 
len ratingtwo The chat teams and calls features are useful and work similarly on my phone as on my desktop 
len ratingfive Very few bugs transfers calls and allows switching well b w app and PC 
len ratingfive Nicely done Microsoft 
len ratingfive yar agle update main meeting main banda mute krne ke option lao take hum teacher ke uthao ko mute kar sakhen 
len ratingfive It s simple and easy to use 
len ratingfive Nice program easy to navigate and understand 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingone IT HAS TERRIBLE EVERYTHING
len ratingone When the teacher call me the ringing sound is soooo annoying 
len ratingone Please change it thank you 
len ratingone great app easy to use 
len ratingtwo I m gobsmacked this app does not disable auto lock 
len ratingtwo Took forever to unmute as I d not seen it do that and keeping it from locking during a call was a huge pain
len ratingtwo Another title for this review might be Jack Of All Trades Master Of None This product is really not best in class for any product category 
len ratingtwo It s not the best calendar app Google s is much better and easier to share with others it s not the best video chat app Zoom is and will be the industry leader at least until maybe Microsoft buys them out and buries them as they did with Skype it s not the best messaging app Jabber or even wonky Slack are far better 
len ratingtwo It does do a fair job of integrating all these functions but at a price 
len ratingtwo Teams really bogs down your system 
len ratingtwo For me it s at a point where I just never leave teams up and running 
len ratingtwo I only open it when someone else insists on having a Teams meeting 
len ratingtwo And it doesn t play nice with other manufacturers email software such as Google or Yahoo Mail 
len ratingtwo The whole point of Teams is to force you to use Microsoft s other products 
len ratingtwo I also have concerns over privacy issues with Teams and Microsoft products in general 
len ratingtwo Teams has all sorts of nifty analytics on user behavior it can run for the owners of Teams software i e 
len ratingtwo the companies you work for 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately as long as Microsoft continues to have corporate America in its back pocket I don t see any end in sight for this product soon 
len ratingfive So Far So Good 
len ratingone What a horrible mess the Teams app is 
len ratingone They really need to figure out how to do messaging better like Slack 
len ratingone i hate this app
len ratingone I can t sign in with an existing account or make a new account 
len ratingone If I use WiFi or data does not matter the app will not do anything 
len ratingthree Teams will ROCK once monthly and full weekly calendar views are available on mobile devices 
len ratingthree And the other MS Teams apps like Channel Calendar need to be mobile enabled 
len ratingthree This functionality is critical for people in the field all day 
len ratingthree We live on our phones dontcha know 
len ratingfive Teams helps teams to function with ease and proficiency 
len ratingfive I am able to support our technicians with whatever escalation issues they face with a click away 
len ratingfive Taking control with ease and effectively solve problems 
len ratingfive Nothing fits teams better than Teams 
len ratingone My school sees everything I say like I need privacy
len ratingfive I use Teams on all of my devices 
len ratingfive I love the way they interact seamlessly from my computer to my iPad and my iPhone 
len ratingfive Very simple to share files photos GIS plans documents 
len ratingtwo Please change the sound of notification for this app 
len ratingtwo Or allow the user to choose the sound they would like 
len ratingtwo Meetings are being missed as well as calls and other important items 
len ratingtwo This portion of this app makes it terrible to use for important things 
len ratingfive Teams is really good for what I use it for I really like it
len ratingfive I like it much better than Skype
len ratingfive Teams has been a major communication center in my life from work to personal 
len ratingfive I love it and highly recommend this application for anyone no matter what your use is 
len ratingfive Finally i got the chance to attend my team meeting
len ratingone Bad don t download
len ratingfour In the heading is all I got
len ratingfive Excellent for virtual meetings informal communications and documents share 
len ratingfive Very nice app 
len ratingone  Hi guys How are u I would like you to rate Microsoft teams star rate So that we cam not study on this bad app it is not a good app for our children so pls rate it star so that we can t see this app again 
len ratingone Thank you
len ratingfour My biggest pet peeve and a that after minutes it sets me as away 
len ratingfour I m not away I just doing a part of my job that I m not on the computer for 
len ratingfour It would be nice to be able to change that 
len ratingfive Really impressed at the quality of this app 
len ratingfive I shouldn t be too surprised as it s Microsoft but they really cared about the little details 
len ratingfive My favorite feature is being able to transfer devices seemlessly 
len ratingfive Most apps don t do this well 
len ratingfive Great job MS 
len ratingone First of all I have an online class and it s just so unfair since I m currently writing this review during class since I cannot hold it for even later I can t keep my anger for this app since the unfairness is unreal 
len ratingone In of my Apple products iPad Air and iPhone mini I can t seem to access backgrounds but a blur but in my MacBook Air it s all the backgrounds you can imagine and nd why is it that in the of my devices It only sets me on list settings Not grid I find it quite annoying since I have a bit of dyslexia and I can barely spell my subjects correctly Please fix your dumb unfair app before I move on with this and I wouldn t be able to join my classes 
len ratingone  i cant update or change my profile picture on the mobile app or the desktop version 
len ratingone i ve tried on the website as well but no luck 
len ratingthree It s one of the few programs where the mobile experience trumps desktop version 
len ratingthree Desktop application is poorly optimized and uses over GB memory easily and bugs down windows and user experience
len ratingfive Items is an amazing app for my staff and I to work on 
len ratingfive I really like the app because a lot of times the internet stops working and the app can help you join a meeting on time until the internet decides to work again 
len ratingfour Hello there 
len ratingfour I hope your having a nice day 
len ratingfour I would like to share my opinion about MICROSOFT TEAMS 
len ratingfour I have had this app for and a half years and I have gone through some issues and some suggestions on it 
len ratingfour I would really like to be able to upload a video more than a minute long into the files on A IPAD 
len ratingfour Also no one can hear my audio when I share my screen to the class on A IPAD 
len ratingfour I don t know if you can do it on iPad but it would be SPECTACULAR if it would happen 
len ratingfour Mainly in iPads all the problems occur for me 
len ratingfour Like backgrounds screen share and more 
len ratingfour Also I would really like you to put back private chat 
len ratingfour Life in teams was a lot better with that so I can talk to my teacher PRIVATELY instead of always going on a conference 
len ratingfour This was my opinion on MICROSOFT TEAMS 
len ratingfour Thanks for reading 
len ratingfive I just love MS teams 
len ratingfive Always stay connected
len ratingfive I love that I can do everything on my phone that I would ever do from my office 
len ratingfive Makes being mobile much easier
len ratingthree This app is very buggy yesterday my friend call me and the call ended due to internet problem and my status stuck on in call all night long and till now it is it is am for me i tried to make calls and end it from my phone and from the desktop app and I have tried to reset my status from my phone and the desktop app with no success now I m uninstalling and reinstalling the app hopping for the best 
len ratingone  And nothing else 
len ratingfive  I give MS props for coming through and really making the office suite work 
len ratingfive I can also see that Teams has been given a lot of resources to improve and it shows 
len ratingfive I would like to see better streamlining of certain functionality Yammer Chat etc and please figure out what to do with the Skype functionality 
len ratingfive It is a great platform and while probably not making you guys a whole lot is a great way to get people used to the platform and then use office when they need to purchase an SAS for work 
len ratingfive In the end you reinvented yourself MS Bravo 
len ratingfive I m going to be with you for the inevitable future so keep it up and thank you 
len ratingfive Count me inS
len ratingone It is glitchy and nearly unusable 
len ratingone It will get stuck on one screen and flash to black over and over again 
len ratingone It won t allow you to hang up or put a call on hold turn on speakerphone or really do anything without pressing the button ten times waiting for something to happen 
len ratingone Don t even think about picking up a second call and putting the first on hold you won t be able to go back to the first call 
len ratingone The desktop app works OK 
len ratingone Daily I get error while uploading my kids assignments 
len ratingone I need to uninstall and install again to resolve this error 
len ratingone Something assignment tab is not showing in bottom menu 
len ratingone School school sucky sucky school make me cri In real the sherk script in the app seems fake Once upon a time a long time ago a king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona 
len ratingone But she was possessed by a terrible curse 
len ratingone By day a lovely princess 
len ratingone By night a hideous ogre 
len ratingone Only true love s kiss could lift her curse 
len ratingone So Fiona waited in a tower guarded by a dragon until the day when her true love would arrive 
len ratingone But as the days turned into years the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperatemeasures 
len ratingone Whoa there 
len ratingone I don t know about this Lillian 
len ratingone Fairy Godmother said only true love s kiss could break Fiona s curse 
len ratingone I don t trust that woman Harold 
len ratingone This may be our last hope 
len ratingone Besides he does come highly recommended by King Midas 
len ratingone But to put our daughter s life in the hands of this person 
len ratingone He s devious 
len ratingone He s deceitful 
len ratingone He s he s Rumpelstiltskin 
len ratingone Mrs Highness 
len ratingone How do you do 
len ratingone Down Fifi 
len ratingone Get down 
len ratingone As you can see everything s in order 
len ratingone So you ll put an end to our daughter s curse 
len ratingone And in return you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me 
len ratingone  Lillian this is madness 
len ratingone  What choice do we have 
len ratingone Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long 
len ratingone It s not like she s getting any younger 
len ratingone But to sign over our entirekingdom 
len ratingone Well if your kingdom s worth more to you than your daughter 
len ratingone Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter 
len ratingone Jump Fifi jump 
len ratingone Just sign it and all your problems will disappear 
len ratingone Your Highness 
len ratingone The Princess 
len ratingone She s been saved 
len ratingone Who saved her 
len ratingone No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek whose roar was feared throughout the land would save the beautiful PrincessFiona 
len ratingone True love s kiss led to marriage and ogre babies 
len ratingone The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace 
len ratingone Goody for them 
len ratingone And they lived happily ever after 
len ratingone Sir 
len ratingone You re gonna have to pay for that 
len ratingone Maybe we could make a deal for it little boy 
len ratingone  Oh I m not a real boy 
len ratingone  Do you want to be 
len ratingone Nobody needs your deals anymore Grumpel Stinkypants 
len ratingone I wish that ogre was never born 
len ratingone Wake up Daddy wake up 
len ratingone  Good morning 
len ratingone  Good morning to you 
len ratingone Better out than in 
len ratingone That s my line 
len ratingone Did my little Fergus make a big grownup ogre stink 
len ratingone Oh that s diabolical 
len ratingone And on your left the lovable lug that showed us you don t have to change your undies to change the world 
len ratingone I wonder what Shrek s up to in there 
len ratingone Get in there 
len ratingone Get 
len ratingone Impossible to put on 
len ratingone OK the dragon goes under the bridge through the loop and finally into the castle 
len ratingone Play date 
len ratingone Then Shrek kissed the Princess 
len ratingone She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived Happily Ever After 
len ratingone Look 
len ratingone A shooting star 
len ratingone So what did you wish for 
len ratingone That every day could be like this one 
len ratingone Come here you 
len ratingone Morning Daddy 
len ratingone Morning 
len ratingone Better out than in 
len ratingone Did my little Fergus make a 
len ratingone Cute 
len ratingone Real cute 
len ratingone This lovable lug taught us you don t have to change your undies to change the world 
len ratingone Play date 
len ratingone Shrek 
len ratingone The outhouse is cloggedup 
len ratingone She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived Happily Ever After 
len ratingone  Daddy get up 
len ratingone  Morning 
len ratingone  Better out than in 
len ratingone  This lovable lug Play date 
len ratingone  No 
len ratingone Outhouse again 
len ratingone Come on 
len ratingone Undies 
len ratingone Outhouse 
len ratingone  Get up get up 
len ratingone  And they lived Happily Ever After 
len ratingone Roar 
len ratingone Nice landing baby 
len ratingone Hey 
len ratingone Now remember don t eat the valet 
len ratingone Happy birthday nios 
len ratingone Vamos a la fiesta 
len ratingone Hey Shrek Shrek 
len ratingone Mr Shrek would you sign our pitchforks 
len ratingone And our torches 
len ratingone Oh man you used to be so fierce 
len ratingone Yeah when you were a real ogre 
len ratingone A real ogre 
len ratingone Shrek it s a sing along 
len ratingone You ve got to sing along 
len ratingone  No thanks 
len ratingone As you can see it makes no sense
len ratingone I will now have no privacy with a chat with my teacher they need to add private chat back 
len ratingthree I m trying to chat with my friends but for some reason I can t chat anymore because the new update
len ratingtwo  Please enable support for keeping the camera on while in split screen mode on iPad 
len ratingtwo It s incredibly frustrating 
len ratingtwo Zoom supports this it is technically possible to do it 
len ratingfour Ok this is a really good app except you should make you be able to see yourself 
len ratingfour It would be better that way
len ratingone Every time I open the app it loads but nothing refreshes 
len ratingone It says I am not connected to the wifi or it lost connection to the server 
len ratingone When I log on my computer everything shows up even meetings in progress 
len ratingone My phone is weeks behind nothing is loaded
len ratingfour Ok so ever since corona I have been an online student and this app is amazing 
len ratingfour I use it for school everyday 
len ratingfour There is everything u need for school on this app 
len ratingfour You have zoom and my teachers post all my assignment on this app to 
len ratingfour It even has calandra that can keep track of your work and missing assignments 
len ratingfour It also notify a you whenever your next class is coming or if you have an assigned 
len ratingfour All I can say is that it s AMAZING 
len ratingfour  recommend for school 
len ratingfour Especially if your in online like me 
len ratingfour Kk byeeee thx for taking the time to read my review 
len ratingfour The chat title bar is blocking me from choosing the top person in the chat list 
len ratingfour It s in the way 
len ratingfour The app has a good UI but it uses a lot of bandwidthX I would avoid using this app with data 
len ratingfive The MS Team app is a great tool for this COVID claimate and it allows my colleagues and I to conduct our training planning and strategic level action at the optimal and efficient level 
len ratingfive We can communicate share information on all media and compare results in real time with unlimited participation 
len ratingfive This is an excellent tool 
len ratingfive The overall app design is nicely laid out and everything is easy to find and utilize 
len ratingfive Overall a good messaging app that my place employment is leveraging and I don t really have any complaints coming from a Slack environment 
len ratingone  It looks MS has hired someone to make the user experience as frustrating as possible
len ratingone Now all I get is a sign in error 
len ratingone  Please add ability to play audio from my KEYNOTE slides presentation during TEAMS SCREEN SHARE 
len ratingone Really need this 
len ratingone Thank you for listening to this feedback 
len ratingone Want this to be a star app
len ratingfive It is a fantastic program full of features and makes it easy to be a part of a team 
len ratingfive Love the app but in the chat option it would be a great improvement if specific chats could be responded to 
len ratingfive For example we setup open channels during SIT and UAT and people are very active in the chat 
len ratingfive However if someone is busy by the time they re answering a question posed to them many other conversations have taken place 
len ratingfive To be able to respond to a specific chat within the channel would be amazing 
len ratingone I am unable to sign in through my phone and I am unable to message or speak to my teacher without turning on my laptop and signing in through there 
len ratingfive Teams is great 
len ratingfive User friendly and much easier to use than Zoom any day 
len ratingfour Sometimes when others share screen it is not visible 
len ratingfive Very intuitive seamless and fun to use 
len ratingfive Love the integration with my iPhone and my pc office suite
len ratingthree Way to easy to accidentally activate video when using this app on mobile 
len ratingthree Needs to be some type of confirmation or safety before it just broadcasts it all 
len ratingthree And considering this app filters the GIFs you can use to work appropriate ones well it s just surprising how quickly and easily you can broadcast your own graphic content 
len ratingone There s no option to disable spotlight option 
len ratingone I m spotlighted whenever I join the class and there is no option to remove it 
len ratingone I stopped using teams on Mobile just because of this issue 
len ratingone Otherwise it was great 
len ratingone Nothing works
len ratingone title speaks for itself
len ratingone More than a year since the pandemic virtual background is still not available in iOS version of Teams 
len ratingone Are you guys purely ignore this 
len ratingone Even crappy zoom has it for years 
len ratingone VirtualBackgrounds 
len ratingone VirtualBackgrounds 
len ratingone VirtualBackgrounds 
len ratingone It s been months since the pandemic where is virtual background for iOS teams 
len ratingone How long does it take a Microsoft team engineers to add the feature to add customized backdrop change loop video clip and picture to the phone app 
len ratingone Never 
len ratingone Come on guys it s not that hard to code and it s an important feature to have 
len ratingone Any other group video chat apps out there can do that already 
len ratingone Do you guys really want to wait till the Pandemic is over and then add this feature 
len ratingone I have to go o this app every day and it lags all the time no matter we re I am
len ratingfive  Are yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Oogabooga
len ratingone Have my daughter a seizure
len ratingfive Great application 
len ratingfive I m able to connect with my team even if I m on the shop floor 
len ratingone poop
len ratingfive Imagine working remotely and the WiFi goes out while you re logged in 
len ratingfive That just happened to me and this app made it so easy for me to reach out to my manager to let him know the situation 
len ratingfive And to still work with colleagues on other matters that don t require WiFi for the hour or so until it s back up and running 
len ratingfive Thanks for making it easy to communicate professionally in any situation 
len ratingfive Wonderful app definitely recommend
len ratingone I just hate it 
len ratingfour What I love right now about teams I like the design of the app Easy to use for students of all ages not necessarily having a cellphone with data but a way to see everything mobile in one place has been worth it 
len ratingfour Ex 
len ratingfour Class notebook assignments teacher posts etc 
len ratingfour  Meetings in mobile has saved me a couple of times at first when we did not have a battery backup at home for our setups and main internet it was a plan b but now we stay a bit more calmed since we use battery backups and they last around an hour but in the rise of needing to go to medical checkups etc at least in my case Not necessarily participating but at least being a part of the class in someway even doh was a bit limited was a good thing to not miss out on school work or important stuff Features I would like to see on upcoming updates the ability to unlock the app with a factor of authentication using the outlook mobile app with the second factor of authentication has been great and it provides a piece of mind cause someone might have your phone code but not your finger touch ID or face ID 
len ratingfour Great feature I love of the outlook app wish I have it on here improve overall stability of the app sometimes slows down a bit or crashes is not constant but it can be my phone since I m running iPhone But overall a great application on mobile and would love to see the app grow over the years since at least this is staying for us
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone Before the latest update I was able to connect to out teams meetings 
len ratingone Now I can t 
len ratingone It rings once only then shuts down and kicks me out
len ratingone This ap is ridiculous 
len ratingone it s so glitchy and is always flashing on and off to where you can t even click on anything 
len ratingone Poor poor ap 
len ratingfive When of the easier programs to use 
len ratingfive I would like to see some camera filters added to the basic program 
len ratingone Doesn t consistently work 
len ratingone On any given day it won t receive calls won t dial calls won t hang up from calls just an all around pain to deal with 
len ratingthree Generally a pretty good means of communication 
len ratingthree Could be enhanced by the following Provide a means of organizing the teams a user is involved with 
len ratingthree Currently this is overwhelming to have to search manually 
len ratingthree  A better means of identifying when you have been contacted via chat 
len ratingthree Currently have the pop up and the Teams icon stays lit 
len ratingthree Many times both of these are missed by users 
len ratingthree  A means of segregating out chats from meeting participants such as BRB back need to drop etc 
len ratingthree These clog the system and makes it difficult to identify when you have an actual chat that needs your attention 
len ratingfour Mobile app does not have same functionality as the pc version 
len ratingfour Would like to see the mobile app improve
len ratingone  IT GAVE SCHOOL WORK
len ratingfive We started using Microsoft teams at the beginning of Covid last year and it has really changed the way we do things in veterinary medicine 
len ratingfive It has changed how we communicate with our staff our clients and our doctors and being from a large doctor hospital which is two floors it has really made us much more efficient in the way we do our daily tasks 
len ratingfive The best thing I love about it is that I can use it to work remotely from home as long as other colleagues 
len ratingfive With the help of this new technology and other upcoming applications it seems that the future is bright for veterinary medicine 
len ratingfour To get me to a state of loving this there needs to be additions 
len ratingfour An easier way way to access voicemail from PTSN calls other than the tiny icon in the Calling tab and more importantly a way to easily silence send all calls to voicemail calls after hours 
len ratingfour It s not always practical to put up an out of office message in Outlook to accomplish this 
len ratingtwo I wish this app stop freezing so I can attach a couple files 
len ratingtwo And I wish they need to bring back the cellphone thing 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive My class saidI m not pleased and they re having a lot of issues lately can you please fix it
len ratingone just remove the app from the store 
len ratingthree A bunch of glitches wich is annoying I prefer going back to my own school this app is really glitchy and sometimes u can t hear the other person that talking so u completely don t know what to put but good app I guess 
len ratingone  microsoft
len ratingfive Teams is great to use for small meetings For larger meetings it would be great to have everyone muted and have a person have to hold down their space bar to speak 
len ratingfive Once someone is holding down their space bar no other audio can come in It will also be great to be able to share two different screens for interactive collaborative working sessions just like having two computer screens at work
len ratingone Simply if the review enables be to give s negative mark will go for it 
len ratingone So baaaaaaad
len ratingone Cheap garbage platform only use cause of school
len ratingfive I love the teams app I use it for my virtual classes and rarely have any problems 
len ratingfive One problem I often have is that in the chat when someone shares a photo amp you press close it is placed where the leave button is and I accidentally leave 
len ratingfive Great and recommend for many but that s just the only problem 
len ratingthree It made my bussy stink
len ratingfour Microsoft should add the ability for picture in picture on teams
len ratingone While there are many promising aspects in Teams the number of bugs and usage issues are almost inexcusable 
len ratingone For example downloading files times out when downloading more than one large video at a time even on a connect getting mbs down and up 
len ratingone Additionally the battery drain using Teams is more than double what Zoom uses and yes I ve check 
len ratingone That means Teams will last hours on my Mac and hours on my iPad Pro 
len ratingfive Love it makes
len ratingtwo First teams was solid stars no bugs no bad stuff it was absolutely blasting me but NOWWW IT IS SOO BAD EVERY TIME I JOIN I CANT MUTE OR UNMUTE AND IT CRASHES EVERY SINGLE TIME WHYYY FIX IT PLZZ EVERYTIME I JOIN SCHOOL I GET CRASHED SOLVE IT PLZ
len ratingfive MS Teams is the absolute best way to communicate professionally with others 
len ratingfive The app almost perfectly mimics the web desktop app 
len ratingfive Some features are not available on the phone app but it s so minimal you won t even notice 
len ratingfive How you are didn t call your this app 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingone I HATE IT SO MUCH I WILL NEVER REINSTALL IT AGAIN THIS IS SO STUPID AND STRESSFUL I HAVE TO DO ALL OF THE STEPS ALL OVER AND OVER AGAIN
len ratingone  Title says it all
len ratingone Make an option for dark mode to be system default or automatically etc
len ratingfour Allow the space bar to be a quick MUTE rather than Ctrl M 
len ratingfour Allow holding the space bar to talk and releasing to mute 
len ratingfour Allow the user to expand his or her own video window 
len ratingone Terrible app 
len ratingone O is also garbage 
len ratingone How about look into fixing old issues before adding new features nobody wants 
len ratingone The masses are beta testing this garbage while end users suffer 
len ratingone By the the time it starts working you completely redesign it with a whole new slew of bugs 
len ratingone Amateur hour 
len ratingthree Sometimes it goes into loop with Authenticator and you really can t use it until you force kill few times wait for min and then re launch 
len ratingone The reason is because I go on school on here so make it low so it can get deleted 
len ratingone First of all the login procedure is a joke and ridiculous 
len ratingone Second when I finally do get to the point I login the app starts to load and then crashes roughly seconds into the Teams logo 
len ratingone EVERYTIME iPhone XS Max
len ratingfive It s the best way to productively collaborate together with your co workers
len ratingfour User experience is pretty friendly 
len ratingfour I ve also used Slack and Teams is a bit behind in a few areas but for not being a top priority platform for Microsoft it s pretty good 
len ratingfour Areas to improve Are there any bots that can integrate to help automate channel creation etc Emoji game is lacking a bit Integrated notifications
len ratingfour Best overall 
len ratingfour Very comprehensive communication tools 
len ratingfour Simple and easier to use than others with less learning curve 
len ratingfour Functionality could be smoother and more intuitively integrated 
len ratingone minus it fills my phone data unsure why 
len ratingone have to delete and reinstall 
len ratingone weekly 
len ratingthree Castanet support is slow and almost non responsive
len ratingfive Mobile phone and laptop Teams allow me instant connection in urgent situations and also freedom 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingthree Custom background on mobile same as PC 
len ratingthree Ability to mute people who are talking so that you can t hear them while others can 
len ratingone Although a tremendous amendments have been made to the app as an English teacher I can t use the app for my classes because the feature of including audio system is still missing 
len ratingone Can t join any meetings 
len ratingone Had to delete it about times 
len ratingone Kicks me out and doesn t let me rejoin 
len ratingone Waste of space 
len ratingone Too bad my work needs it but if it was a choice I would delete this app from my phone 
len ratingfive I like this app a lot for online school work and so much more 
len ratingfive But over all of that I can t hear people it says I have another account on and that s all
len ratingone App on phone started getting all of my messages and desktop app was only receiving messages I initiated from the desktop 
len ratingone Can t work like this so uninstalled the app 
len ratingone Attempted to give feedback to MS but that seems to require installing another app and some going up for something else 
len ratingone I really no longer understand how to use MS apps and tools anymore 
len ratingone They all seem to have such limited scope of use now 
len ratingfive Works exactly like the computer software 
len ratingfive Excellent App
len ratingthree My work requires me to have it on my phone which I m not sure why becsuse I m on my computer all day for work 
len ratingthree But what I really don t like is if I m on the application on my desktop it doesn t mirror to the phone so I get notifications if someone messages me 
len ratingthree It s incredibly frustrating to be on a chat with someone or a meeting and can see their message and then get a notification on my phone that they ve messaged me yes I know they have I am talking with them 
len ratingthree It d be great if they could figure something out to notice that oh this person is logged in desktop 
len ratingone  I shouldn t have to download the app every day to get my account to log in 
len ratingfive Perfect in use
len ratingfive Hi Love the app just not in love with it yet 
len ratingfive Here are just a couple of suggestions on how to make it better 
len ratingfive The ability to delete chats would be ideal 
len ratingfive Hiding isn t enough since they pop up again later 
len ratingfive Why cant we reply back in a chat using the desktop version 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone This app is best out of all video calling apps for working 
len ratingone I use this almost everyday but there are things that are very frustrating 
len ratingone First of all there is much lag between callers and sometimes it kicks us out of meetings 
len ratingone Also sometimes I can t enter assignments when I need to and it takes forever to send messages in the app or in the meeting chat 
len ratingone This is a BIG problem which is why it s addressed first 
len ratingone Second of all the assignments can be very confusing and difficult to manage 
len ratingone This should be organized better so it is easier to find what to look for 
len ratingone This is also very confusing with returned assignment with chat 
len ratingone Third there is a glitch with the blur camera setting 
len ratingone I like to have my camera on during meetings with blur 
len ratingone I turn this on during the middle of meetings 
len ratingone If I turn it off for some reason I cannot enable it 
len ratingone This is very aggravating 
len ratingone Please fix this soon 
len ratingone I have some suggestions to maybe look at 
len ratingone Maybe make a personal agenda area it would make life so much easier 
len ratingone Also organization would be very nice 
len ratingone Sometimes this app makes things very complicated and difficult to do simple things 
len ratingone Overall it s a pretty good app but has terrible problems that need to be fixed 
len ratingone edit Ok so now I m even more mad 
len ratingone So I can t access assignments anymore through the team or activity I have to go all the way to the assignments tab 
len ratingone THIS IS SO ANNOYING 
len ratingone FIX THIS GLITCH 
len ratingone All of my co workers agree I gave this stars originally but now it s down to a ONE 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingfive An excellent mobile version of an app I have to use daily 
len ratingfive Perfectly adapted for mobile use 
len ratingfive Works fast and good features
len ratingone  Super glitchy 
len ratingone makes my screen turn black
len ratingone A notification coming from the app told me to do bad things to my self very bad website as a teacher I do not condone robots telling my students and my personal kids to do very bad things to them self I liked the app but not anymore 
len ratingfive Lovely app
len ratingfive Using it for our work stations is awesome because it limits people from leaving and just get into a chat right there
len ratingone On a company videocon today in Teams while driving 
len ratingone The option to stop incoming video did not work after repeated attempts all I wanted was audio 
len ratingone So in minutes I burned all my Verizon data for the month 
len ratingone Thanks low caste Microsoft engineers 
len ratingfive Convenient and informative sessions 
len ratingone I hate school 
len ratingfive Works
len ratingtwo When in a Teams call On mobile I can t open the teams app to use the calendar or to text chat other users or any teams features for that matter 
len ratingtwo Only the active call seems to be offered and available via the app 
len ratingtwo I can t seem to get the main app hoping to use the other apps features
len ratingfive Perfect for work from anywhere 
len ratingfive I love that I can use this app on my iPhone 
len ratingfive I can message co workers from anywhere and even participate in meetings in hands free mode from my vehicle 
len ratingfive The app itself is very reliable and never crashes 
len ratingfive Cell signal strength has an obvious affect on call quality so it is sometimes best to turn off video transmit from your side 
len ratingfive Five star rating from me for convenience and reliability 
len ratingone When my teacher shares her screen it dose not share and she try using her cam but it is frozen it is really bad please fix
len ratingfive Ok I really like this app I use it for school and also I found it very fun and easy to use and also its even better on my laptop so yeah good work 
len ratingone Nos castigan con mucha tarea
len ratingfive What would I do without TEAMS game changer 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive I like the instant contact
len ratingone Have an Iphone the app crashes after a few seconds
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfour The Teams iOS needs the ability to spotlight like the Mac and PC app 
len ratingfive This app is pretty cool 
len ratingfive How it differentiates from Skpe and others you can look at the screen sharing function allowing the person you are talking not only view your screen but take control of yours 
len ratingfive The mobile function is easy and functions just as good as WhatsApp amp others 
len ratingfive Video amp sound quality is good 
len ratingfive Security is solid as you can set up a pin to log on so personal info is safe 
len ratingfive My only gripe is the inability to delete messages 
len ratingfive Maybe I just haven t figured out how yet 
len ratingfive Overall it s great for businesses to keep in touch with employees 
len ratingfive For example I m in Dubai amp I communicate with colleagues in Iraq the US and Afghanistan seamlessly 
len ratingfive We had over employees on one call and the connection remained strong 
len ratingfive Most definitely recommend A 
len ratingfive If teams can pride the function showing my private moments will be better for us 
len ratingfive You can easily excess to work whenever you need it without constantly going back and forth 
len ratingfive I like how it is on my phone so if I need to send a message to my managers I can and not have to wait till morning or over the weekend to get in touch with them 
len ratingfive I love how I can see my schedule request days off or pick up more work 
len ratingone I am online student and I m suffering from boredom 
len ratingfive Useful application to keep you connected with your office when you do not have your work computer available 
len ratingfive Very simple and intuitive UI 
len ratingfive Teams extends the office to infinity and beyond the office will never be stationary again 
len ratingfive There is nothing you can t bring together 
len ratingfive Long live Teams 
len ratingfour  Some days I CANT get to my classes on time bc of teams not working other than that the app is great for meetings
len ratingthree I like teams in general 
len ratingthree It s useful to communicate within employees 
len ratingthree The only downside is that meeting shows only limited number of videos of participants 
len ratingthree It s increased to but compare to zoom which allows to show all videos of the uses by scrolling Teams meeting function is not very good 
len ratingthree I don t know for what reason but the app keeps closing up 
len ratingthree I open it and I can see the screen for a second and then the app just closes 
len ratingthree I have removed the app and downloaded it again but I still have the same problem 
len ratingone I should be able to color coordinate my different chats as well as put them in order of importance 
len ratingone I should be able to delete old chats not hide them 
len ratingone Also when conducting a meeting from my phone is complicated to share screen and the sound does not come through 
len ratingone It s a waste of time 
len ratingtwo I seriously hate this app for many reasons but one of them is the are you still here thing 
len ratingtwo Why would you get kicked out of the meeting when you get back 
len ratingtwo It s extremely annoying 
len ratingtwo I was trying to copy and paste the meeting link in the chat but instead I got kicked out of both tabs forcing me to reload which ruins the whole tab because then it just becomes a blank screen 
len ratingone Poor quality of product call connection and lot of other stuff 
len ratingfive Love to not shout across the room 
len ratingthree Yeah bc off school
len ratingfive Great place
len ratingtwo I create a channel for my members but I only want my self the owner can create post 
len ratingtwo I don t allow other members to create post 
len ratingtwo And i don t have any control to delete others post even I am the owner 
len ratingfive Everything s clear the audio amp video 
len ratingtwo  Shouldn t automatically makeup users busy while in meeting Phone app and desk app doesn t always sync Have to close and reopen for the app to work again to connect Too many issues and lag Slack is better four collaboration 
len ratingfour I would like to write to the creators of this app because I would like to recommend a new change 
len ratingfour In the assignments tab under the assigned my returned assignments are there 
len ratingfour This is a little annoying because I cannot clearly see my current assignments 
len ratingfour To view my current assignments clearly I need to click on the returned assignments for them to disappear 
len ratingfour I think it might be a glitch or something but fixing this would really help 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingfive We re using teams for WFH and it s been an easy road 
len ratingfive Chats meeting scheduling and sharing screens are a few tasks that are smooth and integrated 
len ratingtwo Overall it is a good app to use for my classes but if the teachers don t figure out how to make kids attendees the kids can kick each other out put hands down mute other students and the teacher 
len ratingtwo Sometimes I have trouble pinning someone like my teacher and it s annoying to have to figure out how to fix it 
len ratingtwo My school uses it for all of our online meetings and it is a pretty good choice 
len ratingtwo This app works great 
len ratingtwo However the reason I am giving only stars is because this app doesn t allow to download files directly from the app to your choice of location in your local computer folders 
len ratingtwo The only way to download files to your choice of location is to open a file in a browser and save as 
len ratingfive  I enjoy teams and the ease by which I can attend all my scheduled meetings in one place 
len ratingfive The video calls and sharing files are easier than ever 
len ratingfive My company moved away from Slack and I am glad that they did
len ratingfive This is an awesome tool me and my team love it 
len ratingthree Add a delete all function
len ratingone I would rate a zero if I could this app is unacceptable 
len ratingfive It has slowly grown on me 
len ratingfive The calls have improved and it has become more user friendly it still needs improvement but it fulfills its purpose 
len ratingthree  You ve done a nice job overall but you are lacking CarPlay support 
len ratingthree You should be able to see the calendar of upcoming meetings and join one audio only via internet or call me from the interface 
len ratingthree I ve joined calls via the internet from the handset before and they keep dropping 
len ratingfive Chat call organize and have one central base of operations for all your employees it has tons of add ins and too many features to list 
len ratingfive If you liked Skype for business it s precursor you ll love Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive Go seamlessly from desktop to iOS platform and keep connected on the go or away from your desk to collaborate effectively with your 
len ratingfive TEAM 
len ratingtwo It s very glitchy and everyday I do school after my break I can join back in the meeting
len ratingfive So my daughter uses this app for class and connecting with her friends 
len ratingfive But when her friends are in another shcool she can t communicate with her other friends 
len ratingfive Please make it to communicate with other people 
len ratingfive Thank you if you read this 
len ratingfive It is extremely versatile 
len ratingfive Much better that Skype was 
len ratingfive More stable and light in terms of bandwidth consumption 
len ratingfive I really love that works extremely well in my mobile and also that o can alternate and simultaneously connect wi RRHH my laptop and mobile 
len ratingthree There are a lot of quirks such it trying to fit high res screens into the small viewing area 
len ratingthree Don t know why they haven t made the ribbon bars smaller or collapsible 
len ratingthree Also expect mouse issues with dragging and highlighting on ms windows 
len ratingfive Using this App for work and it is so awesome 
len ratingfive I love that work is now easily accessible on the go or from home 
len ratingfive Has everything I need so far to do anything I would if I was at my work station 
len ratingfive Good for company meeting
len ratingfive Love it but needs work
len ratingfour Shortcuts would be helpful for knowledge management purposes 
len ratingtwo  The app crashes at least once a day while transferring calls and you cant transfer straight to vm from the app 
len ratingfive We use this product
len ratingthree App provides functionality but is not that intuitive 
len ratingthree Find that it will randomly close from time to time and there are sometimes issues when connected to wifi as opposed to cellular network Verizon which seems to work best 
len ratingthree Capability to take calls on the go is great but the GUI could be better in my opinion 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfour Good software for office communication and knowledge sharing 
len ratingfour Teams Group features Digibots task assignment features are extremely good Screen sharing needs improvement 
len ratingfour Overall application is heavy should be made lighter 
len ratingone ITS WORSE THAN GRISHA JAEGER AS A DAD I HATE IT
len ratingfive What can I say 
len ratingfive MS screwed up so many before and finally got one correct it seems 
len ratingfive Many you could take out the Sigh in
len ratingfive Constant updates are improving things little by little and the changes are subtle enough to keep things similar enough to almost miss 
len ratingfive I currently use Teams for work daily for all types of communication 
len ratingfive I would like to see the reply feature on this app added to the desktop app to prevent having to use the Format Quote Copy Paste Enter Enter process 
len ratingfive Feels like I m entering a cheat code on an old video game 
len ratingfive Keep making it better MS 
len ratingfour I have used Microsoft Apps in my online classes and it is amazing 
len ratingfour I have downloaded the iPhone app and iPad app 
len ratingfour However the app is very glitchy 
len ratingfour Sometimes the teacher cuts off the call 
len ratingfour When I am sharing my screen my mouse disappears 
len ratingfour They should fix that 
len ratingfour Aside from that I highly recommend this app 
len ratingthree Good functionality but seems inefficient 
len ratingthree When trying to add a photo or do other actions it frequently freezes for a while 
len ratingthree I thought it was just my old phone but I just got an iPhone which is wicked fast and teams still struggles 
len ratingfour The app has worked great on my iPad and I usually use it on there versus my laptop 
len ratingfour However since I use it for work the only real drawback is not being able to filter the background and use one my company provides with our logo 
len ratingfour Not sure why the iPad app is lacking this feature when the computer app has it 
len ratingfour It would be very helpful if this was correct as soon as possible 
len ratingtwo I am a student and if my laptop doesn t work then I am forced to use my phone to go to class and it s so frustrating when in class because for some odd reason my phone screen turns black for a couple of seconds and I can t do anything and it would do this all the time and it makes it so hard for me to go to class then it takes so long to load when I have good internet plus the app kicks me out of the entire app and I have to restart the app so that it but please fix these issues
len ratingfive I love the app and that it lets me be pretty much mobile anytime anywhere 
len ratingfive The only thing I think needs to be added is an option for creating polls and forms within the app while you re presenting on your computer 
len ratingfour Great for chat not sure about video calls 
len ratingone I lost all information because of a safety breach
len ratingfive Honestly I hate school but when I used this app I started loving school you can download your projects it s so amazing I highly recommend this app
len ratingone Can we get rid of this app I dont want to do school anymore D
len ratingone I finally had to delete the app 
len ratingone My international chats were waking me up 
len ratingone I tried everything to silence them but there is no option on iPhone 
len ratingone What a disappointment 
len ratingfive We used to have Skype for work 
len ratingfive Recently switched it to Teams 
len ratingfive I use IMs a lot 
len ratingfive I prefer communication on IMs over emails 
len ratingfive This app updates in real time super fast 
len ratingfour  teams 
len ratingone Code won t let you join a cross cloud meeting as a guest 
len ratingone Fix your code
len ratingfour It should accept teams setup 
len ratingfour I am x company employee but working for a client y I cannot set both of the company teams on my phone 
len ratingfour Thank you Parul Goyal
len ratingone  My tittle told you
len ratingfive Great platform but needs a delete feature to delete documents chats 
len ratingfive Etc 
len ratingfive Great App
len ratingthree Why am i getting a notification everytime someone says something in the meeting which im sitting in
len ratingone I know my network isn t the best but i can use any other app with ease while using teams chats take ages to lead even when i want to sign in it always fails and ask me to refresh 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingthree I use this app for school and sometimes I feel like it glitches a lot more than usual 
len ratingthree I think there should be a way you can seen if someone s having internet problems though 
len ratingtwo The last two updates have made this app totally unstable 
len ratingtwo It crashes frequently and will default back to reports and messages from over a month ago as the last read 
len ratingtwo This is a problem especially when working in areas where a good data connection is hard to get 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingtwo The app is in general great and Microsoft has invested in the development of Teams as a platform integrating several functionalities 
len ratingtwo But it is unfortunate that the main one which is to communicate is problematic on the iPad 
len ratingtwo Conversations are echoed and the caller on the other side hears his own voice 
len ratingtwo It is not a hardware issue because with FaceTime does not happens 
len ratingtwo It is a software problem 
len ratingtwo Probably a simple one 
len ratingtwo Why doesn t Microsoft fix it 
len ratingtwo For that reason I cannot rate it above two stars 
len ratingone I downloaded this for an interview a few weeks ago and it brought dozens of viruses onto my device 
len ratingone I keep getting pop ups asking me if some application with a gibberish name dw and some numbers can manage various apps 
len ratingone Teams also nonconsensually downloaded ITSELF into other computers I was logged into 
len ratingone Creepy 
len ratingone I uninstalled it weeks ago and it s still trying to send malware gibberish to manage my other apps 
len ratingone Wish I knew how to delete it completely 
len ratingone When in a meeting and invited to a meeting there are too many message pop ups even if you re not actually joined the meeting 
len ratingone It s very distracting and each message has its own notification box which fills up the display screen 
len ratingfive  I Love Teams so much and it guides you through getting started from scratch 
len ratingfive I see this will be one of my business s hugest assets 
len ratingfive Thank you again Microsoft for another genius idea 
len ratingfive In our highly mobile society with my team of working virtual I simply could not do my job without the Teams interface on my phone 
len ratingfive I thought when we first started using Teams that layering it on top of our existing project management platform and our email comm would be overwhelming 
len ratingfive Instead it has become the duct tape super glue that keeps all the flying bits joined together operationally 
len ratingfour Transitions are difficult especially for large companies 
len ratingfour The transition for us has been amazingly simple 
len ratingfour The results have been astonishing 
len ratingfour We are now collaborating in real time and exchanging data that is preserved through the teams filter 
len ratingfour I am pleasantly surprised and gratefully excited about what Teams and the folks at Microsoft have in store next 
len ratingfour Thanks Uncle Bill 
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingtwo  i cant update or change my profile picture on the mobile or desktop app all it shows is my initials 
len ratingthree When a call is scheduled when though you are not on the call it shows on call and not available 
len ratingthree Can we differentiate the ppl on call vs not on call 
len ratingfour Works great for all the meetings I have and for communicating with a large group of people it does have the tendency to log you out without you knowing which causes you to miss notifications
len ratingone I don t like this app it s horrible
len ratingone Since the last update notifications are broken the app requires me to login EVERY time I click on a notification 
len ratingone I m having to open the app from my home screen manually being careful not to click a notification 
len ratingone Extremely annoying this is a work app after all 
len ratingtwo The app used to work great but here in the last couple of weeks it has been extremely laggy 
len ratingtwo I can see messages come to my Home Screen but when I open the app they aren t there in the thread yet 
len ratingtwo So I have to pull down to refresh 
len ratingtwo Then force close the app reopen the app then pull down to refresh and then I can see the new message in the thread 
len ratingtwo This is all highly ineffective and causes me to have to just be by my computer more so after work to make sure I can see and respond to messages 
len ratingtwo Which is like working before when the iPhone was released 
len ratingtwo I have updated the app to the latest version and even uninstalled and reinstalled it 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Would recommend 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingfive The app is great however one issue I have is when you click the play button to play an audio message it states can t play message the first time the button is pressed 
len ratingfive  IPhone Plus 
len ratingtwo iPhone app keeps giving switching error popup 
len ratingtwo It won t load either personal account Created without my consent or organization account 
len ratingtwo Have to force close the application and restart 
len ratingtwo Will work for a while and then again same issue 
len ratingone It has terrible functions and whenever there is a lag in my internet it kicks me out 
len ratingtwo You can call people
len ratingthree Y enviar mensajes 
len ratingthree Es m s r pida la conversaci n por aplicaci n de escritorio
len ratingfour  Please add custom backgrounds as available on the desktop app 
len ratingfive I STILL HATE ONLINE SCHOOL THOUGH
len ratingthree It was working great then a pop up asking me to enter credentials to log in 
len ratingtwo Love the app 
len ratingtwo Solid for collaboration 
len ratingtwo However when I am in a teams call on my phone it makes my phone bug out to the point of being unusable 
len ratingtwo Screen goes black apps don t load screen is unresponsive and overall it s a bad time 
len ratingtwo I don t know why this is happening but please fix ASAP 
len ratingfive I do enjoy the integration of all things business and communication related 
len ratingfive It is how things should be 
len ratingfive Intuitive interface makes it very user friendly 
len ratingone A few questions It s Microsoft why don t you have a vibrate option for notifications 
len ratingone Do you just assume everyone can have their phone at full volume ringer at all times 
len ratingone That they keep the app open at all times 
len ratingone Wasn t this app designed for business use 
len ratingone Where do you get off 
len ratingfour This app is good in terms of features and other aspects 
len ratingfour I d have given stars had I not faced faced issues related to status changes 
len ratingfour It shows different status to others until it is at least mins after I login 
len ratingfour This is incorrect 
len ratingfour I never faced this with other messaging apps such as Slack or Sametime 
len ratingthree Here s why I m saying that well first it s super super laggy 
len ratingthree It s so laggy to the point I have to re open the app a lot of times just to get in the app 
len ratingthree I can t even go on my assignments because of the lag 
len ratingthree The websites crashes a lot even when my WiFi is good it still crashes for no reason 
len ratingthree Last but not least it s super slow I hate to say it but Microsoft is just the slowest out of all sites 
len ratingone I have so much trouble
len ratingfive Really happy with how easy Teams is to use and the meetings are so much more clear and easily connected then other services 
len ratingfive The chat function is my favorite out person workgroup are all easily accessible and saves tons of time looking each other up 
len ratingthree This app has most of the functionality of the desktop version but seems like Microsoft did the bare minimum just so they can offer an iPad app 
len ratingthree The app is ok it ll get you by in a pinch yet it looks vastly different that the desktop version making it difficult to find many of the various tools you may use 
len ratingthree Come on Microsoft put a little bit more of an effort 
len ratingone  This app is a very nice application but there are many things to improve in this app 
len ratingone Assignments assignments don t open on Microsoft teams just it open on Microsoft forms u need to bring a solution for this 
len ratingone No sound sometimes we can t hear the teachers sounds There is much more but those are the most important thing 
len ratingone Hope you improve it 
len ratingone And thank you 
len ratingfive It team up well with my mobile device 
len ratingone Me da depresi n
len ratingone Constantly going down and i m tryna learn like really microsoft
len ratingone The app crashes after I create a meeting and select it 
len ratingone The details on the meeting are blank 
len ratingone When you select it the app crashes every single time 
len ratingtwo I ve had success using Teams as a desktop application but the iPhone version does not maintain the screen screen goes black and locks out in the middle of the meeting unless I keep tapping the screen to keep it awake 
len ratingtwo This is very frustrating and I can t find a solution 
len ratingfive This is one of the best product from Microsoft after windows office products 
len ratingfive I love this 
len ratingfive This is obviously one of the best product from Microsoft
len ratingthree Teams is a great app at least you think it is 
len ratingthree Teams spends so much time on making things fancy that they forget to actually fix bugs 
len ratingthree Next the camera quality is trash 
len ratingthree In teams meetings it looks so bad I d rather use zoom if i could 
len ratingthree PLS 
len ratingfive This app is really good you can host a meeting and all sorts of stuff doesn t lack of features 
len ratingfive I recommend it for work business and maybe even gaming 
len ratingfive One technical problem is I work on my iPad so I can t type in the chat and when I go on my computer to check it lets me type so I definitely recommend working on a computer But overall I recommend this app 
len ratingfour I wish I could see my other chats while I am in a call
len ratingone System has issues and they take their sweet time to fix it 
len ratingone The amount of backwards things I have to do just to view my schedule is a nightmare
len ratingone  This app may be great on other devices but has major compatibility issues with the rd gen iPad Pro 
len ratingone Crashes all the time and will not allow me to send invitations for my meeting before crashing every time I select a meeting 
len ratingthree Stop annoying me 
len ratingfive Extremely easy to navigate without lacking on function and performance 
len ratingfive This app has been a lifesaver for work and personal life 
len ratingone This has to be the only app I ve seen that takes seconds after clicking the camera button to load the camera to be able to take a photo 
len ratingone Also after hitting the shutter button it takes another seconds for it to snap the photo 
len ratingone  star for making me difficult to see calendar 
len ratingone Still have not figured out where to find
len ratingtwo The notifications used to work fine 
len ratingtwo Now even though I have it specifically turned off to not notify me of incoming Teams calls it still comes up and still shows in my phone log 
len ratingtwo Super annoying because it used to work as designed and now calls show up anyway 
len ratingtwo They even come during quiet hours which is stupid 
len ratingtwo What s the point of quiet hours if you re still going to get notifications for calls 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingone Kill urself
len ratingone  Microsoft teams is the worst app available in the world
len ratingthree  This app is best out of all video calling apps for working 
len ratingthree I use this almost everyday but there are things that are very frustrating 
len ratingthree First of all there is much lag between callers and sometimes it kicks us out of meetings 
len ratingthree Also sometimes I can t enter assignments when I need to and it takes forever to send messages in the app or in the meeting chat 
len ratingthree This is a BIG problem which is why it s addressed first 
len ratingthree Second of all the assignments can be very confusing and difficult to manage 
len ratingthree This should be organized better so it is easier to find what to look for 
len ratingthree This is also very confusing with returned assignment with chat 
len ratingthree Third there is a glitch with the blur camera setting 
len ratingthree I like to have my camera on during meetings with blur 
len ratingthree I turn this on during the middle of meetings 
len ratingthree If I turn it off for some reason I cannot enable it 
len ratingthree This is very aggravating 
len ratingthree Please fix this soon 
len ratingthree I have some suggestions to maybe look at 
len ratingthree Maybe make a personal agenda area it would make life so much easier 
len ratingthree Also organization would be very nice 
len ratingthree Sometimes this app makes things very complicated and difficult to do simple things 
len ratingthree Overall it s a pretty good app but has terrible problems that need to be fixed 
len ratingfive In a company of over employees it s always tough to keep everyone on the same page and moving in the right direction 
len ratingfive Teams makes this easier to achieve and gives people no excuses to say they didn t get the message lol 
len ratingfive Wish I would ve had this decades ago 
len ratingone Doctors force us to open the mic and camera and they consider in our Arab society to diminish our religion values 
len ratingone I hope that these properties will be cancelled from students and kept them to doctors because they harm Microsoft s reputation and I hope to accept a view with full respect
len ratingone A cuenta de esa puta aplicaci n tengo que levantarme temprano pa cojer las clases puta 
len ratingtwo That I can t enter to my assessment because it said there a problem try again later and im sad because the assessment is due today and its cost points and i feel that this is the first time it had happened to me 
len ratingfive I use this app for most things 
len ratingfive I m a th grade student and I use this app for school 
len ratingfive I use this for school and for calling friends after school hours 
len ratingfive It s super cool and better than regular calling and FaceTime because you can share your screen 
len ratingone I HATE ONLINE SCHOOL 
len ratingone Am sorry Its good but online schools made it bad
len ratingtwo  i ve been using teams for the whole school year and i haven t had any issues with it i use it on my iphone school laptop and iPad 
len ratingtwo But recently none of my assignments are loading on my apple devices it says that none of my teachers have assigned anything but when i go on my laptop it shows all the assignments i have 
len ratingtwo I deleted teams off my iphone and logged back in and now it won t even let me log back in anymore it says error every time 
len ratingtwo i even turned my phone off and updated it but that didn t fix it 
len ratingtwo I just need to do my school work 
len ratingone Too many bugs
len ratingfive It s great for school and just to chat but on a phone you can t update it
len ratingfour I love teams it s an amazing app and i use it to chat with my friends due to the pandemic and everything going on but when I try to log in it says sign in error and I was trying to log in on my school account and my personal account I use my personal account to sign into home but they didn t gave me that option anymore oh and whenever I try to startup the app it directly sends me into the personal account instead 
len ratingone Great 
len ratingone I have asignments late because of how glitchy and trash this app is 
len ratingone IT WONT LET ME OPEN ASSIGNMENTS 
len ratingone And i cant do it on computer since there isn t a camera 
len ratingone My teacher doesnt do messages and of my assignments is due in hours 
len ratingone I bet google classroom would be better 
len ratingone Too bad my school district wanted to be the odd one out 
len ratingfour Works great for messaging but I don t always get notifications when they happen 
len ratingfive Bye this app is way better then zoom periodt bye nothing else to say 
len ratingthree There was no sound for seconds that s why I gave star 
len ratingfive Since adopting Teams about months before the pandemic while still using Slack it has come a long way 
len ratingfive It still falls short on performance occasionally and doesn t compare to Slack when it comes to emojis and gifs it s getting more usable 
len ratingfive The video conferencing on this is way above and beyond any others and especially better than WebEx
len ratingthree OK SO I AM A STUDENT AND MY TEACHERS MAKE ME AND MY CLASSMATES USE MICROSOFT TEAMS AND I WAS WANTING TO CHECK ONE OF MY ASSIGNMENTS BUT WHEN I OPEN THE APP ITS SAYS THAT I AM NOT PUT IN A TEAM AND I CANT TURN IN MY WORK AND IM NOT TRYING TO FAILL 
len ratingthree AND IVE BEEN USING TEAMS FOR A WHILE AND THIS HAS HAPPENED NOW 
len ratingfour First things first have a decent computer platform 
len ratingfour I also believe it s part of the Office pay all the time model so it better be worth it 
len ratingfour The chat features are decent but haven t figured out how to group contacts into something useful 
len ratingfour If you use it in a government setting the presenter has to be behind the firewall 
len ratingfour File sharing is an awesome feature the multiple edit function works well so there s that 
len ratingfour Tabs to include outside MS programs such as a KSN SharePoint program or the Huddle File program is convenient 
len ratingfour Pretty good could be better 
len ratingfour This app is good but after I finish doing my assignments it still stays there as if I didn t do it 
len ratingfour It triggers me so much so please fix it 
len ratingfive It changed my life 
len ratingfive At work we use to extensively 
len ratingfive It has increased profitability 
len ratingfive I can t put a on it but i can see that communication is on the spot and projects get complete faster
len ratingfour I use Teams for work daily and it performs well enough most days 
len ratingfour In the past I used the apps version whenever I m on the go and need to take meetings 
len ratingfour These days I jump on the app because the PC version isn t working properly either with choppy connections or audio issue 
len ratingthree When we do our assignments please when the teachers put microsoft forms in the assignments I cannot see half of the questions on my phone so please make ms teams on phone a lot more user friendly
len ratingone Discord good
len ratingfive I d like to be able to post more photos at a time 
len ratingfive Currently the maximum is six 
len ratingfive Good way to collaborate and stay connected in a true teams environment
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingthree The app constantly shows that there are no messages when they re are or erases all previous messages for a short time without me doing so 
len ratingone  basura basura basura basura basura basura basura basura basura basura
len ratingfive  Microsoft Teams great Zoom pretty good Webex awful
len ratingfive Bleh school 
len ratingfive Very Flexible and end to end calls are perfect
len ratingtwo The app works fine but the notification bugs me 
len ratingtwo If I check my notification on my computer or any other device it does not update the app icon until I open up teams on each individual device
len ratingfour I use Teams for work and it s a good product by Microsoft to have group chats and share files via teams 
len ratingfour Video calls is an issue you get audio and video issues all the time 
len ratingfour Larger the group more issues 
len ratingfive I think the MS Teams apple app is very well done 
len ratingfive Very intuitive good layout consistent with the desktop application and ultimately very user friendly 
len ratingone Microsoft teams might as well jump off a cliff with this lag tho they would prob lag back onto the goddamn cliff
len ratingthree Getting the app to work consistently has been a problem 
len ratingthree I use it for school and every day at least one of us can t get into the meeting because the join button won t even show up 
len ratingthree Today that s me and it has happened many other times this semester 
len ratingone I just don t wanna do school
len ratingone Look I use it for school and I liked it because it helped but the lag in meetings is insane like why 
len ratingone Would you like an app that is constantly giving you phantom alerts for messages you already read 
len ratingone Would you like an app that ignores your DND setting 
len ratingone Would you like an app that will notify you an all devices when you re mid conversation on PC despite turning that option off 
len ratingone Would you like an app that refuses to notify you of a message from another organization that you belong to 
len ratingone Then teams is for you 
len ratingfive App works great 
len ratingfive Does all features on iOS quickly and reliably 
len ratingfive No issues with being logged into multiple terminals 
len ratingfive Call quality is Skype 
len ratingfive But the app on desktop needs to be worked over a little more 
len ratingtwo The app is fine but I wish you didn t even get badges during quiet hours 
len ratingfive Love that I can be so connected to my team 
len ratingfive This app keeps me productive on my terms 
len ratingfour I m signed into multiple accounts and constantly get false badge notifications from the background accounts that disappear when I switch to that account and reappear when switching back to my main 
len ratingtwo Before I updated this app I could prevent my phone from ringing when I received a team call 
len ratingtwo However since the update my phone rings whenever I receive a teams call even though I turned off notifications for calls and I am active on my desktop 
len ratingtwo I m about to remove this app solely because of this 
len ratingone too many issues
len ratingthree Desktop application is too heavy for old laptops e g i Gen Memory G
len ratingthree Great product except when it comes to meetings and video streaming it is still buggy compared to zoom 
len ratingfive TEAMS is very useful to stay in touch with all stakeholders and customers 
len ratingone this app won t let you join a meeting ever 
len ratingone it becomes a huge hassle when you need to meet at certain times 
len ratingone the only thing i can find to fix it is un installing and reinstalling the app 
len ratingfour So I m a Studint and I hate school and I do school on this app and if you make this app disappear or not exist anymore maybe I will give it a stars
len ratingfour Teams is awesome except for one aspect that s sharing screens over web meetings 
len ratingfour Still not as smooth as Zoom 
len ratingthree Tried to get in the meeting and installed the app but it just doesn t want to connect 
len ratingthree I tried it on the desktop and it connected but the video and audio on and off buttons keep disappearing and reappearing I don t know why they re not locked in place 
len ratingfive During those hard days Teams seems to me like a best assistant and tool in interacting with my environment
len ratingfive I use this for my current job on this phone app and on my computer 
len ratingfive It s easy and very straightforward to use 
len ratingfive I m glad that I started using this 
len ratingone It is so bad and annoying like just ban it we hate this app it so trash and garbage
len ratingfive I like the teams app because I text with my co workers and create a group text and talk amongst one another about great ideas for the company 
len ratingone It made me go to school
len ratingtwo App was great when I had the option to toggle off incoming calls so they wouldn t ring my phone and it actually worked 
len ratingtwo Now all calls ring my phone 
len ratingtwo I ve reinstalled and ensure call notifications are off 
len ratingtwo I know this is happening for others 
len ratingtwo PLEASE FIX 
len ratingfour I like the option to speak to text in keyboard on mobile 
len ratingfour Need the same option for keyboard on desktop application so I am speak and type 
len ratingone I hate teams because I can not delete a accounts
len ratingone There is Always a glitch in the system meeting takes along time because of bad connections and need to upgrade for colleges students and schools Or its will be better if you separate each level 
len ratingfive Teams provide a tool that is so useful and effective especially during this COVID pandemic 
len ratingfive Very nice app 
len ratingfive User friendly app
len ratingone I dislike this app it does not work for me 
len ratingone Makes me the organizer when I have signed up for a meeting and then I can not get in 
len ratingone On an iPhone functions do not work and I had to totally turn off the phone to get off the call 
len ratingone Now not working well on my computer 
len ratingone No reason why 
len ratingfive Teams should allow users to control how long before status goes to inactive or away Otherwise app is very user friendly 
len ratingone Terrible app gave me depression and anxiety
len ratingfive Teams has made a huge difference for our company 
len ratingfive Thanks to the tight integration with Office setting up events as virtual meetings is simple and reliable 
len ratingfive We use the integrated chat extensively 
len ratingfive Sound and video quality issues seem to be mostly due to wifi at our home offices 
len ratingfive The use of Teams is very easy to use and keeps our team connected 
len ratingfive Also and most importantly it gives us an overview of the days and weeks tasks that need to be met 
len ratingfive Thank you for assisting us 
len ratingfive Danny Ruiz Operations Supervisor FedEx LogisticsMoreno Valley California
len ratingone Camera will not work with iPad 
len ratingone Audio works fine but no camera 
len ratingone Based on what I ve seen online this is a common issue and the only solution is to keep reconnecting until it works 
len ratingone A better solutions is to not bother with this app 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingtwo This app will not open any more
len ratingtwo I ll be on a conference call muted and someone will mention my name so I click to unmute and the unmute button doesn t respond 
len ratingtwo This is been an issue for months are they EVER going to fix it 
len ratingtwo Ok so microsoft teams is an app for working or taking online classes I love this app but I don t like that there are too many updates most of the time my class gets canceled just because teams has too many updates I personally think teams is perfect without having updates 
len ratingtwo I get that u guys have to fix bugs and all that stuff but come on man I hope y all do something about this thank u for taking your time to read this
len ratingfour Yesterday the app would go to initial screen white with blue but would not go past that so I could not log in 
len ratingfour I was able to log in on my iPad though so it wasn t a system wide issue 
len ratingfour Again this morning the app would not work so I deleted and restored it which it says it deletes all info as well 
len ratingfour I was able to get back in Teams after reinstalling the app 
len ratingfive Reminds me of Google Wave 
len ratingfive It was great what Google did so I ll give them some credit 
len ratingfive Microsoft has done an excellent job with this app everything integrates seamlessly 
len ratingfive It is one of the beat collaboration apps that I have used 
len ratingthree Teams could be truly great but the flaws it has are big ones to the right people 
len ratingthree I would say the biggest flaw it suffers from is that when really high level integration and function problems occur or need support their support tram is often just as clueless 
len ratingthree Specifically pertaining to personalized data transportation in VDI ecosystems 
len ratingthree I could go on but frankly I deserve a fruit basket from MS for giving this stars 
len ratingtwo For some reason my iPods don t work when I connect to the Teams app on my phone 
len ratingtwo They always work on everything else that plays a sound on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo How can we fix this 
len ratingtwo Thanks
len ratingfive We can work seamlessly with our team 
len ratingfive Call chats meetings are all working perfectly
len ratingfive This is a great collaborative tool 
len ratingfive It s an amazing app and the amazing thing is that I can connect which my friends through mobile a computer I have tried so many others and none can compare 
len ratingfive when I first tried it I fell in love when I video chat it has such smooth pictures and fast messageing id you read this review get this app NOW it won t waste your time this app made my day 
len ratingone Not sure what changed in previous updates but now my phone is still showing notifications for messages that have been read on laptop
len ratingthree Ok I honestly hate school 
len ratingthree But I think this could use some updates 
len ratingthree First I think you should fix the quality 
len ratingthree Idk if it s my computer or the teachers computer but the quality on the videos are so blurry 
len ratingthree I can t handle it 
len ratingthree Second I think you should add more signs 
len ratingthree Like the little signs you put like the hand smile clapping heart and thumbs up 
len ratingthree Add more 
len ratingthree Like add a toilet so your teacher knows that means your at the bathroom 
len ratingthree Third add a timer for the messages to get deleted 
len ratingthree Like after days the post message has been there then it gets deleted 
len ratingthree This would be good so there s not a bunch of messages posts every where 
len ratingthree And lastly what if you could add a focus button 
len ratingthree Like tap Focus and then the next person you click on the whole screen becomes that person 
len ratingthree  Only on your screen though obviously so we could just see the teachers screen or anybody s screen you want to see 
len ratingthree This could be good cause if you don t want people to have there camera on you can just focus on who you actually want to look at 
len ratingthree This would way more better and I hope you could add these 
len ratingone Signing in does not work and building a profile comes with bugs that won t even allow to to sign in once it s done 
len ratingone I d give zero stars if I could avoid this app 
len ratingone Big mistake 
len ratingone How is someone supposed to see what calendar events they had from the past 
len ratingfive After using Google for most of my business applications I was thrilled to get on Teams and learn of all of its efficiencies 
len ratingfive It s constantly surprising me with tools that help me stay organized easily communicate with our team members invite people to and host meetings store useful docs for reference and more 
len ratingfive With that being said I m still learning about all that has to offer 
len ratingfive Learning about all of the different features and capabilities will take a long time 
len ratingfive Having easy access to training within the app would be welcomed 
len ratingone While the desktop version is fantastic I have yet to be able to connect to a meeting via the app 
len ratingone Every single time I open the app it always says Something went wrong 
len ratingone Please try again later 
len ratingone Calendar meetings and name will not load 
len ratingone I ve tried to access my meetings though the outlook app but that doesn t even work 
len ratingfour Overall it is great but two things prevent me from giving stars 
len ratingfour  key scheduling functionally is behind a pay wall 
len ratingfour Wish I could pay just for teams rather than have to get the whole office bundle pretty big bug when you re going from LinkedIn app to Teams app on iOS when you have more than one profile in Teams 
len ratingfour This is both surprising and not at the same time they are both Microsoft apps so ya 
len ratingthree Chat function is terrible 
len ratingthree Hard to find correct chat 
len ratingthree Hard for people to spot new chat 
len ratingthree Share screen function is ok but still prefer WebEx 
len ratingthree It is pure Microsoft everything is ok 
len ratingthree Nothing is done particularly well 
len ratingthree I have to live with the corporate decision
len ratingfive The funny thing it has features better than that of the Windows app like reply to a message
len ratingone  Guys rate it star so that apple removes this app 
len ratingone Then we won t have to do online school and assignments 
len ratingone WE CAN DO IT
len ratingfive SHARP Professionals use this app 
len ratingfive This is such a great way to contact people in a forward deployed environment 
len ratingfive Army needs to keep AND Allow for use on personal phones as well 
len ratingfive Everything works very well 
len ratingfive The only issue is that you can t reorder your folders when using the mobile app 
len ratingfive Honestly I really can t complain about this application 
len ratingfive Great resource and tool to stay connected with Teams and works well with associated programs and others 
len ratingfive Great application mobile application is great as well 
len ratingfive Over all stars 
len ratingfive Keep up the awesome work guys and gals 
len ratingfive I appreciate it 
len ratingone Really glitchy no
len ratingone  BFAPI s tell us really nothing 
len ratingone App is just the same after update 
len ratingtwo Can you please alphabetically sort contact list on the phone app just like the desktop app 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive Makes my job easier
len ratingfive Keeps my team organized and connected 
len ratingfive Couldn t be more pleased 
len ratingfive Very user friendly 
len ratingfive The background for the video is not easy to initiate 
len ratingfive Words I never thought I d say good job Microsoft
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I can be connected with my team even when I am away from my office 
len ratingfour When I was doing my school meeting the lag was like messing around with my tablet and every time like I go back and refresh the page it just like if roles so please fix this
len ratingone IfI could ve read it to zero stars or negative stars I would have 
len ratingone I have been trying for an hour and a half to get into a conference that I paid for that keeps telling me the meeting is full when it s only at half capacity 
len ratingone This is the absolute worst app I have ever used in my entire life 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Most unproductive productivity program ever 
len ratingtwo Extremely Buggy sometimes asks for microphone but there is no option in settings 
len ratingtwo As well as kicks you out of the meeting every now and then
len ratingfour Have Teams on Phone and computer 
len ratingfour Sometimes access meeting on one or other or sometimes miss meeting hard to clear old meeting reminders on both Teams wants you to join old meetings that are done 
len ratingfour Also it s hard to find a Teams Meeting on Teams even if you re in group or on Team need to find link in Outlook to join or someone needs to send a join request at start of meeting 
len ratingfive If apps were to be in classifications this app would be essential 
len ratingone The app loads slow and once running it makes my phone slow 
len ratingfour Please add whiteboard integration 
len ratingfour When a person starts whiteboard from desktop it is able to be used on iPad in an interactive session to share ideas via drawing on whiteboard 
len ratingfour There is no option to initiate that via iPad 
len ratingfour Please can this be added 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Cumbersome 
len ratingone Incompatible with everything 
len ratingone Making this useful to my job means rebuilding everything about my job just so we can pat ourselves on the back for making the application work 
len ratingone I d rather go to a meeting and get COVID than ever use MS Teams again 
len ratingfive so I wanted to to change my profile picture to adrien from miraculous and then all of sudden I tell my friends to look at it and they can t see it 
len ratingfive So now I am mad because I can t show how cool I am and how cool my profile picture is you need to fix this ASAP 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive User friendly and very useful
len ratingfive Absolutely wonderful collaboration tool and user experience 
len ratingfive Synchronization between desktop and mobile app are amazing and allows me to stay connected on the go 
len ratingone The latest update has stopped me from using Bluetooth headphones during meeting and must have messed with the speakers and mic because now I cause horrible feedback when I am off mute 
len ratingthree Calls are not so good 
len ratingthree Sound quality is poor 
len ratingthree Screen freezes 
len ratingone This app gives me massive diarrhea
len ratingone You will still get notified for calls and chats even with all notifications turned off in iPhone iOS settings 
len ratingone Not okay 
len ratingfour Able to be more responsive and get info faster 
len ratingfour But would like more features as desktop Teams 
len ratingthree very slow and buggy app but is receiving updates that makes it better periodically 
len ratingthree easy to use overall though 
len ratingthree There used to be a very annoying bug where you would join a teams call unmuted even if you selected to join the call muted but as of recent i don t think it has been happening anymore 
len ratingfive Great but on tablets when someone deletes a file then its still there ima rd grader and i use teams for school and i cant find the file for the week cause well THERES A MILLION FILES
len ratingfive Ability to collaborate communicate and create changes in which everyone on the team is involved
len ratingtwo For the longest time this was working just fine but after the last update it completely ignores my quiet times and days off 
len ratingtwo I have also started getting notifications for everything when all I have selected is teams and chat 
len ratingtwo Since this is tied to my work number I have to now I install it so I m not getting random phone calls at AM 
len ratingtwo I guess I ll just have to try again after the next update and hope they fixed it 
len ratingone my teams won t even let me log in 
len ratingone i ve been in it before but i logged out previously and now it won t let me back in 
len ratingfive This is one of the few app that is better in your iphone vs your laptop 
len ratingfive It works pretty well
len ratingone Teams on the pc is ok but the app is horrible 
len ratingone I cannot see any teams chats or contacts 
len ratingone The app just spins looking and looking and looking 
len ratingone Needs to be fixed ASAP 
len ratingfive Would love the ability to access people s outlook calendars and schedule meetings through the TEAMS chats 
len ratingfive One of the best app which I am using daily for office work related collaboration 
len ratingfive Keep rocking Team MS 
len ratingthree This is unavailable marking this platform difficult when I have a company Teams I am un able to communicate with open meetings with other companies unless I am using my person Teams on my phone 
len ratingfive This app is very useful I love it
len ratingtwo I always thought the app worked well but since the most recent update I m not getting my notifications 
len ratingtwo I have to force a refresh for anything to pop up 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingfive Communication is almost always what goes wrong 
len ratingfive Teams helps everyone stay in the know column 
len ratingfive Loving it
len ratingfive Has a great translator tool 
len ratingfive I communicate with my team in China and it works great 
len ratingthree The performance of the app needs work 
len ratingthree I feel like I m always tapping on something and waiting for the app to react 
len ratingthree Only seems to be a mobile problem though 
len ratingthree The other is with plugins 
len ratingthree Seems to be a hit or miss on plugins working properly 
len ratingthree Like I use a remind me plug in on desktop app to remind me to respond to a message sent to me but cannot get it to work on iOS app 
len ratingthree Many times because of bandwidth or just audience mixture we needed the user to dial in to a meeting rather than VoIP 
len ratingfive I love Teams 
len ratingfive I can communicate with friends 
len ratingfive Microsoft keep up the great work 
len ratingfour Good app but need to add the ability to add a virtual background with the app 
len ratingfive This program offers a relief from non stop text inter Team calls and EM by providing an open forum of communication 
len ratingfive It also provides clarity file sharing and up to the minute responses from TEAM members 
len ratingfive Everyone should participate in its usefulness 
len ratingone the worst waste of resources and time very literally caused my laptop to fail and battery to blow up due to taking and mismanagement of resource I would give negative stars I wish I could sue
len ratingthree There is some problem with notifications on this app they never work as expected and keep reverting on their own 
len ratingfive This is a pretty decent way to connect with co workers and continue to get work completed 
len ratingfive Love it it s great
len ratingfive Im surprised at how bug free such a massive application with so many features is 
len ratingfive But Teams consistently works well in ipad and iphone with zero hiccups 
len ratingfive I love being able to use my laptop to share screen and my mobile device as secondary audio 
len ratingfive Great job Microsoft 
len ratingone Everything about this company s subsidiaries is absolutely horrific and doesn t ever work 
len ratingone My Xbox barely works and I can never log in to anything related to Microsoft 
len ratingtwo It keeps freezing so I have to leave the meeting which means I m missing super important information 
len ratingone so i m in my meeting right and everytime i m on it in my phone my screen turns black on and off it s so dumb
len ratingthree It s stops working sometimes
len ratingfour I love this app and use it daily 
len ratingfour Looking to see more consistency in the REPLY feature to a chat 
len ratingfour Sometimes it s there sometimes it s not there available in the same chat or meeting 
len ratingfour The reply to a chat in a meeting helps keep the flow of thought consistent 
len ratingfour Please make it more available and consistent 
len ratingtwo Unstable and unreliable mostly 
len ratingtwo Have never been able to use the mobile app to share a video from my phone 
len ratingtwo Silly stuff like this 
len ratingtwo Ack 
len ratingone NO SCHOOL ANYMORE ARMY
len ratingfour This app is sooooo amazing for meetings 
len ratingfour Very highQuality 
len ratingfour I just love it 
len ratingthree Good to communicate but even though I have all notifications turned on I do not receive notifications of new messages in team chat or posts replies in threads 
len ratingthree Even when the user is muted this app constantly accesses the microphone which iOS shows by displaying the Orange dot 
len ratingthree While Zoom app immediately cuts off accessing microphone as soon as user mutes his microphone 
len ratingone I have Teams ONLY for a college class 
len ratingone All of a sudden I now have to have One Note just to run Teams 
len ratingone NOT cool 
len ratingone Teams stuff shouldn t require extra apps and more downloads and more space just to run it 
len ratingone Put the Class Notebook files back in Teams rather than FORCING everyone to download every Microsoft thing you can cram down our throats 
len ratingfive Good app for work collectively 
len ratingfive  I ve been using this app for classes for school and it s simple and doesn t have an assignment glitch the way google classroom had it works really well but sometimes on my iPad I have to re download it back and forth since sometimes it will not load 
len ratingtwo When used on mobile my screen continually blacks out 
len ratingtwo The amount of times this happens increased if I m in a call but have another application open 
len ratingone Please stop with the pain and suffering It s because of y all I have depression
len ratingone  This made me suffer and I don t recommend this app to anybody it s dog water
len ratingthree Gets the job done in terms of practicality and functionality 
len ratingthree However I have noticed some uncomfortable bugs with this product and similar Microsoft products in general 
len ratingthree It gets the job done but they re it s not as smooth as a product you d expect from tech giants 
len ratingthree The bandwidth for a stable meeting connection is quite high and it s not unusual to experience lags 
len ratingthree Guest functionality is it as great as you d expect 
len ratingthree Marketplace amp integrations are quite basic 
len ratingthree Does not work smoothly with our automating connector zapier 
len ratingthree Great for where we are atm but definitely considering a full switch to Google 
len ratingfive Creo que es mejor que zoom solo dec a 
len ratingone You can t pin a screen on your phone 
len ratingone This is a FAIL 
len ratingone Teams is the worst 
len ratingone Doesn t load past log in screen 
len ratingthree Please limit the amount of times a person needs to log in to use this app 
len ratingthree When I m in a crunch with time it upsets me to log in every time
len ratingfive Really fantastic 
len ratingfive So easy to stay in touch and keep straight all the different topics you have been discussing and collaborating on 
len ratingfive This tool enables the collaboration to live on and retain a history visible to all 
len ratingfive It s really amazingly powerful for people to group together and get things done 
len ratingfive I use it all day all the time I live in it now where I used to live in my email app now it s this 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingtwo Teams is a great app for me to use during digital learning however when I try to change my profile it does not save 
len ratingtwo I have tried at least times logging out refreshing everything I can manage but my profile still changes back to the default initials 
len ratingtwo This has happened fairly a lot of times for me 
len ratingtwo When my friends are in the class sometimes the camera open itself and the mic also opens itself 
len ratingtwo My class mate we re in the class but they aren t they re Please fix this
len ratingone Its bad really bad 
len ratingfive It s really helpful
len ratingfour Hey random person or more likely language processing model 
len ratingfour I ll keep it brief bc I need to get on with my life but I feel the app is well balanced between ease and functionality 
len ratingfour It s good to offer lots of features but the app needs to be an extremely simple tool that s easy to pick and drop as needed 
len ratingfour It costs a little in features but it serves the objective much better 
len ratingfour Well done Microsoft 
len ratingtwo It s ok dumb dawg 
len ratingtwo It is not the greatest bruh 
len ratingone Eww
len ratingfive Since working with this app I am able to communicate effectively with my coworkers and management 
len ratingfive It is easy to get updates and stay connected
len ratingfive This is a wonderful tool and given how fast they are adding new capabilities it would become much more user friendly
len ratingfive I like the intuitiveness of this app 
len ratingfive I like the integration of Outlook and Teams calenders 
len ratingfive It really helps 
len ratingfive I absolutely love teams and the applicability to our organization 
len ratingfive This virtual environment has truly made it difficult for us to be able to still feel together and teams has made it that much easier 
len ratingfive I love having all of our documents together and available to everyone 
len ratingfive Hopefully we can keep it long term because it definitely makes doing our job so much easier especially with reservists 
len ratingfive The Teams App is easy to use and provides the transportability I need to attend meetings anywhere and anytime as well as remain in contact with team members across the country 
len ratingfour  Support for Apple CarPlay is needed 
len ratingthree Some internal apps tabs have limited features 
len ratingthree For instance I have not been able to determine how to view old calendar events from previous weeks 
len ratingfive You can seamlessly transfer calls between Teams on Mobile and Computer 
len ratingfive This is amazing and works so well when you are on the move
len ratingone Takes forever to load very glitchy I hate it for online school just not my thing
len ratingfive I like this app we use it for the company to correspond with each and we are able to share files through out locations 
len ratingfive I truly enjoy this app and hope it comes out with new features and continues to be useful 
len ratingfive Teams is an amazing product and it gets enhanced often 
len ratingfive It bings me innovation in productivity and allows me to spend more face time with customers in a single day 
len ratingfour Most days when I log in Teams is a completely black screen 
len ratingfour I have to run a utility to fix it 
len ratingfour Annoying 
len ratingfour Other than that it is a phenomenal tool 
len ratingfour This app is good with some minor glitches but one of the features which I would like to see is auto disconnect 
len ratingfour Auto disconnect would be used if there is inactivity for one hour 
len ratingfour This would be helpful as sometimes the disconnect feature doesn t work 
len ratingtwo I have used the Teams app year ago 
len ratingtwo At that time I was able to watch again the video recorded on my mobile device everything was fine 
len ratingtwo But now I can t Team Notifications Try downloading the Team notifications on your desktop 
len ratingtwo And I see one thing on the video Expires in days Why 
len ratingtwo I really don t like this 
len ratingtwo Please fix it 
len ratingtwo Thanks
len ratingfour My work has had Teams for a long time but no one really knew how to use it until obstacles forced us to aka COVID 
len ratingfour We now use Teams for all of our meeting and for sharing information and I like it a lot more 
len ratingfour I m giving it stars because I don t think it s the most user friendly app out there it takes a while to get comfortable with the channels and where to find what you need 
len ratingfour Another downside is that you can only have one channel open at one time so you have to jump from one to another when you need two different channels open at once 
len ratingfour Please provide Audio only mode like WebEx App 
len ratingfour  Great app for people who are stuck in isolation with the COVID 
len ratingfour However like Thomas the Walrus people can be on cam 
len ratingfour Don t be shy with that John 
len ratingone  I would delete this garbage app but I have to use it for work 
len ratingone All of a sudden this stupid app requires a phone number 
len ratingone It logged me out because the secondary account I created because my supervisor is an idiot didn t have a phone number attached to it 
len ratingone My main phone number is attached to my original Live account and you cannot use the same phone number for two different accounts 
len ratingone I am deeply offended at being inconvenienced and violated in this way 
len ratingone I hate this app and everyone working for Microsoft 
len ratingthree The app itself was working just fine but there are two HUGE problems 
len ratingthree  At teams meetings the screen will go solid black troughout meetings I had this problem where it won t let me log in 
len ratingthree The only way I have not tried is deleting and redownloading the app and I am just some random person using her mom s phone because I don t have a device
len ratingone i ve had this problem where i can t delete messages i ll click delete yet they will stay in the chat and just won t go away 
len ratingone when i say this i mean in private chats i create with other people like classmates 
len ratingone my saved messages won t work either i press the purple bookmark to un save them but all i have to do is refresh the page and they re back 
len ratingone i think it might be because i deleted those messages and so now they re just stuck in this weird loop 
len ratingone i m confused and i want to be able to use the chat normally again 
len ratingone also sometimes when my teachers are trying to let the students into the meeting it will not show us in the lobby 
len ratingone it s happened twice and it takes time away from our lessons 
len ratingone PLEASE get this fixed 
len ratingone it s so annoying and also i beg of you to add a feature to be able to permanently clear all chats with other people 
len ratingone like private chats that you create 
len ratingone the ones to talk with other students or mutuals 
len ratingone i understand that you could use other platforms but i have some student mutuals who i know only in school and intend to keep it that way so please make that an option 
len ratingone there s lots that needs to be done to fix this app and i m very dissatisfied 
len ratingfive With Teams everything is possible 
len ratingfive Thanks to Teams we were able had an amazing national sales meeting virtually 
len ratingone To make a non intuitive app that you can t even sign up with because your phone number is already taken like what 
len ratingone Recovery process results in an error message 
len ratingone Can t sign up with email apparently 
len ratingone App is bad 
len ratingfive This app to me has been a lifesaver to me as the company I just started working for has gone remote 
len ratingfive I was able to get trained to do my job with the share your screen option amp was able to talk at the same time just as if you re in person getting trained along with our work meetings we all join in via teams 
len ratingfive I definitely recommend getting this app 
len ratingfive My sister was gone on a trip and I got to stay in touch and I do not have a phon so this worked
len ratingfive I love it but the o e problem is the call I need is some times not there so I need to scroll up and up and up but otherwise it s the best I use it a lot not to be mean to zoom but yours is better stars
len ratingone Why have a mute button if it still joins un muted 
len ratingone So infuriating 
len ratingfive Perfect and adaptable toward today s volatile and dynamic business environment
len ratingone I don t like Microsoft they have ugly emoijs aaaahhhh
len ratingone I have to use teams for work so I have it across all my electronics phone iPad Mac 
len ratingone It has been terrible lately on my phone and iPad 
len ratingone I have to delete and download the application every time I want to use it on my phone 
len ratingone I don t have the ability for a quick access to teams 
len ratingone I have to use either my home or office computer in order to logon 
len ratingone It s extremely irritating that I have to delete the app every time I want to use it on my phone 
len ratingthree Every time I go to my camera roll to find a photo it freezes when i scroll 
len ratingthree Please fix
len ratingfive would really like an option to implement my own meeting background photos
len ratingfive If you are in multiple classes this is a good way to stay organized 
len ratingfour I was having an issue with the app not opening on my iPhone 
len ratingfour I deleted and reinstalled the app and it appears to have resolved the issue 
len ratingone Was great 
len ratingone Now it doesn t open anymore 
len ratingone Just a big teams logo before it force closes 
len ratingone Fix this please 
len ratingfour I use my iPad Pro 
len ratingfour Definitely need to add my background 
len ratingfour  So I m on mobile and I can t change my background and can you guys add that but the rest is great
len ratingthree The meeting isn t showing at all no matter how many times I refresh teams it won t show it s getting annoying please fix please
len ratingthree Teams is great 
len ratingthree One thing I m not so fond of is the audio and video quality 
len ratingthree Some of my friends don t have the ability to message me but can on teams and whenever we want to video chat it will get really glitchy 
len ratingthree This app is great and I totally recommend it but please fix this small problem 
len ratingthree Love you Microsoft team 
len ratingfive Working from home with for a large corporation works out well for us because of the teams app 
len ratingfive It is our primary source of communication 
len ratingfive Aside from the monthly zoom calls which we sometimes bypass because group calls on teams do not require a code and it is incredibly user friendly 
len ratingfive The notifications can be too much at times but not because of the app 
len ratingfive It is mainly because of the large corporation thing 
len ratingtwo Remove the ie an other efects
len ratingfour Been using this for nearly everything during the work week including weekends whether it be on mobile or PC 
len ratingfour Recently though the mobile version for iPad has been freezing to the point that I have to delete then reinstall just have access to it for that day 
len ratingfour It gets tiring as this platform is critical to the daily function and coordination of work staff 
len ratingfour Please find out what is causing this reoccurring issue 
len ratingfive i have an idea 
len ratingfive could you make it so we can put our camera on only for our teacher to see not our class mates 
len ratingone First of all they can find your home if you download it second thing the cameras why that s creepy can t you just talk it looks kid friendly when it s not and the calender isn t it creepy how they now what time your meeting is coming on it s bad app I recommend not to download this pls if you have it delete it
len ratingfive After using webex Skype slack Jabber finally found what I was looking for in a smooth easy to use app
len ratingtwo Nice features 
len ratingtwo There is one giant reason for not wanting to use it 
len ratingtwo The notification tones are forgettable and soft 
len ratingtwo Cannot be changed to anything that can truly notify you 
len ratingtwo So it s for jobs that have no urgency to notification 
len ratingtwo My Airpods are connected to my iPad Pro but Teams won t recognize the connection and only work through speakers 
len ratingtwo There is no option to do anything if in middle of video conference other then drop and rejoin 
len ratingfour It s a good app the only problem I have is when I m in a meeting and need to chat I have to leave the meeting
len ratingfive Great tool
len ratingone I currently cannot access Teams from my iPhone 
len ratingone The app will only open to the opening screen with logo and freeze there 
len ratingone What is the problem 
len ratingtwo So the app generally works completely fine for a day the next day when I go to login the app will not load 
len ratingtwo It times out and takes me to my iPhone Home Screen 
len ratingtwo I delete the app download it again and it works fine for the day 
len ratingtwo It is pretty annoying 
len ratingfour To get stars all you have to do is make it to where you can delete old chats 
len ratingfour I enjoy every other aspect of Teams 
len ratingfive Awesome app easy to use
len ratingfive I could not see shared documents or PowerPoint on iPad my screen 
len ratingfive What do I need to do 
len ratingone Integrates seamlessly with the desktop app but it doesn t share the profile pic between them 
len ratingone It s awful I never can call anyone of my classmates alone and it makes me sign in ALL the time and even when I do it still doesn t let me it never even lets me change my name so yeah I don t like it 
len ratingfive  In my bed I was doing school once I joined I was skinny and I flipped I freaked out and my bedroom was dark I closed my cam and opened it up again and it was normal FIVE STARS 
len ratingthree The sharing features are amazing with include sound and access control but what about an ipad 
len ratingthree Or android 
len ratingthree I mean why does in zoom you can share sound on ipad but not in teams at least add share sound please this would really help in teams 
len ratingfive It runs my life 
len ratingfour Over the weeks I ve had to uninstall amp reinstall the app to access it 
len ratingfour No issue for a desktop
len ratingthree  It has been crashing and not opening
len ratingfive I think this ap is a great way to keep up with my coworkers 
len ratingone please do not get this app it s so glitchy and when you mute yourself the person who s in control teacher ect 
len ratingone can still hear you 
len ratingfour Add audio sharing option for ios and android 
len ratingfour NOW 
len ratingfour other than that it s fine i guess
len ratingone No me dejan comer en clase 
len ratingone Just no they said no more video calling
len ratingone I can t submit my assignments and homework anymore on my phone because Teams crashes every single time I open it after loading for about seconds on IOS please fix this 
len ratingone I d give it around a star if it really worked but I can t use it 
len ratingone Seems like I m not alone in my issues since the last update 
len ratingone App constantly freezes when I attempt to open in the morning 
len ratingone Only solution is to delete and reinstall the app EVERY DAY 
len ratingone So frustrating 
len ratingone Please PLEASE troubleshoot and fix this issue 
len ratingthree I honestly don t know why this app has such a high rating 
len ratingthree I mean it does have lots of handy features don t get me wrong 
len ratingthree But come on 
len ratingthree This thing is SO SLOW 
len ratingthree I end up sending messages twice often because of how slow it is to update and show that i ve sent the message 
len ratingthree Due to circumstances I am unable to use Webex Teams so I resorted to this app solely on its high rating but from what i ve seen i don t think it deserves stars 
len ratingfour Video meetings need a call in number like Zoom for hearing impaired persons who use a phone that Bluetooth pairs to their hearing aids
len ratingone You have put Non sense restriction of ioS and restricted millions of people who cannot upgrade their iOS to and hence cannot use this pretty useful teams
len ratingfive The app is excellent but I wish the app would follow my phone s color scheme i e auto switch from light to dark when my phone does 
len ratingfive This app has helped me so much with school
len ratingone It use to work fine now it won t open 
len ratingfour It s great except for the constant resigning in
len ratingfour  When i m open team my task bar change 
len ratingfour I m join a meeting I can t open cam
len ratingone Buggy iPad version in this update 
len ratingone Crashed on exit 
len ratingone No active mic view available now 
len ratingone Really a second rate piece of software engineering 
len ratingone Garbage
len ratingfive The team app is easy to work with and gives you excellent connectivity and communications in a mobile environment
len ratingfive Please add O email capability to teams 
len ratingfour Keyboard in chat function comes up at a whim and unreliable 
len ratingfour Another bug to fix 
len ratingone Ever since I installed latest update the app freezes on load up every time I have to load the app 
len ratingone I have to delete and reinstall Teams every time I have to reauthenticate which is once per day 
len ratingone Please fix this then I give it stars 
len ratingone I hate this app because i hate school 
len ratingone  It would not let me join a meeting and I am online for school in Nashville so if you miss a ton of school you can go to jail
len ratingfive Unless it comes to performance up time awesome integrations knowledge preservation pace of new feature roll out 
len ratingfive Welcome to another case of Microsoft destroying the competition when Silicon Valley tries to reinvent the wheel and creates new problems that they previous generations solved efficiently 
len ratingfive Oh by the way Teams uses are online when AWS goes down 
len ratingone I have to delete it and download it every morning to make it work 
len ratingone Every morning it gives me a blank screen
len ratingone Everyday I have to delete it then reinstall
len ratingone I m not sure what s going on with the latest update but every single morning I have to delete the app and reinstall then re login 
len ratingone Extremely frustrating and time consuming
len ratingfour  App needs update 
len ratingfour Since updating to IOS I ve needed to delete and reinstall app DAILY to use 
len ratingone  If phones don t belong in school than school shouldn t be allowed on phones 
len ratingfive This app has helped me stay connected to my team via chat calls video conferences and calendar updates 
len ratingfive Syncing Teams on all my devices has freed me up to work remotely so much easier than ever before 
len ratingone When I got the update I have to delete the app everyday and reinstall it just to log into the app 
len ratingone They took a great dependable app and ruined it 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP 
len ratingfour  I m doing school
len ratingfive Teams got my business winning
len ratingone Teams does something with the sound picked up by the microphone in the iPad or AirPods 
len ratingone Others can t hear me well 
len ratingone This does not happen when i dial in by phone or in FaceTime or Zoom 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive Hoping this tool becomes really healthful in our community 
len ratingfour Would be a star but I hate that it sends you an email about the chats amp you can t turn those off other than that hella sick
len ratingone It s like Gabi from atack on titan everybody hates Gabi from atack on titan 
len ratingfive A company shouldn t be without it 
len ratingtwo Be aware that this app does not implement the full functionality of its Windows version 
len ratingtwo In particular it does not let you delete posted files 
len ratingfive I m not sure how much this costs for our company but it s worth every penny 
len ratingfive Syncs effortlessly across multiple platforms and can be used with ease for both internal and external contacts 
len ratingfour I m on my phone and I can t sign in for school and I want this bug fixed asap
len ratingone We currently use MS Teams as the only approved form of video conference that I m allowed to use at my company 
len ratingone For the last two weeks I have to uninstall and reinstall the program daily for it to work on my phone 
len ratingone If I wasn t REQUIRED to use this app I would not be using it at all 
len ratingtwo App worked well for the first two months 
len ratingtwo For the last two weeks it freezes and I have to delete it and reinstall for it to work 
len ratingtwo Oddly Teams App only works for the day and locks up the next day 
len ratingtwo The only work around has been to delete app and reinstall 
len ratingtwo This started about 
len ratingtwo Before that Teams has worked without issue since June 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingthree I use Teams for business meetings and to teach and it s one of the easiest programs at there 
len ratingthree However when you share the screen you can t see the chat or those who are using the raise hand mechanism 
len ratingthree This means I have to broadcast from one device while having another device to the side to see the chat 
len ratingthree Also there is still no way to add a background unless you are on a laptop desktop 
len ratingthree Many individuals broadcast from tablets or iPads and the capability of being able to add a background to those devices would increase ease and accessibility 
len ratingfour Love the interaction files connected and ease of use but you can t have docs open at the same tone unless you open them on the desktop and then need to make sure to download and save 
len ratingfour Seems like something they could adapt easily to have multiple teams channels and docs open simultaneously 
len ratingtwo They should put a system to privately mute calls to students as many leave the microphone open and it is tedious 
len ratingtwo App won t open been happening about a week now 
len ratingtwo I have to remove it and reinstall it for it to open 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating since I use it on a daily basis 
len ratingone App requires frequent re installs and clearing of data to maintain functionality since recent updates 
len ratingone Need to address these stability issues 
len ratingone Like so many other people have stated before me there is some sort of bug that prevents you from opening the app more than once without uninstalling and reinstalling it 
len ratingone Please resolve this issue ASAP as this app is required for my job 
len ratingone App freezes every morning when I am supposed to login with CVR account 
len ratingone I have to delete the app from my iOS device every hours 
len ratingone Evidently Microsoft thinks they can get companies to use their Authenticator by forcing download and blocking Gemalto 
len ratingone Wrong move 
len ratingone We can dump Teams mobile 
len ratingone Easy choice given how weak Teams is overall 
len ratingfive First Post Teams still won t open iPhone Pro 
len ratingfive Need this application fixed soon or I ll be forced to transition my office communications to another platform 
len ratingfive Was very reliable before latest update 
len ratingfive UPDATE Deleted Teams 
len ratingfive Did a HARD RESET Google instructions of my iPhone Pro 
len ratingfive Then reinstalled Teams 
len ratingfive It s now opening 
len ratingone Worst app on my iPhone 
len ratingone Constantly crashing 
len ratingone I tried to login into my personal teams and really irritating by asking frequent setups 
len ratingone I m able to login into my existing account with phone no and not allowing me login into my laptop and it s asking to setup again and again 
len ratingone When I tried to setup my new email it is asking to use diff email this email is already exist 
len ratingone With existing one one it is not allowing me to login 
len ratingone Not at all user friendly app 
len ratingone I ll give minus for this application 
len ratingone Not even qualified for zero 
len ratingfour Love teams my only qualm is that sometimes the video call does not work when splitting screen and often times the space keys DOES NOT work 
len ratingfive I like the flexibility of the Teams App for the ability to chat individually or as a group 
len ratingfive This combined with meeting invites etc make this a very powerful tool 
len ratingfive Unfortunately recently we have had issues with it freezing up 
len ratingfive Fix that issue and we have a win 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingone And yes it s been updated 
len ratingone I have had zero issues with this app until this week 
len ratingone I resorted to uninstalling and reinstalling the app yesterday to get it to work but today it is back to not opening 
len ratingone I ve had this app for almost a year and has been working fine but since last week the login page is frozen and then the app force closes 
len ratingone I am no longer able to open it from my iphone or even off of Microsoft Edge 
len ratingone Very frustrating and annoying when you use this app all the time 
len ratingone Please get it fixed 
len ratingone I don t know what has happened over the past week but I have had to remove and reinstall MS Teams each day to use its services 
len ratingone My company uses Microsoft Authenticator for added security before allowing access to our corporate systems 
len ratingone Idk if that is the reason for the constant crashing of the app but after I use it for about an hour the app will not open for me again 
len ratingfour This app is great don t get me wrong but it stopped showing me my notifications a few days ago 
len ratingfour I haven t been able to see when i get new assignments or when my teacher posts something on the general page 
len ratingfour I went to my settings and saw that notifications were turned on so this is now an issue on teams 
len ratingfour Microsoft please help 
len ratingone Its a TERRIBLE app whenever I try to enter a meeting I have to wait and that makes me late 
len ratingone And when it doesn t connect it asks me to rate the app SO here I am 
len ratingone It has terrible organization and its overall terrible terrible 
len ratingone Dont get this its a waste of storage 
len ratingone Last few weeks I can get it to open at all
len ratingtwo I don t know what happened but ever since the beginning of February this app has been having a lot of trouble 
len ratingtwo Examples are like not logging in even after you enter your password app not loading and even crashing 
len ratingtwo I ended up deleting and reinstalling the app and that did not do anything 
len ratingtwo My experience might be on the extreme side but it s extremely frustrating when I know I m unable to answer Teams calls or attend meetings with my phone 
len ratingtwo I end up using the PC version of Teams and even then it s sometimes troubling to even use it due to some of the persistent trouble like not being able to login 
len ratingone The app used to work great but recently it freezes up every morning when trying to open it 
len ratingone I Have to Delete and Reinstall every day in order for it to work until the next morning 
len ratingone Pain in the tail 
len ratingone When you install it it will work fine for a day 
len ratingone But the next day it will get stuck on the logo loading screen and not let you log in 
len ratingone The only fix is to uninstall and download install the whole app again 
len ratingone Just crashes now and won t even open 
len ratingone Been like this for weeks 
len ratingthree Not loading I need to work
len ratingone Stupid
len ratingone It gets too locked I thought I was playing frefire
len ratingfive Teams is so easy to use and one of the best
len ratingfive This app is great but there s one problem 
len ratingfive Sometimes I get removed from a meeting but it doesn t say who did it 
len ratingfive Can you just add a feature that tells someone who removed them it would just be more convenient 
len ratingone  nadalh
len ratingone I don t puke school 
len ratingone I ever will 
len ratingthree Nice program but I don t understand why it will not allow me to call outside of work 
len ratingthree I still have to use Skype to call my supplier s 
len ratingthree The file application does seem to be a strong part of the program 
len ratingfive Super easy to get live updates from the team without having to hop behind the computer every time 
len ratingtwo Love this phone app as it pairs well with my computer app and has all the same functions 
len ratingtwo BUT new upgrade version leaves calls ringing on phone for hours until I decline even if I answered and have the call on the computer 
len ratingtwo When I do answer on phone it doesn t connect video or audio 
len ratingtwo Bug needs fixed ASAP 
len ratingone The app keeps crashing 
len ratingone I have to delete and reinstall the app every single time I want to use the app 
len ratingone My job uses Teams to communicate and this app make that difficult if I m away from my computer 
len ratingthree It lacks the functionality to send an IM to one person only on a Teams call with multiple people 
len ratingone I have to one star this app because I can t get it to open more than once without having to reinstall 
len ratingone When I do get in after a fresh install it s clunky to maneuver around in zero intuitive flow 
len ratingone This program needs a major overhaul to fix even the most basic of functionality 
len ratingone The latest update won t load on iOS iPads anymore unless you delete the app and reinstall it 
len ratingone Every day 
len ratingone This is a royal pain in the backside as now I have to do this every morning 
len ratingone This has been going on for weeks now 
len ratingone It s frustrating as I need this for work 
len ratingone So I only give the app star at this time 
len ratingone Just like a few others have mentioned 
len ratingone Lately all of a sudden I ve had to delete and reinstall the app a few times to get it work again 
len ratingone Without that it just stays idling in the Teams splash screen when I try opening it 
len ratingone Bog vas ne ubio dje izmisliste ovo
len ratingone Since Feb the app crashes every day and I have to keep deleting and re downloading the app 
len ratingone I also used to get notifications but I no longer do even though all of my notifications are on 
len ratingone This is extremely frustrating since I have to use it for work every day and I cant bring my laptop with me everywhere I go 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS MICROSOFT 
len ratingone iPhone Pro Max 
len ratingone App crashes at launch and the only solution is to delete the app and reinstall 
len ratingone Awful 
len ratingone I hate this app it s annoying 
len ratingfour Cuesta un poco unirse a una reuni n iniciada 
len ratingfour Se debe mejorar este punto en el App Mobile 
len ratingfour Por lo dem s excelente
len ratingfive Teams allows the communication between staff feel fun like a social media platform 
len ratingfive The anticipation isn t dreadful 
len ratingfive More apt to check and communicate back 
len ratingone School is gross
len ratingfive Best app to keep updated about work related information without them having your cell phone number 
len ratingtwo I love the office suite but I think since the last update it s stopped loading completely 
len ratingtwo Maybe it s just me but even after searching help topics I cannot figure out how to have teams in my phone and desktop without it defaulting to my phone being the primary 
len ratingtwo When it s downloaded onto my phone it only rings on my Phone not my mac computer 
len ratingtwo I have to keep removing it all the time 
len ratingtwo It s just annoying and not great user experience
len ratingtwo I am not able to download videos either in my Karoo and phone
len ratingtwo  Since few days ago this app didn t work like before 
len ratingtwo It needs to be deleted and reinstalled to use everyday 
len ratingtwo Can someone fix this issue 
len ratingone I can no longer use this app unless I delete it and reinstall it 
len ratingone It is getting really annoying to do that every time there is a call 
len ratingone It used to be a five star app now it is just a hunk of junk 
len ratingone Not sure why this is happening but I hope they fix it 
len ratingtwo I have a y o who has to use this app daily for his school 
len ratingtwo They teach through the app 
len ratingtwo Which is great except when it doesn t work as it should on iPad 
len ratingtwo I am disappointed 
len ratingtwo I prefer that he uses an iPad since it s takes up less space on his little desk that he uses for school 
len ratingtwo But this app doesn t work well enough for something that should be pretty easy to do 
len ratingfour Muy buena 
len ratingtwo You have always needed to log in daily on the app not a big deal 
len ratingtwo But Since I have had to delete then reinstall the app to login 
len ratingtwo Once I login the app is fine for hrs then I have to reinstall is again 
len ratingtwo Kind of annoying
len ratingone This app is amazing and I am studying in it and all but the main problem is that the assignment tab for my IOS is missing 
len ratingone My teachers keep sending assignments there and the tab itself isn t there 
len ratingone What s going on 
len ratingone I need the tab so I can get marks from there too 
len ratingone Creators of Microsoft Teams you need to work on this issue like right now or maybe kids or tweens or teens might lose their marks when they tried to attempt an assignment 
len ratingone This is a problem on my IOS so can you please fix it 
len ratingfive Once you get in it is pretty easy to navigate 
len ratingone I ve been using this app for my work for the last months but for the last days the app is not opening on my phone unless o delete it and redownload it 
len ratingone Please fix this issue ASAP
len ratingfour The app is great one can even slide to reply the message 
len ratingfour Biggest fault I have recently noticed is that even if I sign out of my account I will still receive notifications is there an update for this fault or do I have to re install the app 
len ratingthree It s 
len ratingthree Callkit came out years ago and Skype for business has it why doesn t teams 
len ratingthree If you want people to use teams for all business voice meetings and chat let s make this the most productive app and integrate call kit 
len ratingthree I should not have to write a review to get this on your radar 
len ratingfour At times there is poor audio quality and there is feedback echo on the call 
len ratingfour I am hoping that can be improved upon 
len ratingone  to battery in hours 
len ratingone  used by teams 
len ratingone I used teams for about minutes today 
len ratingone Trash app 
len ratingfive I ve tried a lot of different platforms 
len ratingfive Teams is my favorite by far 
len ratingfive TEAMS has quickly become the most simplistic method of remote meetings I have ever needed 
len ratingfive Even a year old non tech guy can do something with TEAMS 
len ratingfive Thanks for making this easy 
len ratingone The app is ungodly slow it won t let me open half the time or it force closes 
len ratingfive I don t want to have everyone s personal cell numbers and I don t want them to have mine 
len ratingfive iPhone group messages are a joke 
len ratingfive I most use this app as a replacement for quick text communication with the chat feature 
len ratingfive So helpful helps keep things professional 
len ratingtwo I get it that accessibility is important in any design 
len ratingtwo And I noticed that no matter what orientation I use teams on the video on off is close to my one of my fingers 
len ratingtwo This might be intended 
len ratingtwo However I live in horror every time I m in no video meeting 
len ratingtwo Otherwise the best communication app and I will update this stars review soon 
len ratingfour I have an iPhone X and I have noticed that I have to delete and reload the app every day in order to use teams 
len ratingfour For some reason the app hangs on the introductory screen with the teams logo and stays there 
len ratingfour The app is great if it works 
len ratingthree Updated to the latest version open the app frozen 
len ratingthree Deleted and reinstalled first it s working then it is frozen again when you switched to other apps and try to open Teams again 
len ratingfive I really enjoy using this app 
len ratingfive It s well optimized and easy to use and has a lot of convenient features to make work really productive
len ratingfive I love the app but just wish you could delete conversations 
len ratingfive Please consider
len ratingtwo an ok tool for collaboration but recently its been very buggy not showing meeting names in channels not allowing people to join meetings instead showing them as ended 
len ratingtwo not microsofts best work
len ratingone Since last week I have to delete ans reinstall daily 
len ratingone On an iPhone with most up to date iOS
len ratingtwo In the last week the Teams app has begun to regularly crash and then completely lock up when it is restarted 
len ratingtwo Installed on an iPhone Pro running iOS 
len ratingtwo My current clunky fix is to delete the app reinstall and that will usually get it running for the rest of the day 
len ratingtwo Then after long periods being idle generally overnight the app crashes on first use in the morning 
len ratingtwo Otherwise prior to this recent period the app and its features have been excellent 
len ratingone All of a sudden over the past week when files are uploaded in our Team Channels you cannot view them 
len ratingone This is only viewable on the desktop now which is crazy 
len ratingone A good amount of people use their smart phones for this app this needs to be fixed 
len ratingone Of someone uploads a file we must be able to view the most recent file 
len ratingone Instead it s constantly stuck showing me files from and meanwhile it s Feb 
len ratingone After updating the app the most recent time it won t even open for me now 
len ratingone I uninstalled and reinstalled the app once and it worked but then after the first time went right back to not working 
len ratingone I tap on the app to open it and the logo just stays on the screen for a while until the app crashes 
len ratingfour Since recent update was installed iPad application started to freeze on startup 
len ratingfour Please fix 
len ratingfour Overall good application 
len ratingthree Teams is very good for online meetings 
len ratingthree Call Quality is good even with low internet speeds bandwidth 
len ratingthree But it has too many features integrated into it which requires lot of training for end user 
len ratingthree There should be a basic app with few critical features amp other features should be in enabled thru user settings 
len ratingthree It s very easy to use Zoom or WhatsApp for a group call which can be used by anyone without any prior knowledge 
len ratingfive Great functions love the platform 
len ratingfive  I LOVE teams it s my most used app 
len ratingfive There s nothing I don t like about it and this app really helps knowing I m in school this is the best way for contacting friends too 
len ratingfive This app is really useful for school like kids in elementary college middle school and high school you can turn in work easy and fast 
len ratingfive I also love that you can do group calls with friends snap other people so this is why I give it a five star rating 
len ratingone App no longer works 
len ratingone Each day I have too delete and reload
len ratingone First of all onetime it said my camera was off and my teacher said it was on the whole time 
len ratingone Even when I put my mic off when I join the meeting it s on and this happens every time 
len ratingone When I m trying to take a test and be in class at the same time it exits me out of the meeting 
len ratingone In conclusion i really hate this app and wish I wasn t forced to use it almost every day
len ratingfive This app is just amazing
len ratingfive Can you make it so on iso you can go into a different app with camera on
len ratingone Teams is so bad compared to skype 
len ratingone It freezes every time I try to type out a sentence to my team 
len ratingone The screen share function is horrific 
len ratingone I can no longer take control of an employees screen like I could through Skype 
len ratingone My company changing from Skype to Teams has been the worst thing to happen in and I will never forgive them 
len ratingone FIX YOUR APP MICROSOFT IM SO SICK OF YOUR MONOPOLY 
len ratingone it is so bad and laggy this keeps my school alive I HATE it so much it ruins mental health and it s ghetto
len ratingthree iOS new iPhone At least yesterday I was able to delete app on phone and reload from App Store 
len ratingthree Only option in App Store is to open Not a good option because TEAMS still frozen 
len ratingthree Yea 
len ratingone The app wont load after the last update
len ratingone  As of February the app will not get past the load screen 
len ratingone No tech support options I hope they fix this bug soon as my office has come to rely on Teams to enable remote work 
len ratingone Will not open after recent update 
len ratingtwo Why did you take away the ability to display previews of messages in notifications 
len ratingone Have to reinstall every day because won t open 
len ratingone I use it everyday as part of my job 
len ratingone Since Monday FEB it has frozen and crashed everyday 
len ratingone I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and then it works fine 
len ratingone I m forced to write this bad review because Microsoft has zero customer support 
len ratingone I went through the phone number which led me to a website 
len ratingone Went through the bot assistant which is worthless and it said click here to talk to a real person I thought Great 
len ratingone Now I can get a trouble ticket in with the company I was very disappointed when it sent me to their public online forum that they even warn you could have scammers posing as agents 
len ratingone This is extremely frustrating and I have given up 
len ratingone Once Microsoft fixes the bugs with their app I will change my review 
len ratingone This is making me wonder why I pay a yearly subscription to Office though especially since it used to be that you could just outright buy the Office software suite and you had better support where you could talk to a live person 
len ratingone Where is all of my money going Microsoft if it s not going to take care of your customers 
len ratingfive Teams app has many aspects and the more I navigate it the more I find a need to learn 
len ratingfive This is in a good way 
len ratingfive It s learning to make the task better easier and more efficient 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone This is broken we can t take photos and I need for my class this broken and it s not my internet please fix this it s broken I can t take photo and I need for my class please fix this
len ratingfour I was going to give stars but I left because I can t make a team 
len ratingfour I am on my personal account 
len ratingfour I m on mobile 
len ratingfour And it s kindof annoying 
len ratingthree Why do I have to sign in a billion times 
len ratingthree Why 
len ratingone It s dumb I wish it was never a thing 
len ratingone I literally lost GB of my storage cuz of this bad dumb trash app 
len ratingone I bet everyone who said this is good cuz they either live in the US or have good internet 
len ratingone I hate this app with SO MUCH passion 
len ratingone I was just trying to watch the recording for class on my phone and when try to pause it and write down the answers 
len ratingone Teams been freezing on me and it s not responding on what I to and it just freeze while I m hearing the teacher talk at the same time but I can t pass the vid since it kept freezing 
len ratingone Fix ur all
len ratingfour Having problems when I change to a different screen when sharing
len ratingfour Along with the rest of the world I ve been home working and the Teams app always keeps me connected when I need to be 
len ratingfour The most recent updates are way better than when it was first released and the interface all in all is a GREAT replacement for Skype for Business 
len ratingfour Everything in one place I just need Outlook interlooped perfect 
len ratingone Since the iOS update can t open the app anymore 
len ratingone When I click the app it tries to load but fails 
len ratingone Please fix this as I need this for work 
len ratingone Was great before last update 
len ratingone Too limited in features vs desktop version still incredibly NOT user friendly 
len ratingone Dear MS you clearly need a Mac vax As in years ago 
len ratingone  This app is awful 
len ratingone You can access the files for your class without leaving unmuting has a second lag and YOU COME IN CLASS UNMUTED 
len ratingone NO
len ratingtwo  This app lacks a calendar view it just shows you a list of upcoming meetings 
len ratingtwo If you have multiple meetings in a time slot it just shows a poorly ordered list giving no indication they start at the same time 
len ratingtwo Do you want to view yesterday s meetings 
len ratingtwo You can t 
len ratingtwo Do you want to be reminded that a meeting is starting 
len ratingtwo This app does not have reliable notifications 
len ratingtwo  You cannot Teams call somebody and share your screen at the same time 
len ratingtwo It works for a Teams meeting but not a Teams call 
len ratingtwo As soon as you share your screen the audio drops as soon as you reconnect audio the screenshare stops 
len ratingtwo  percent of the time you cannot see a Teams call from your lockscreen 
len ratingtwo When somebody is screensharing you cannot lock your phone so the screenshare stops using tons of battery data while still being able to mute unmute 
len ratingtwo All other video chat apps I ve used handle this fine 
len ratingtwo  This app shows the last names of the people on your call and does not show first names 
len ratingtwo All you want is first names 
len ratingtwo It shows you everything you don t want to see and nothing you do want to see 
len ratingtwo  The video call button is way too close to the bottom left corner of the app so people constantly accidentally press it 
len ratingtwo Having this happen at the wrong time could cost you your job 
len ratingtwo  As a safeguard you can disable camera access in Settings gt Teams gt Camera however it will immediately drop your Teams call 
len ratingtwo If you need to share video and re enable it it will drop your Teams call again 
len ratingone keeps disconnecting when desktop and mobile are connected to meeting at same time
len ratingthree  Teams overall works pretty well on my Dell laptop but on my Apple iPhone it seems to crash a lot during meetings but me out I have to constantly log back in and then just get booted back out it looks like it s changing some thing with the ringer volume or something with the volume is getting tripped up because it s showing there s a change in the volume ringer when it crashes even though I didn t push any buttons 
len ratingthree Kind of odd 
len ratingfour  Microsoft should add the ability for picture in picture on teams
len ratingfive My teams app hasn t been working for the last week and I noticed a few others in these reviews had the same issue 
len ratingfive Finally after uninstalling re installing restarting my phone etc I went into the settings for the app and activated the Clear data option 
len ratingfive Close out teams and reopen then enter your info back in and it should work again 
len ratingfive Did for me 
len ratingfive Hope this helps others 
len ratingone The app is great to use however if you accidentally click allow organization to manage your device you can t reverse it 
len ratingone Which I think a huge red flag 
len ratingone I need to have this option turned off on my personal phone 
len ratingone I m not sure if my phone will be hacked or not 
len ratingone And I can t get ahold of anyone who can help me at Microsoft 
len ratingone Everything is a virtual assistance 
len ratingone I need to speak to a real person 
len ratingone Because now my phone has been compromised and I am so upset 
len ratingone So please use the app at your own risk 
len ratingone You have been warned 
len ratingone The calendar tab has disappeared after the latest update 
len ratingone Horrendous 
len ratingone How am I dialling into meetings from with in the app now 
len ratingthree Hopefully this app works for our needs 
len ratingthree Trying to figure out learn app 
len ratingthree Not sure how it would work for group meetings or how we all get notified when a important message is relayed 
len ratingtwo Doesn t work now with Apples latest software update
len ratingfive I helped me do thing and see people I know from the olean center and relay for life team meeting
len ratingone Using teams at work or at all reminds me of using windows 
len ratingone Nearly everything is broken it s insecure can t even get fa to work on Linux 
len ratingone  it s ui is horrible and distracting it s making feature parity with modern workplace tools and it s overall ux is confusing and disorienting 
len ratingone The absolute worst decision my company has ever made was using Teams and Office at work 
len ratingone As a technology professional with decades of consulting experience I strongly advise against using Teams for any reason 
len ratingfour Good app 
len ratingfour But memory footprint is too large 
len ratingfive Je veux chang la langue des sous titres du anglais au fran ais 
len ratingfive S il vous pla t je veux une r ponse 
len ratingfour The problem that its used for online classes 
len ratingfour And for me online classes are the worst like teachers are acting like they never wanted to be in the online class and their teaching skills not all the teachers are bad some of them are good 
len ratingtwo Not a huge fan because if I am idol while reading something it logs me out or shows that I am away when I am not 
len ratingtwo Need to be able to adjust it 
len ratingthree So when my client upload something in files about an hour ago I don t see the file even after I refresh the tab
len ratingone I have no clue why schools continue to use this app 
len ratingone It is slow and in every class there s at least one person who has an issue joining a meeting 
len ratingone There s also the issue of meetings not appearing sometimes the purple camera icon appears but when I tap it and it enters the channel and chat there is no meeting there nor is there a join button 
len ratingone Microsoft apps are always heavy and slow 
len ratingone Everything takes too long to load and this also applies to the computer versions of the apps 
len ratingone TEAMS is not an exception 
len ratingone It is slow clunky and I really don t get why my school can t use something else 
len ratingone Not worth even the one star I m forced to give it 
len ratingone Literally I have never had one problem with Zoom 
len ratingone Name one Microsoft app or desktop program and there s always a problem 
len ratingone If I could delete it I would but I m forced to keep it 
len ratingfour I m just here cause of school 
len ratingfour The only thing I find wrong with this is the teachers 
len ratingone MS teams started bugging out on February th not getting past the loading screen 
len ratingone Uninstalled and re installed to fix the issue 
len ratingone February th same issue again freezing at loading screen 
len ratingone Trying to get to app support after signing in online shows I m in line for live chat but if I switch out from the screen I can lose my place Really Microsoft 
len ratingone I know you re one of the largest companies in the world but you guys have really sub par customer service 
len ratingone No email didn t get a call option no hassle Free customer service you guys can really take a page from apple or PayPal on customer service at least I could leave a message with them and they will get back to me when possible without me having to tie up my phone computer and wait for support 
len ratingone We can t delete the messages whyyyyy whhyyy 
len ratingone Following the update to new iOS teams is no longer operating in phone not even open 
len ratingone I m a huge fan of Teams across several platforms 
len ratingone Unfortunately since I updated to iOS yesterday my Teams won t open 
len ratingone It gets stuck before bringing up the sign in page and then quits 
len ratingone Any suggestions 
len ratingone On iPhone XR iOS and the app stopped working 
len ratingone Gets stuck on the opening screen 
len ratingone Have to delete and re download to make it work again 
len ratingone Crappy service and connection 
len ratingone Tells me that my video is off but it isn t 
len ratingone the fact that this use and more of my cpu is weird
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingone If it opens it crashes after the splash screen 
len ratingfive Teams was working great until today when the app won t open 
len ratingfive It keeps me connected with my team super helpful engagement tool 
len ratingfive Working virtually with the TEAMS APP is AWESOME 
len ratingone I hate this app because it removes random people
len ratingfive So i love this app I use it for school on my iPad the only thing is that I think my camera turns off when I go into another app such as word 
len ratingfive My teacher has a strict rule that your camera has to be on all day in fact my whole school does and when we do an assignment together my camera turns off I think 
len ratingfive Plz fix and thx in advance 
len ratingone It has worked fine up until the latest update 
len ratingone Now it doesn t work at all 
len ratingone Doesn t work after update
len ratingfour When are you going to support Apple AirPods 
len ratingfive Love it For my job and my kid school
len ratingone Crashes after seconds on the splash screen 
len ratingone Since the most recent IOS update the app won t even open anymore 
len ratingone It just crashes every time I attempt to use it 
len ratingone I am constantly getting more and more frustrated the more I am forced to use this app for work 
len ratingone Strictly using this because I am forced to and it s unendingly annoying
len ratingthree One thing I have noticed is that when I am a guest participant and shown as muted on MY end I am not shown with a muted icon on the participant list AND the microphone LED is showing an active listener which indicates the mic is NOT muted on the client side only the server AND that the audio data from the microphone may still be sent to Microsoft 
len ratingthree This is a HUGE privacy concern 
len ratingthree Uhm so I can t edit anything I have to do for school cause it requires a higher iOS
len ratingfive This app is great I use it for my school
len ratingone It doesn t get past the loading screen after the latest update 
len ratingfour One recent example that It shut down whenever i tried to see my saved bookmarks in the bottom right menu on iphone
len ratingone I HATE THIS UGLY TEAMS THEY ALL BE TEXTING ME LIKE SHUT UP THE NOTIFICATIONS SOUNDS ARE SO ANNOYING I WANT TO DRAF THIS APP OR THE PERSON WHO MADE TEACHERS HAVE RO MUCH POWER IN THIS APP IAM NOT IN WITH IT LITTLE RAT THEY BE BLOWING UP MY PHONE DELET DELET DELET I HATE THIS APPLPPPPPPPPPP HELP USE AT LEAST DONT KET SCHOLL USE THIS USLESS THIS PORIS IAM LAUGHING IAM CRYING IT FEELS LIKE IAM DYEING Melanie Martinez ANY WAYS I feel much better 
len ratingone So bad I hate this
len ratingone This app has been very good until now where I have a persistent chat notification saying I have unread chat which I don t aka as a fake notification 
len ratingone It s only on my iPhone anywhere else I don t have this notification 
len ratingone For a big time company this should be able to be fixed relatively quick 
len ratingone I do homework on this app gets a star for me
len ratingone Okay so it s a nice app inall but ITS A LAGG 
len ratingone IT REALLY Got me MAD 
len ratingfive Does what it s supposed to do 
len ratingfive Pretty good app from my experience 
len ratingfive It has a user friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate 
len ratingfive Pretty straightforward
len ratingfour The App it s self is good but when I put on headphones the sound only comes out of the left speaker 
len ratingfour Please fix this Microsoft 
len ratingthree Honestly wish the clock in shifts option actually works but the app does help so that I can travel while working
len ratingone On iPhone with iOS and app isn t working 
len ratingone It s stuck on the logo whenever I open it and then shuts down on its own 
len ratingone No way to login or bypass the logo screen 
len ratingone I m on the latest Teams update on iOS 
len ratingone Even before with the app the app just isn t good 
len ratingone There s no way to decrease the volume any more than the in app functionality will let me and so even at the quietest volume the volume is still much too loud 
len ratingfour I love the app i do all of my work through teams and it s relatively easy to use but when it comes to switching accounts it s very difficult it would be so helpful if there was a switch accounts button or something of that sort just to make it easier on people who have to have multiple accounts for different meetings 
len ratingfive MS Teams is the best way to hold meetings virtually 
len ratingfive It gathers everyone safely amd we can talk about work in detail and yet being safe in terms of Covid precautions 
len ratingfive The leadership can flash power points which we all can see and discuss with 
len ratingfive Overall its a perfect tool for an office meeting 
len ratingfive Its awesome 
len ratingone It s so annoying that it changes status from online to away so quickly 
len ratingone I joined a meeting and since I just have to listen it shows I m away after a few mins but truth is I m still sitting in front of the monitor 
len ratingone I go to bathroom and comes back it shows I m away I go to the kitchen to get a coffee comes back it shows me that I m away I turn around to discuss sth with coworker without using it it shows I m away 
len ratingone It does not help with a manager who looks at the status to determine if someone is slacking at work and that s extremely not fair 
len ratingone It does not reasonably reflect someone s status 
len ratingthree App was working fine for the past year 
len ratingthree Now all of a sudden it won t even open 
len ratingone I have had to use teams for school 
len ratingone It s not at all good 
len ratingone It has kicked me out of my classes a total of six times and I expect more 
len ratingone The program is laggy and the video quality is horrible 
len ratingone Just don t download it 
len ratingone Since the last update app won t open and does not work 
len ratingone Did not have any issues before that 
len ratingfour There is a lot of noise when someone in the meeting talks and it s so annoying 
len ratingfour On the other hand it s a pretty good app 
len ratingthree Fix the sharing audio already 
len ratingthree Its the main issue here and it took so long 
len ratingthree Had to work on our ipad and smartphones 
len ratingthree We are on 
len ratingone Don t get this app unless it s dire 
len ratingone It s terrible
len ratingthree I ve tried so many times but teams is slow is there anyway to fix it 
len ratingthree If so please do it it s bothering me so much 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingone I want to change my profile picture 
len ratingthree The screen sharing does not have a full screen mode 
len ratingthree Participant list covers at least of the screen space 
len ratingthree The UI could be simple it lacks usability and user experience 
len ratingthree There are other usability related issues long meeting URL hard to get dial in number iOS screen sharing got to have app rather through airplay as in Zoom 
len ratingone After update not working 
len ratingfive The best way to talk to annoying team members 
len ratingfive Love how easy it is to use with outlook and syncs with calendar 
len ratingfive Great meeting experience 
len ratingone I really want to rate this app a star but I can t 
len ratingone Everything is working perfectly fine but only these two things which are Lagging issues when a lot of people chat it lags so bad and this is not my WiFi 
len ratingone Ok that reason is not that good but this issue is way better 
len ratingone When someone is calling me into a meeting and I press accept it brings me to the teams post and not the meeting call 
len ratingone And I have been marked absent because of this issue 
len ratingone Now the notifications when I get notifications it usually shows on the top of the notification M ago which is minutes ago 
len ratingone That s my really only issue with the notifications 
len ratingone It used to work but now it doesn t 
len ratingone I have uninstalled and installed again without success 
len ratingone Things that aren t working Well I think is better to list that the only page that does work is the recent activity 
len ratingone The rest of them is just the spinning wheel of death 
len ratingfour Good app with most of the desktop app s functionality 
len ratingfour In some ways I prefer the this iOS iPadOS app to the Mac OS and Windows desktop versions of Teams 
len ratingfour This version needs more functionality with the Apple Watch particularly the chat feature 
len ratingfive Very versatile easy to use professional 
len ratingfive Love the ease of use and quick connection 
len ratingfive Would love to see some consistency between devices 
len ratingone Used to work fine doesn t go past the loading screen anymore since the latest update 
len ratingone Only works after I delete and reinstall the app 
len ratingone Not worth the work 
len ratingone Non functional therefor useless on iPhone Xr 
len ratingone Teams does not work with the new update
len ratingfour The app is good overall however I think it would be encouraging if the camera had filters Perhaps more students would have their camera on while they are in virtual school 
len ratingone After the update the app does not open 
len ratingone I cannot access any messages 
len ratingfive I started this position from home and I ve made connections on this app like we sat side by side in training together 
len ratingfive I really believe this app made it possible 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingfive I use my teams on my iPhone XR and I m trying to figure out how to set up the background I ve never done it before and even on my laptop I don t see the option both through the app and online 
len ratingfour I reluctantly added Teams to my iPhone 
len ratingfour I wish I had done it sooner because it makes it easier for me to navigate the two jobs that I have 
len ratingtwo This ap especially with the power and integration with Microsoft has the potential to be great but consistently falls down on the execution side 
len ratingtwo A few issues 
len ratingtwo Call history voice mail chats and other screens perpetually are stuck loading 
len ratingtwo Restarting reinstalling force quit all do nothing to help 
len ratingtwo Video feeds are inconsistent fail for group calls if you try to navigate the ap or switch screens at all 
len ratingtwo Unlike ios call log where all you need to do is open the screen to acknowledge the missed call there are multiple menus to navigate for each one to mark as read seen 
len ratingtwo When the call history fails per the ios call history is also affected meaning you can t find or make return calls at all from the ap or operating system 
len ratingtwo Hope you have a backup way to see who called you 
len ratingtwo I can t give this one star as it s not the lowest of the quality aps I use but definitely a failing grade is warranted 
len ratingtwo If my organization didn t tie everything through Microsoft and its office suite I would definitely not be using 
len ratingfive This is the best tool for business communications 
len ratingfive Great ui features and very stable 
len ratingtwo It is way to hard to login and well they should let you login with your school s login
len ratingtwo So I ve been online learning on Microsoft teams about like a year and just today morning my Microsoft teams is broken 
len ratingtwo I have join several teams and they said I joined no teams and the chat is loading for so long 
len ratingtwo I m so dissatisfied and disappointed 
len ratingtwo For some reason Teams on my iPhone will not work with my AirPods 
len ratingtwo They connect and I can start calls with them but they will switch to the speaker a couple minutes later 
len ratingtwo This happens every single time 
len ratingtwo I have no issues with my AirPods in any other app or with other devices only Teams on iOS 
len ratingfour  I ve been using Teams in an official capacity for almost two years as of today 
len ratingfour There s a lot of things I like about the app 
len ratingfour It follows closely to the streamlined set up for voice and text as seen in Discord with the file sharing systems of SharePoint but without the lag time between loading sites over site 
len ratingfour Overall it s a great base however there are a lot of quality of life features that need to implemented for it to be a great app or stars 
len ratingfour When visiting the forums you see people have invested considerable time in finding work around solutions to problems that should have been features out the gate but that s software development for you 
len ratingfour Microsoft wanted this product on the market as soon as possible in conjuncture with its cloud suite and it shows in how the app almost feels like a beta 
len ratingfour Despite the missing quality of life features for people like myself who need to set up infrastructure within teams to service a corporation the app itself runs smooth and is easy to navigate for the end user 
len ratingfour For this reason it s an easy star for me and I can see this becoming a star for sure in a couple of years 
len ratingthree Need multi window support 
len ratingthree In mobile app 
len ratingthree one for meeting one for chat moreove could not open excel file gor editin in my mobile 
len ratingtwo This took FOREVER to download not to add the time it took to download a video in assignments that ended up not working 
len ratingtwo If you re going to get this just know that it s really bad on my IPhone
len ratingfour Fin
len ratingone It s so slow on every device it s not good
len ratingfour I have I need for Adobe PDF forms to work in the teams environment but cannot get that to work 
len ratingfour The other option would be to have a more mobile friendly app for Microsoft Excel 
len ratingfour I am a huge fan of Microsoft teams but this limitation definitely impacts our operations and need to explore other options 
len ratingthree I don t like the how the presence doesn t show that r on the phone not even sure if it show busy 
len ratingthree For the last week or so the app has not been pushing notifications I have to manually refresh to get chats 
len ratingthree Everything is ok with the notifications settings in the app and the iPhone system settings 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingfive A very helpful apps and easy to use 
len ratingthree I need a way to use notes from my iPad to draw like a whiteboard during meeting
len ratingfive It s become the string around my finger to remind me that I m not alone in this endeavor to make things better for the big picture for the whole to make the group more productive and cohesive 
len ratingone I have good Internet and the most estros but it disconnects you a lot
len ratingone bro it s honestly so bad like i dont even know what to tell you man 
len ratingone it s just really annoying how well it works thats why im giving it such a bad rating because it s good 
len ratingone literally no other reason 
len ratingone k bye
len ratingone i dont like this app 
len ratingone first of all its boring and nd i cant do assigments here 
len ratingone why this app even exists 
len ratingone teachers are forcing me to TURN CAMERA THEY ARE SO ANNOYING
len ratingthree I like the messaging features and the web conferencing appears to be more stable than Cisco Webex
len ratingone Always glitches takes forever to get in and most of the time voice video or some other feature is not functioning
len ratingfive So easy and convenient to use this app 
len ratingfive I use other programs as well but definitely prefer this one 
len ratingthree Why doesn t team have virtual background for mobile devices just blur 
len ratingfour Everything works except user statuses in chat 
len ratingfour In order to get those statuses to update or refresh you have to enter each chat with each individual person and then come out 
len ratingfour And the status still doesn t refresh until you do it one more time 
len ratingfour Also reading the message on a PC used to remove the notification from your phone 
len ratingfour Not the case anymore 
len ratingfour Not sure what changed 
len ratingfour Wish there was an option to make the dark light theme follow the system settings on my phone that change based on sunset sunrise 
len ratingfour All job work nice instead Remote accessing in linux versions 
len ratingfour the clients which installed linux Team app cant have access control to each other
len ratingone This app has stopped working after ios update 
len ratingone Regards
len ratingone Teachers use this app to make lives more miserable I have to do hours of regular school work on top of the random things they assign
len ratingone this app is dope and all but it s not helping my depression but if it s not the apps fault but honestly i don t like it 
len ratingfive good app but i don t like school
len ratingone My mental health is rapidly declining and teachers are assigning more and more and more on here so i m taking it out on the app 
len ratingone sorry 
len ratingone i hate this app we use it for school it s super slow and glitchy 
len ratingone  i hate this app we use it for school it s super slow and glitchy 
len ratingfive  I think this app is the best thing since sliced bread it s very easy to use and always working which is important when you doing video conferencing I like this app a lot and will continue to use it as my go to meeting app
len ratingfive Yes I work for Microsoft but like any other app I use it has to work well 
len ratingfive And work well it does 
len ratingfive It is literally an extension of my desktop 
len ratingfive I use my Microsoft Teams mobile app as much as my desktop app and bot are in use full time all day every day 
len ratingfive I can switch seamlessly from being in a meeting in my remote office to my mobile with no disruption 
len ratingfive I can switch a call to my mobile while joining another or vice versa so I can be in two places at one how else to conquer my day 
len ratingfive I can respond to a chat during those normally non productive times when time is simply wasted otherwise 
len ratingfive It s a productivity game changer 
len ratingthree Volume control is still a problem 
len ratingthree Why is it taking so long to fix this issue
len ratingone No me gusta por que como clases 
len ratingthree I use Microsoft teams for man classes and need to have my camera on but when i do split screen on my iPad my camera shuts off and when this happens my teacher blames me 
len ratingthree Yeah that my only problem with this 
len ratingfour App is pretty great except for the fact that I am seeing an invisible notification for a chat that doesn t exist
len ratingfive I am not always a fan of Microsoft products but this is truly an ingenious product 
len ratingfive All communication I 
len ratingfive One spot 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone  That s why I put just a star
len ratingfive  The app is just as easy as the desktop version which means that working is simplified 
len ratingfive Having continued upgrades means that some of the things that I complained about in have been fixed or are options now 
len ratingfive  Such as teams remembering your when using your phone for audio and breakout room features in meetings 
len ratingfive I love having the app option for my phone and it makes my life easier 
len ratingfive I love Teams 
len ratingfive It s reliable easy to use performance and switches between multiple devices 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It would be nice if the teams app would tie to Microsoft outlook like Skype and let you know if someone is online or not 
len ratingfour Have enjoyed the teams format has saved a lot of time traveling and expense 
len ratingfour Just wish Bill Gates wasn t so liberal and he could get a handle on his wife s insane ideas 
len ratingfour So I use the app for school it s a pretty good app and it s very helpful since we are all in a pandemic and I can t go to in person school this is what we have been using for are meetings over all this is a pretty great app but a lot of people in my class get updates on there app and some don t 
len ratingfour A lot of them tried to download the app again a few times and they still didn t get the update they checked there settings and everything like that and just a lot of people didn t ever get updates even when the looked at settings and re downloaded it
len ratingfive This app helps us too communicate in an effective and timely manner 
len ratingfive It helps allow us to stay on task 
len ratingtwo Can t adjust my notifications
len ratingthree Teams gets easier as you use it 
len ratingthree The layout is not intuitive at first 
len ratingthree However the inability to delete chats is annoying 
len ratingthree It makes for much clutter which is unneccessary 
len ratingfive We are in the middle of a much needed upgrade 
len ratingfive My team is working hard transitioning to this and I m really excited 
len ratingfour Love everything about it 
len ratingfour Great tool 
len ratingfour The only check box it is missing is Brady bunch chat function 
len ratingfour This feels like such a huge miss was it done on purpose 
len ratingfour Why would you not have a simple view option for or whatever grid pattern that makes sense 
len ratingfour Anyway sense there was no decision matrix used in going to teams it was overlooked could ve possibly suede whether or not we went to teams and now IT is forced to explain that this feature is not available 
len ratingfour Users look at us like we just don t know how to turn that on 
len ratingone I have to use this app for my job through my college and never had we have this many problems using Teams 
len ratingone Some days I can chat using the chat during a call and other times we aren t able to use the chat as we are no longer a member of the chat The app and desktop version is so clunky and I you d think it would better when literal businesses are depending on the software 
len ratingfive This is a wonderful app
len ratingone I HATE TEAMS ITS UGLY 
len ratingfour Easy way to organize projects and deliver tasks and manage the process 
len ratingfour Can also manage across state lines 
len ratingfive User friendly interface 
len ratingfive  Make a update so that presenters can turn on atendees cameras on
len ratingfour I m a teacher and I depend on the iPhone app to view notifications while I m teaching 
len ratingfour Lately notifications have worked very intermittently 
len ratingfour My notifications are set to always all my channels are enabled I did not set up quiet hours or days I have logged out and in of the app uninstalled and reinstalled the app and my notifications are on in iOS 
len ratingfour Many other people have this problem if you Google it 
len ratingfour Please fix the notifications 
len ratingfive I was used to the simplicity of Skype 
len ratingfive While Teams has functionality well beyond what Skype could do quick tasks require me open Teams 
len ratingfive Need better or more friendly Contacts management ability 
len ratingfive Can t delete contacts 
len ratingfive Cannot view in any other format list for e g Finishing people on contacts is cumbersome
len ratingthree Convenient App but have a lot of problems when we share screens 
len ratingthree Then just freezes amp we need to jump over to zoom
len ratingone Couldn t make myself bigger than an inch 
len ratingone Couldn t position myself anywhere other than lower right 
len ratingone No co spotlight feature 
len ratingone Had a hard time making the names of my audience members appear 
len ratingone The elementary kids I was presenting to also had the ability to mute anyone so I constantly had to unmute myself 
len ratingone Worst virtual meeting experience I ve ever had 
len ratingone There were other issues as well 
len ratingone Microsoft should be embarrassed to put this product out there 
len ratingone How does anyone use this app 
len ratingone My battery doesn t hold up a day 
len ratingone I have not opened this app yet today yet it has used of my battery by lunchtime with almost hours of time in the background 
len ratingone Removing this app 
len ratingfour  We need to share video sounds when it will be possible in the iPad version 
len ratingone The most recent app update will not allow me to open the app 
len ratingone I tried resetting my phone deleting and reinstalling the app 
len ratingone Still the same 
len ratingone Unable to access 
len ratingone You can t listen to the good reviews 
len ratingone Trust me 
len ratingone I ve used teams the whole first semester so far as a student and it s been an experience 
len ratingone Y all need to know the truth so buckle up cuz this is about to get interesting 
len ratingone For starters the most important feature meetings 
len ratingone When you join a meeting it automatically unmutes you which I can speak from experience is very annoying especially when you don t realize it until half way through class 
len ratingone Another thing with the microphones is that it will say your muted in the meeting when your not 
len ratingone Stick with me 
len ratingone When your mic is muted it has the microphone icon with a slash through it 
len ratingone Well it will show that symbol but I CAN HEAR MYSELF ECHOING IN THE CLASSROOM AMD ON ITHER PEOPLES DEVISES 
len ratingone Bruh that s a violation of FERPA 
len ratingone Anyway on zoom when you talk you know how it shows the yellow square around your picture well teams doesn t have that 
len ratingone You can see when others are talking but there is nothing that s shows that there is noise coming from your end of the computer 
len ratingone One more thing about the meetings is that if you join on a computer sometimes the whole meeting will glitch and it won t allow you to mute yourself without turning off your volume entirely 
len ratingone Moving on from the microphone issue there is also i massive issue with hanging up 
len ratingone Sometimes when you try to hang up sometimes it will show that the button is being pressed but it won t leave the meeting you usually have to resort to closing out the app entirely 
len ratingone So I m General the app is not user friendly with meetings 
len ratingone Now assignments 
len ratingone My school uses teams as our main platform so we have to access documents and assignments from teams 
len ratingone For starters teams glitches a lot and won t let you access your assignments or files which gets annoying 
len ratingone Also when you submit something from Microsoft word or PowerPoint it s messed up the format and text basically overlaps everything and makes it completely illegible 
len ratingone Another issue with assignment submissions is that you can t submit pictures because it sends the pictures all out of order 
len ratingone On the bright side the chat isn t bad 
len ratingone It s actually really nice for communicating with teachers and classmates just don t send anything in a breakout room chat because it will post in the general page for your class so basically the whole class can see it 
len ratingone  One last thing TEACHERS LISTEN UP 
len ratingone The students can make you a participant and mute you 
len ratingone I m not joking kids in my class have done it 
len ratingone  I m conclusion thank you for listening to all this I m just trying to warn everybody about this app 
len ratingone Just use zoom and google classroom or schoology please 
len ratingone Also as a disclaimer everything that I just mentioned has happened to me and many other students that I ve talked to 
len ratingone Also I am very literate in technology so it s not like I m just being stupid and then complaining about my stupidity 
len ratingone These are real issues that need to be addressed 
len ratingone So thanks for coming to my Ted Talk and again PLEASE JUST USE ZOOM AND GOOGLE CLASSROOM SCHOOLOGY 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive This is awesome for connecting with other people 
len ratingtwo I am a public defender in NYC and the court system has moved to this platform to conduct remote court appearances 
len ratingtwo Since early November many members of my organization as well as many prosecutors have been unable to access the chat feature when we sign in to the courtrooms 
len ratingtwo This is incredibly detrimental to our work because the chat is used for signing up cases and other essential communication 
len ratingtwo Sometimes I can use a workaround by signing out of Teams and joining as a guest but even this is hit and miss and it deprives me of most of the other helpful features of the app 
len ratingtwo Frankly I wish the courts had stuck with Skype for Business 
len ratingtwo I wasn t having these problems then 
len ratingtwo I have been told by my organization that the problem is on Microsoft s end and they are working on it 
len ratingtwo It has been two and a half months and I have not seen any progress on the issue or heard any updates about when we might expect a solution 
len ratingfive Please fix the audio when using an iPad and teams everyone said I sound weird on the iPad 
len ratingone No way to turn off Cortana in the app 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingfive When u finally find the groups everything s looks and works amazing
len ratingone i hate u
len ratingfour Need more band width for people 
len ratingfour Works sometimes but not all 
len ratingfour Other that that great app
len ratingfive Gart
len ratingfive  Check the title
len ratingone It unmutes when I close the this meeting is being recorded message 
len ratingone I don t know what s going on but they need to fix this
len ratingone Microsoft teams is constantly having video chat troubles it is incredible laggy and we are just always having trouble with it in school 
len ratingone Microsoft is a huge company so I do not understand why they cannot improve their apps 
len ratingfive Teams is easy to learn 
len ratingfive Makes messaging fun 
len ratingfive My Teams App had been crashing every time I tried to join a meeting from my phone after updating to the previous revision 
len ratingfive Thanks for fixing or reverting to an earlier revision 
len ratingfour I usually give a star rating but today I lost half of my meeting because it said looking for network on my end Everything was perfect as in all bars and and my connectiveness 
len ratingfour Teams is a solid dependable messaging app and a must have it you are in the Office ecosystem 
len ratingfour My only complaint is that photo sharing is extremely laggy and glitchy 
len ratingtwo It blinks and my phone turns off
len ratingfive Teams is an amazing application 
len ratingfive It is a great way to efficiently reach team members and share information 
len ratingfive I like the layout 
len ratingone A farce of an app 
len ratingone You have to wait days to combine email to phone numbers 
len ratingone I cannot stand Microsoft and genuinely believe their roll in tech to provide customers with obstacles steal ideas and scam them out of money 
len ratingone Please go innovate 
len ratingone Such a joke 
len ratingfour The app still has a gigantic keyboard because it hasn t taken advantage of the iPhone s different screen resolution
len ratingfour It s pretty good and you can schedule calls 
len ratingfour But the camera quality is low and sometimes the microphone disappears and and it s hard to open the chat but it s overall a good app 
len ratingfive I use it all the time in school and it helps me so much 
len ratingone We can t chat anymore
len ratingone Can you fix this glitch whenever I turn in a assignment it sometimes it doesn t appear in complete for some reason
len ratingfour This app would be perfect if you could access tasks from here 
len ratingthree Cause it makes me do school but other wise 
len ratingfour Please add the feature to mute conversations on teams with bluetooth headphones it gets really annoying when I m trying to do tests work during solo time in classes and I can still hear the teacher talking in the background 
len ratingone The mobile app has been malfunctioning recently
len ratingfive I do a job that requires I make life and death decisions in a moment 
len ratingfive I have to make the decisions on my own but I can t do that without a team behind me for support and consultation nobody should take on the liability of somebody else s life without getting a second opinion 
len ratingfive When Covid hit and this job became remote it became much harder to make that happen we could see clients we couldn t necessarily have a team 
len ratingfive Teams has made it possible now I still feel connected to my team like I m in the office with them in real time we talk we consult and it makes sure we stay connected via chats calendars team messages and alerts and so much more 
len ratingfive Teams app has take our intra staff communication to a new level 
len ratingfive Hoping that all staff will join on to learn to appreciate and share out information to one another 
len ratingfive The Microsoft Teams app is pretty intuitive from my experience
len ratingone The idiots in charge of making this app somehow completely disabled the ability to receive mobile notifications
len ratingfour It s not slack but it works
len ratingone  My Teams App has been crashing every time I try to join a meeting from my phone after updating to the latest release 
len ratingone Prior to this the app was stars 
len ratingone Please fix or revert to the previous revision 
len ratingone Now my video camera gives me an error saying your admin does not permit video from being turned on I have been using this app on my iPad for almost a year and it s been working find 
len ratingone Then I update and boom all settings and camera video is lost 
len ratingone How can I fix this so that I can conduct business 
len ratingthree Scooters can be iffy especially when it comes to those that are costly 
len ratingthree But this one made it totally worth the cost it s wheels are tough and durable and it handles like a Bette definite recommend 
len ratingone so i used this app for class but some how it takes long to load even with the best wifi
len ratingone  Bad trash garbage school
len ratingone Nearly a year into remote work this is desperately needed 
len ratingone  This app doesn t work at all whenever I am trying to join my classes it doesn t work I m telling you if I had a penny for every time this app didn t work I would be a billionaire
len ratingfour Please make a thumbs up button I don t wanna talk in class
len ratingone Accessing work meetings from iPhone causes app crossover issues when I access other apps 
len ratingone Teams crashes if I open Gmail for example 
len ratingone If you lose wifi you disconnect call why not just use my data plan 
len ratingone Swapping mute on off is slow 
len ratingone Response time in the app for swapping speaker headset takes too long 
len ratingone Plugging in iPhone headphones won t transmit sound to headphones 
len ratingone If you turn on BT headset you re at best going to swap sound to BT or completely lose the sound entirely 
len ratingone Disappointing 
len ratingone Zoom and other meeting apps make Microsoft look like a startup 
len ratingthree I really liked this app but somethings are really annoying like when it glitches and takes me out of the app and when I what to hear an audio it tells me can t play this message In conclusion we need to UPDATE OR TO BE FIXED 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingfive I would be the last surviving member of my family if it wasn t for Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive Virtual backgrounds are good too 
len ratingfive We use the Microsoft version 
len ratingfive I have a iPhone for the app 
len ratingfive I was at home but I keep the notification on for this app 
len ratingfive It s as good as the computer version in a scaled down version 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingone this app is very laggy and it always kicks me out of the app
len ratingfive I teams
len ratingfive Teams is very effective message system and calls are very clear 
len ratingone Y cant u add the brackround option on mobile 
len ratingone I use teams fir school and i would like it so they see me not whats behind me
len ratingone Add sound to screen share on ipad
len ratingfour Overall very good app for remote collaboration
len ratingfive Great service and way to be connected
len ratingone I tried but it requires a phone number
len ratingfive This is an excellent way to communicate with members of my team and well as others from different teams 
len ratingfive It allows me to get real time info have short conversations without having to interrupt conference calls 
len ratingfive It also allows me to track my daily schedule 
len ratingthree I must say that it is a stable and reliable app for homeschooling but too much battery consumption and it is getting worst between updates 
len ratingthree This happens in my brand new iPads 
len ratingthree Hope the Microsoft tech team behind the app take a look and solve this issue 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingfive Easy to use and works great 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive My company uses it and we use it for everything 
len ratingfive No lags no problems 
len ratingfive Screen sharing is so easy 
len ratingfive We do trainings group session everything on it 
len ratingfive Great use 
len ratingfour Every time I open up Teams it takes me to a page that is a chat within a chat and when I select the back button to get back to the options on the bottom the app doesn t recognize the function 
len ratingfour I have to swipe out of app and try again 
len ratingfour Usually it comes back to normal after the st or nd attempt but there have been times where it has taken several restarts to get it back to normal 
len ratingfive One of the awesome apps in recent times to communicate with everyone
len ratingone I can t join my call with mobile data
len ratingone  Microsoft finds it easier to have the users do the job that the developers and sysadmins are paid to do and claim it s a safe and secure app now because you re doing their work for them 
len ratingone But that s what you get when you hire these children that have no idea how to truly program good applications or even software nowadays 
len ratingone I hate in it should be banned period 
len ratingfour First of all this app is amazing for school but sometimes when i try to join a class it won t let me please fix that
len ratingone Ayuden a la patria y borren teams 
len ratingone  I don t like digital school
len ratingtwo  Can you please sort contact list on the phone app just like the desktop app 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive I use Teams for Work and it s a great way of communicating with other colleagues without having to zoom 
len ratingone Not true 
len ratingone Doesn t work 
len ratingone Only light and dark available as choices 
len ratingone No choice for system 
len ratingthree It s not terrible but discord does everything it does plus more and is easier to use so why would anyone use this 
len ratingfive What an amazing business solution and tool 
len ratingfive Allows you house needed items in separate locations for separate groups and transition to video or voice calls to support your team in an instant without setting up a call or meeting 
len ratingfive Screen record option is super convenient when performing a demonstration or how to 
len ratingone Huge Drain on battery uses more power than Facebook 
len ratingone Continues to run in background even when closed 
len ratingone Please address battery usage 
len ratingfive Easy to communicate and updates about my gate operations 
len ratingfive Excellent intuitive user interface 
len ratingfive We use this for my team at work and it s great 
len ratingfour You guys need to add the mute button to the Apple Watch when on a teams meeting 
len ratingfour I don t know if this is because you don t have an Apple Watch version but when I am on a normal phone call I can mute from my watch but I cannot do this on teams 
len ratingfive Can have conversations calendar sync virtual meetings store files 
len ratingfive It s a great app for business 
len ratingtwo When my class start I can t see them and I miss my classes because they are not appearing
len ratingfive This app is great for Teams meetings on the go 
len ratingfive No complaints great user experience 
len ratingfive The Best of for corporate communication 
len ratingfive There is nothing you can t do with this app 
len ratingfive It s a pretty sweet app to have 
len ratingfive I find it easier to communicate with my team instead of composing emails or having to blanket text people 
len ratingfive  stars 
len ratingone Whose idea was that 
len ratingone I don t need an email every time a messages is sent 
len ratingone That s what the app notifications are for 
len ratingone I don t know how to fix this in settings if you even can and some how both browsers I use are unsupported so I can t see the full settings menu 
len ratingfive  Once I learned how to use it I truly love it 
len ratingfive I primarily use it for work and study groups 
len ratingfive It s an awesome way to conduct professional business without meeting in person 
len ratingfive The screen sharing is awesome for meetings 
len ratingfive I highly suggest using it on all devices 
len ratingfive The best functionality is with your computer but you can meet with your phone or iPad as well 
len ratingtwo The teams app is good but the request for feedback like this takes wastes my time 
len ratingtwo I d actually consider switching vs getting these daily how s our app doing pop up surveys
len ratingone I don t like homework 
len ratingfour Please provide feature
len ratingfive Good job Bill 
len ratingone Alright guys so I rated this one star because this app for some reason have reviews and I know most are kids smh guys vote this app a one star guys together we are one 
len ratingfive My school uses teams and my school caught students on it so they locked it from are school iPads and they HATE TEAMS but it s a good app thank e
len ratingone Gg
len ratingtwo  When joining a meeting with muted microphone it gets unmuted after pressing Join 
len ratingone Garbage I can t see my meetings thanks a lot jeepers u people literally this app is crap
len ratingfive Literally just Microsoft discord
len ratingone I never receive calls to my phone 
len ratingone I see it pop up on my desktop but my phone only dings once I have missed the call 
len ratingone Not great for business to constantly miss calls and have to return them 
len ratingfive Really enjoying the experience would be nice if my department would finally deploy it Navigation could be a bit better 
len ratingone many children agree with me on this one because teachers are extra by making us turn on our cameras 
len ratingone I don t like this app that much 
len ratingone Also it glitches a lot 
len ratingone Sometimes it also doesn t wanna open 
len ratingone It also kicks me out of meetings 
len ratingfive Seamless 
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingfive Teams is very fluid for remote working and collating information 
len ratingfive Also love the calling features over Webex
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingfour I love everything about this platform but the calendar 
len ratingfour This is for business persons 
len ratingfour What business person only schedules things within days while in the field 
len ratingfour It needs to be months with ability to see multiple views including daily weekly monthly 
len ratingfour It s super annoying 
len ratingthree  Not getting iOS notifications for approvals On desktop and Android there are notifications in the activity feed for any approvals 
len ratingthree In iOS there are no such notifications 
len ratingthree Please correct 
len ratingone Anyone And where do they hide the prices for apps when you buy them on Apple 
len ratingfive  Microsoft has created a truly outstanding tool that has proved itself invaluable with regards to remote working from an iPad iPhone 
len ratingfive A few items that would be game changers To match the functionality of Zoom on iPad OS the camera should remain on when in slide over split screen mode 
len ratingfive This is ESSENTIAL 
len ratingfive  On iPad allow users to open chat participant list in a sidebar while still viewing the participants in the call 
len ratingfive The fact that the entirety of the screen is taken up by chat and participant list is a major frustration when monitoring groups and or chat 
len ratingfive  In call support keyboard shortcuts for muting unmuting opening chat participant list at a minimum 
len ratingfive The recent addition of keyboard shortcuts for formatting posts is appreciated 
len ratingfive  Ability to manage breakout rooms via iPad OS 
len ratingfive I realize this feature is currently in beta on desktop 
len ratingfive Thanks for all the fantastic work on the app 
len ratingfive All colleagues are connected and reachable anytime 
len ratingtwo For some insane reason Teams deliberately refuses to connect to Bluetooth headsets both on phone and desktop apps 
len ratingtwo This alone is enough reason to go with a competitor 
len ratingtwo Add to that the conflicts between personal and work emails and this makes the product impossible to recommend 
len ratingtwo Connection quality looks good but that s hardly enough 
len ratingfive  I use this app for my online school 
len ratingfive However I also use this to chat with friends and call 
len ratingfive In my opinion it is a VERY useful app 
len ratingfive I can keep track of my school and socialize with friends during COVID 
len ratingfive Though I do not have any negative thoughts about this I think it is still being updated and it has a long way to go 
len ratingfive It s great but I m just writing this review so it never asks me to review it again 
len ratingthree Would be helpful to organize teams with sub folders vs a long list of teams at the same hierarchy 
len ratingfour The app is great for communication with my teams 
len ratingfour The only thing that would make it better is an Apple Watch version 
len ratingtwo With iphone ios it causes overheating notice and device stops running 
len ratingtwo So for my homework I normally have more than one link on my homework 
len ratingtwo So when I open up two teams when I hop back to one and another each time it says are you still there 
len ratingtwo And then it makes me reload and it waist my time and it s annoying 
len ratingtwo But for that stars
len ratingfive The audio needs improving it lags and is choppy but overall good app
len ratingfive Universal tool for any company or business to use 
len ratingfour A great App so far 
len ratingfour We recently migrated from slack and have found steams equally easy but more robust 
len ratingfour Teams has video obviously 
len ratingfour But I did give it stars because the video call section is a bit confusing compared to Zoom and the call equality is definitely NOT as good as Slack 
len ratingfour We use Microsoft as often as possible instead of Zoom for security reasons but at least once or twice a week I have to cancel a trams meeting and invite everyone to join Zoom instead as the compression in Zoom is so much better if anyone on the call has weak internet
len ratingone The app controls my notifications I turn the notifications off and I still keep getting them and it s boring
len ratingthree Wish there was a way to stay logged in from my Mobile phone
len ratingfive This platform really works well of the time 
len ratingfive There are network issues from time to time but all in all this single application replaces share drives teleconferencing telephones and chat 
len ratingfive This really is a game changer 
len ratingfive It s a great way to stay connected with the Team 
len ratingfive Better user options by far 
len ratingfive As a team we love this app we can do so much from it 
len ratingfive Voice video IM etc 
len ratingfive We re loving it 
len ratingfour Team has been very convenient for working with coworkers 
len ratingfour It is very easy to set up a meeting 
len ratingfour The only negative is that is not very straightforward when you need to call a coworker via your phone app but want to share what you have open on your desktop from your work computer 
len ratingtwo Everything works very well except screen sharing 
len ratingtwo It freezes all the time especially when using a computer 
len ratingfour  There is a lot of noise when someone in the meeting talks and it s so annoying 
len ratingfour On the other hand it s a pretty good app 
len ratingone Productivity isn t productivity unless you do it their way 
len ratingone Companies pay to have their teams waste time trying to make teams app work 
len ratingone It s too rigid one drive integration creates incomprehensible messes of office files 
len ratingone I have yet to collaboratively edit a file that didn t have to have a copy saved and then replaced manually later 
len ratingone Requiring MS accounts on my iPhone is such a pain 
len ratingone Office doesn t sync to the native Calendar app 
len ratingone It s and their calendar doesn t sync up with iOS Calendar 
len ratingfour No option to create user or team groups as we do in Skype
len ratingone Microsoft teams is soooo slow 
len ratingone It makes my device lag everytime I join a call please fix this 
len ratingthree Need better wiki search functionality 
len ratingfive The ability to dry up channels with clients and other with staff only gives up unprecedented communication knowledge awareness that we didn t have before everything about Teams is well thought of intuitive and high technological quality 
len ratingone  No fine grain control over notifications emails is really bad 
len ratingone Most of my company is on the other side of the world so the messages they post will not be read by my in their work day 
len ratingone Microsoft thinks they are being helpful by sending you an email telling you you missed this message 
len ratingone Of course I missed the message 
len ratingone I m more then hours difference 
len ratingone I don t need emails telling me I missed a comment 
len ratingone There is no way to properly disable these emails 
len ratingone I ve gone through all the help documents and they don t even match what the menus look like anymore 
len ratingone I now have my email delete any new mail from Teams 
len ratingone  Feature parity with the app is lacking 
len ratingone The desktop version can translate messages but the app still cannot 
len ratingone Microsoft doesn t making coping the text from a comment easily as it is very garbeled 
len ratingone It s a lot of work if I have to copy a comment and put into another translator 
len ratingone Check out ZDnet s article I looked at all the ways Microsoft Teams tracks users and my head is spinning 
len ratingone The amount of metrics teams collects is disgusting 
len ratingfive I love that I can replace zoom and WhatsApp with one app 
len ratingfive I also can get Smartsheet to integrate with it 
len ratingfive Other than the inability to delete old chats Teams is working quite nicely for our office
len ratingone I don t like school
len ratingfour DO I REALLY HAVE TO JOIN THE MEETING TO USE THE CHAT 
len ratingfour SERIOUSLY DUDE 
len ratingfour IT WAS FINE LIKE A MONTH AGO BUT WHY DID YOU CHANGE THAT BRING IT BACK
len ratingthree in the teams we used to open the videos on stream but some of the videos gets old and got removed from stream so we can see them in the teams recording files but the speed is not change able so please if you see this make it change able i guaranteed you will make a lot of students happier 
len ratingone It keeps on getting me out the app and I m trying to download it back but it is not letting me
len ratingtwo Hi I ve been using the app with my students amp l ve been encountering some issues 
len ratingtwo  When I share my screen amp play videos ss can t hear the sound 
len ratingtwo  I couldn t stop or leave the chat during or after the lesson it s been so annoying 
len ratingtwo The recordedMeetings won t work even though I already downloaded streams I m logged in with the same account as in teamsBut for some reason it still won t work I still can t watch the recorded meetings So hopefully someday they ll fix this problem
len ratingone this app is the reason for my stress and lack of sleep 
len ratingfive The whole platform Teams is excellent you can do everything in one app and it really adds features every time 
len ratingfive This is so good 
len ratingfive One thing to those folks who don t like this mixed assignments app for me it s so good because I can see all assignments which I have to do personally so I don t have to check all classes for assignments 
len ratingfive One tip for those who want assignments divided go to your class team then you will see three menus Posts Files and More Three dot menu after tapping on More Tree dot menu choose assignments there you go 
len ratingfive Best app for teams no but the only problem is that the audio and the screen sharing needs to be fixed ASAP I need to listen to my teachers but I can t because of the audio problems sometime they can t even hear me 
len ratingone I was put into a breakout room and when I clicked return it kicked me out or so I thought 
len ratingone AND THEN MY MIC WAS UNMUTED AS IT PUT ME BACK INTO CLASS 
len ratingone DO NOT INSTALL SUCH AN EMBARRASSMENT 
len ratingone my class heard me scream
len ratingfour I m in th grade and the app is constantly crashing and I m getting blamed for it 
len ratingfive Is there anyway teams can add filters that way some of us can look a little more refreshed during virtual meetings 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams is a great application that I use daily 
len ratingfive Professional and the service is always great for me and the service
len ratingfour It is good but the reason why I m not giving it stars is because it can mess up and go a little crazy 
len ratingone  The app closes continuously in my ipad with iOS 
len ratingtwo Teams used to be great but it s been months since the native iOS call screen stopped showing while on calls which is a huge inconvenience in any environment that requires frequent riding of the mute button 
len ratingtwo And even worse often now when I join calls muted teams is not respecting that choice and is joining unmuted instead which is just about the worst thing a communication app can do 
len ratingtwo If they were complex bugs I might understand but unfortunately these are simple and have been occurring for far too long 
len ratingthree  Great app but could really use CarPlay and Siri support for making calls 
len ratingthree We use Teams with a Calling Plan and I really feel the lack of CarPlay and Siri support 
len ratingthree I also feel like the app is not optimized for voice calls the same way the desktop apps are 
len ratingfour I hate teams it always glitches 
len ratingfive Easy to use and packed with options
len ratingone  So boring ugh didn t not like too much homeworck and so fliping buggy I can t even my teacher
len ratingone Honestly it took me an hour to even set up my account because it kept bringing me to the same page after it made me change my password but the password I changed it to was an old one 
len ratingone Which would have been my only password 
len ratingone Then it wouldn t open teams 
len ratingone It kept bringing me to a page saying I wasn t signed up 
len ratingone And it made me download the app three times on my pc 
len ratingone Honestly if it wasn t for a job interview I would purge this from my computer 
len ratingone  would never use again 
len ratingfive This App is easy to use amp excellent option for work 
len ratingfive Sometimes you just have to have contact with your coworkers amp this really let s you 
len ratingfive Meetings amp files are easy to use and share 
len ratingtwo Much more complicated and less utility than other platforms 
len ratingtwo Fix it pls 
len ratingfive Quick easy efficient 
len ratingfive Teams has everything I need to complete my work day efficiently 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive Teams App is cool because I can message my boyfriend even though he is out in the middle of the ocean for the coast guard 
len ratingfive Great way for me to keep up with work chat all day no matter where I m at 
len ratingfour Lots of neat features for collaboration and virtual work 
len ratingfour  star rating when the desktop app supports toggling through multiple teams 
len ratingfour Anyone who provides services to multiple clients and needs to function in the client s space is really hamstrung by having to constantly sign in and out and by the inability to see all calendar items and meetings in one space 
len ratingfive Great way of communicating for work
len ratingone It has way too many glitches and it always kicks me off the app and it always does this where it will show on my calendar but it will show the wrong teams places I do not recommend it I would try to give it one star so they can t do this to anyone else
len ratingfive Facilitates team projects and sharing documents 
len ratingone Please delete this app because I don t want to do school on here anymore lol 
len ratingfour Microsoft teams is a great app but the thing is every time I have to get on my last class it shows that there s a meeting going on but there s no meeting and it doesn t let me join it every single day and I always have to re download the app please fix thank you
len ratingone Always loses connection for some reason was so late to my interview would not recommend this horrible app My preference would be Zoom 
len ratingfive Absolutely love this app 
len ratingfive I am able to keep in touch with my co workers inside and outside of the office 
len ratingfive I love everything Teams has to offer 
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingone I have used Teams several times with mixed success 
len ratingone I have been able to connect to meetings I have been invited a few times to but failed to get in on many occasions 
len ratingone During my failures I reached the point where the camera and mic are on and the screen says someone in the meeting should let me in soon but nothing else happens 
len ratingone I notified the meeting leader afterwards and was not aware I was waiting 
len ratingone Need to find a way to alert the meeting leader somebody is waiting to get in or something like a Panic button 
len ratingfive Works great
len ratingone Where can mentally challenged people with mental illness get help to understand with help 
len ratingone this app is ruining my mental health
len ratingfive Simple Intuitive Reliable Works 
len ratingone It worked great until the latest update 
len ratingone Now it doesn t give me notifications 
len ratingone It worked great until the latest update and now it just decided to never notify me of a chat until I open the app and click on the chat 
len ratingthree Love Teams but please allow review of chats on Apple Watch 
len ratingone They harass me and I don t like it this isint fair for them to not let me in
len ratingfive My organization tried Slack first and I find this easier to use on mobile especially if I m in a meeting and need to go from my phone to my computer 
len ratingfive I never thought I d use the phrase too easy but it s just that good 
len ratingfour So apparently whenever I try to Join a meeting it redirects me to a pop up that asks if I want to sign in to a different account and if I press no it happens again and this time I press yes and I can t log back in 
len ratingone Any time I join a call it always joins me to the meeting UNmuted 
len ratingone I always select the option to join MUTED but every single time I join a call my microphone is unmuted 
len ratingone This is a major bug that needs fixed immediately 
len ratingfive  SIKE it s stars this is made for learning kids would like it prob better than a lot of apps and more like games u need this app for everything man my small bros teach here like this app is fire mate
len ratingone  I NEED TO SEE MY TEACHER S SCREEN ON THE LAPTOP BUT INSTEAD I JUST SEE LOGOS
len ratingfive Much more convenient then sending and receiving emails 
len ratingfive Quick communication becomes much more intuitive and less frustrating 
len ratingfive The teams app isn t accurate on the status of my profile if I m solely on my app 
len ratingfive I love being connected to my team 
len ratingfive We use the chats to address each area of our business lines 
len ratingfive This allows us to respond quickly and reference back if needed 
len ratingfive This has also eliminated hundreds of emails everyday 
len ratingfive Which has become essential during this past year 
len ratingthree The app taxes the battery more than any of the other apps on my phone including outlook
len ratingfive Love it amazing way to communicate fast especially when having a online meeting thank you
len ratingtwo  For one my account was falsely locked and for second I entered my correct login info and it said it s incorrect 
len ratingone don t ever down load this app when you have a meeting and you want to join on your phone is will not join it says try again later i have to delete and reinstall this app every time 
len ratingone  How can I retrieve my password
len ratingfour Great app but horrible for battery life 
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingthree Was working great until the last update 
len ratingthree Now all users on a mobile device can t access the tasks list we created 
len ratingone I don t like school so yea
len ratingthree I WISH THAT YOU REMOVE THE LAST SEEN
len ratingfour I am a kid and this helps me get into class but I am on a iPad and I can t have a background and that s the only bad this
len ratingfive Is been really helpful for me and my coworkers the security system is really good and is been make it easy for us to conect 
len ratingfive Like this platform because it is an option between phone call and email 
len ratingfive It gives a more conversational feel and are less prone to misinterpretation 
len ratingfive Phone calls don t provide the evidence that communication occurred or an easy way to follow up on things discussed on a call 
len ratingfive If something is discussed in a call I feel the need to recap in an email so the participants myself included can correct something that may have been Mis stated 
len ratingfive In teams I don t have to do the double duty of recapping in email 
len ratingone This app was easy to use efficient convenient and effective for prompt chats on the run and quick log in to meetings 
len ratingone After an update it will not allow chat unless you add another user 
len ratingone It also does not show status of others anymore 
len ratingone It also has a terrible search function now 
len ratingone Regular contacts will not pull up anymore 
len ratingone It s useless now 
len ratingtwo I used this app for school 
len ratingtwo It is good but it always says error when I want to put a profile pic but it never says error when I put a pic that I don t want 
len ratingtwo Also YOU NEED TO LET THE PEOPLE ON IPADS USE VIRTUAL BACKGROUND 
len ratingtwo LIKE JEEZ I AM THE ONLY ONE IN MY CLASS THAT CANT DO THAT 
len ratingtwo DEVS PLS READ 
len ratingone  The interface is difficult to navigate and understand the streaming itself is unstable the PC app straight up doesn t work and its all just overly complicated with less features than anything out there
len ratingfive Easy to use with and organic feel and integrates well with Microsoft product suite 
len ratingthree i have to uninstall then reinstall
len ratingone  Microsoft teams does not properly support Pages documents 
len ratingone It changes font types and does not translate well on the desktop version 
len ratingone I want Microsoft teams to at least convert Pages to Word like Pages is nice enough to convert Word to Pages 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate and find commands 
len ratingtwo I cannot sign in so I can t start a meeting and Quality of the calls are terrible 
len ratingfive Way better than WebEx Teams 
len ratingone  Is very buggy and slow Student
len ratingfive Simple to use 
len ratingfive Makes meetings easy 
len ratingfour I like Teams a lot for work and it has made virtual meetings and messaging a breeze 
len ratingfour I d say visually it is a nice looking app on both iOS and Android 
len ratingfour It has good functionality and calling in from my phone has been a lifesaver especially in instances when my ISP decides to turn off the service in my area while they perform maintenance without any notice of course 
len ratingfour I still feel like each team is limited in what it can do though and wish you could build out channels a bit more 
len ratingfour Within a large team it makes more sense to me to have multiple channels for dedicated conversations about certain topics or projects 
len ratingfour Channels are also great if you want to try and keep certain conversations separate and more focused without necessarily notifying your entire team 
len ratingfour I also still find that the email functionality for channels and larger teams is a bit confusing and hard to find 
len ratingfour I think there are instances when emailing a team channel is preferred over a message and that functionality should be made more accesible and easier to use 
len ratingfour I also think there should be some simpler integration with Sharepoint 
len ratingfour I ve had difficulty trying to create tabs for Sharepoint sites that are not directly connected to the Team I m managing 
len ratingfour At the company I work for many of our internal sites were overhauled into Sharepoint sites which are great but the interconnectivity with those sites and a relevant team is not great 
len ratingfour That said a link to a site is easy to embed and share with people but if you want to have the sharepoint site become a tab within a team it isn t always the best 
len ratingfour All that said I like this app and have seen how powerful of a tool it is for keeping everyone I work with connected especially during this pandemic 
len ratingfour Here s to more functionality and more features in the future 
len ratingone I swear every time there s an update the app evolves backwards year 
len ratingone Now the pictures and toolbar on the bottom stay there no matter what and there s nothing in the settings to turn that off 
len ratingone The screen also times out and the screen goes black if you move your finger or anything else even just holding it there over the proximity sensor on the top 
len ratingone Why would the screen time out on a VIDEO CALL app 
len ratingone There s very little you can do in settings to fix any of these things 
len ratingone This app would actually be half decent if the devs fixed these things but they re aiming it at the larger iPhones with big screens so that big bar that takes up of the screen at all times wouldn t be as noticeable on phones like the iPhone that has a long screen 
len ratingone I have the SE and it s just impossible to use 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive Teams allows a user to connect to one s own team and to connect to other within one s organization 
len ratingfive Also allows to connect with other organizations to allow further collaboration 
len ratingone La verdad no quiero coger clases porfavor vota estrella para que la app cierre odio las clases dale estrella adem s a quien le e gusta coger clases creo que a nadie XD bueno bye v
len ratingfive a feature i like is the zoom feature when someone is sharing their screen
len ratingfive The reason I am writing is that I want a feature that when you tap or click the leave it should ask you that if you really want to leave the meeting please add this because I ve accidentally left meetings several times
len ratingone  everyone that hates school knows what I m talking about so if you hate school rate this app one star 
len ratingone Qu ser lo que se debe hacer para proyectar un video enTeams CON AUDIO se supone que la nueva actualizaci n lo permite desde IPad 
len ratingone Por favor es importante superar este impasse 
len ratingone Estamos frenados
len ratingfive I like this app 
len ratingthree Repeat it was frustrating not being heard on the other end of our conversation again
len ratingfour This is a really good app and I really like it for school sometimes the video quality is a little bad though so that s why I rated stars
len ratingfive I think this is an incredible all in one platform to message share files have video or audio chats give presentations while sharing your screen etc 
len ratingfive I appreciate this app 
len ratingone teachers make everything harder on this app and THATS why I hate school 
len ratingthree Every time I use my phone for meeting it sometimes turns black and it unmutes me by itself and I have a big mouth so I can get in trouble for that but if u work on that it would be a really good app
len ratingfive I love the mobile app especially 
len ratingfive Very well made 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive It s the new way to communicate now that we work remotely 
len ratingfive This is cut down immensely on the amount of emails I sent to my boss and the fact that it has from what I can tell all of the functionality that the desktop version has it makes it very simple to use 
len ratingfive I love the seamless Ness between what are use on my desktop computer and what I use on my phone and or tablet 
len ratingfive I love Teams 
len ratingtwo It s really good for keeping files on porn and illegal websites I am able to keep so many porn links of busty brunettes and I don t lose them 
len ratingtwo However one time it glitches out and I did lose a few links I didn t save which were fine because they wernt even that bad anyways 
len ratingfour Good
len ratingone Like this app is utterly disgusting
len ratingfive This has helped me to talk to my friends online and good for school 
len ratingtwo don t get me wrong i like teams 
len ratingtwo it s really useful for our online classes but sometimes i get unmuted by teachers without me knowing 
len ratingtwo i find that disrespectful because it s an invasion of my privacy at home 
len ratingtwo if teachers want us to participate in class then that s OUR grade and participation 
len ratingtwo that s on us 
len ratingtwo but having to go so low to unmute us without us acknowledging it is so messed up 
len ratingtwo everyone has personal things going on at home and i don t like the idea of teachers being able to hear your personal stuff sometimes because they really do 
len ratingtwo i could be falling asleep just for one class and i ll wake up unmuted with my phone or computer on my table and me sleeping on my bed and i m always home alone too 
len ratingtwo there s no way that s fair 
len ratingtwo my grade is my grade my fault 
len ratingtwo no excuse to listen in on what s going on at my house 
len ratingtwo if i m wrong that teachers can t unmute you then there s still something wrong with the mute button 
len ratingtwo i hope you see this as a wrong and fix this 
len ratingtwo This app is really sometimey it only works to be able to get into meetings when it feels like it 
len ratingtwo I can access the chat but not the live meeting frequently when on the go and having to be on at the same time 
len ratingtwo Very inconsistent 
len ratingtwo And yesterday my whole team was constantly being kicked out of the meetings 
len ratingone I have to use this app for work it is the most convoluted thing I have ever seen 
len ratingone None of my coworkers know how to use it or even like to use it 
len ratingone If you don t have to download this app save yourself the trouble and just use something else 
len ratingfive Love teams wish they would make it easy to forward an attachment or photo to another chat thread
len ratingone Every time I join my classes 
len ratingone My screen goes black and flash sometimes I ve updated teams restarted my device 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I love how I can collaborate inside and outside of my organization in the many different ways available in Teams 
len ratingfive We get better work delivered faster 
len ratingfive Thanks Microsoft 
len ratingone I have to do school and it does not allow me at all so I hate it
len ratingtwo So trash that sometimes I get unmuted any time
len ratingone Overall this is a good app but how is there not an option to follow the system dark mode 
len ratingone This has been around for quite some time and every other Microsoft app is able to do this 
len ratingone This is just plain lazy 
len ratingfive How to fix
len ratingfour I know there is a purpose to having the conversation keep going but I avoid using it for simple conversations that don t need a record 
len ratingfive  We are working from home since pandemic started and Teams saved our world since then 
len ratingfive This app was on our network but no one was paying attention until pandemic hit 
len ratingfive Now we are doing most of conference calls and exchange of information via Teams 
len ratingfive Overall great app and tightly integrated in to office and Microsoft eco system 
len ratingfour This app is awesome 
len ratingfour Super easy and highly effective 
len ratingfour BUT there should be an APPLE WATCH app 
len ratingfour Come on 
len ratingone that s the reason
len ratingfive You can talk to your co workers
len ratingfour App works great 
len ratingone It s great on all other devices except the iPads you get to the sign in screen and it either sends you to your iPad home page or it says signing in for half an hour then doesn t sign in don t recommend
len ratingfour It s a bit slow but good app to use for video calls and voice calls easy to use
len ratingfour I can t see the sharing of my team
len ratingfive I think teams is amazing I
len ratingone I have never even heard of TeAmS 
len ratingfour Seamless and solid interface 
len ratingfour It is my go to productivity app 
len ratingthree I just want to ability to keep my notification settings the same when I log out and log back in 
len ratingthree Further I know Teams does not have the ability to change the time your status is set to away and that would be super beneficial 
len ratingfive MS Teams is a fantastic way of sharing documents and working with Clients and co Workers 
len ratingfive Highly recommend this software 
len ratingone I CANT JOIN MY CLASSES BECAUSE IT KEEPS SAYING TRY AGAIN LATER IT HAS BEEN HOURS AND IT STILL SAYS THE SAME THING I EVEN RESET MY IPAD I EVEN DOWNLOADED IT ON MY PHONE AND IT SAYS THE SAME THING THIS IS ANNOYING AND IT NEEDS TO GET FIXED I DONT KNOW HOW EVERYONE ELSE IS JOINING CLASSES BUT I CANT 
len ratingfour The app itself works great but a huge flaw prevents it from stars and that s the fact that it ll automatically unmute when you enter a meeting despite having the microphone option toggled off 
len ratingfour Please fix this or let it be some kind of default you can set in settings 
len ratingfour I didn t catch it and said something disastrous this morning out loud 
len ratingone  So boring ugh didn t not like too much homeworck
len ratingfive Teams is a great communication app 
len ratingfive Has it all video conference phone call in messenger and easy file transfer 
len ratingfive I really love this app it is very helpful for school very easy to use
len ratingtwo This app worry s me because I get kicked out trying to get into class or in the middle of class 
len ratingtwo I miss a lot from class and can t get my work done because of teams 
len ratingtwo I personally do not like it 
len ratingone  It keeps glitching when I m in classes and my teacher almost never works 
len ratingone Kids will put each other s hands down mute each other and kick people from meetings 
len ratingone The teachers sometimes are able to figure out how to change that by making them an attendee but the teachers that can t always have tons of trouble 
len ratingone It s also really annoying to use on an iPad when I need to be on another tab that you can have both open at once or that it doesn t switch to a small view of who is talking in the corner or something like when you re watching something on a phone 
len ratingfive Some of the lack of functionality from the desktop version are resolved by the phone iPad app 
len ratingfive Best app ever from Microsoft 
len ratingone Siempre me saca de la reuni n por nada y enzima de eso aveces se cierra la aplicaci n mientras estoy en una reuni n 
len ratingfour Great idea great application
len ratingfive Microsoft is definitely late to the game in its collaboration tools 
len ratingfive But they took the time and now have an excellent product 
len ratingfive It handles web meetings eliminating the need for Webex GoToMeeting and zoom 
len ratingfive It handles channels and instant messaging eliminating the need for slack and it does phone calls with person to person calling 
len ratingfive It also lets you share files and allows storage of team documents 
len ratingfive Integrates fully with email uses Azure AD for single sign on the full list of why this product is great is a long one 
len ratingfive Great job Microsoft 
len ratingfour Great 
len ratingfive If you haven t made the switch to Teams what are you waiting for 
len ratingfive Do it 
len ratingfive Teams is great 
len ratingone It s laggy and always kicking me out of the call everytime
len ratingfour The crater need to put background on iPad and phone and 
len ratingfour Teams is good for meeting but it s annoying like people keep sending massages like they are doing like those pictures and funny stuffs crater can u do please wait sec to chat 
len ratingfour Becuse people are keep doing that are not we are doing in class 
len ratingfour And Teams is good 
len ratingfour And great sorry if I am being mean or salty 
len ratingtwo Every time I m using teams for classes on my phone it causes my phone screen to flicker on and off 
len ratingfour Teams has been a great app for supporting collaboration during these unprecedented times 
len ratingfour My only gripe with Teams is that it doesn t work well with AirPods 
len ratingfour For example if I receive a call on Teams while my AirPods are still in their case removing them from the case to use them on the call gives mixed results 
len ratingfour Sometimes the audio will play over my iPad speakers even though the iPad recognizes my AirPods and shows that they are connected 
len ratingfour Also sometimes the audio will cut out completely on both the speakers and my AirPods and I will need to hang up and call the person back 
len ratingfour Reliable AirPods compatibility would make this a star app for me 
len ratingfive Teams is a great tool that we use for work to stay connected share files and collaborate 
len ratingfive It s also great for personal family use as well 
len ratingthree Decent app but disable it if you have a data limit 
len ratingthree It s eaten GB in a week 
len ratingfive This is by far the best collaboration tool out there 
len ratingfive Microsoft really exceeded expectations on this one 
len ratingone Microsoft teams is the worst app to use for meeting family matters and especially school 
len ratingone Teams is slow buggy and VERY annoying to use 
len ratingone Speaking as a student who uses this app around hours a day teams is incredibly buggy 
len ratingone The most notable bug has to be the camera 
len ratingone I have been marked absent multiple times just because team was being buggy and wasn t showing my camera on 
len ratingone It gets very annoying when i have to constantly email my teacher s that I wasn t absent and teams was just showing my camera off 
len ratingone Another huge thing wrong with this app has to be the fact that it s very slow 
len ratingone In almost all my classes my teacher s have to stop at least once a day just because teams is being slow and they can t share their screens 
len ratingone Teams also likes to delete work in the class notebook which can be a very bad thing when I turn in my work and i get a because it shows as blank 
len ratingone Finally this app is just annoying to use 
len ratingone When you use the teams app on your phone it glitches out so everyone on the computer can see your face super zoomed in 
len ratingone I was actually called out by a teacher for not paying attention when I was trying to move my phone away so it wouldn t be so zoomed in 
len ratingone Another huge issue is that when you use this app on desktop and in a browser you can only have teams tabs open this is a huge problem for me since one of them has to be my meeting and you can t do gallery view which is very annoying when it comes to breakout rooms 
len ratingone To sum up what has been stated teams is slow buggy and super annoying to use 
len ratingone  and I would definitely recommend using google classroom 
len ratingfive I love this app when I can walk away from my computer but keep an eye on discussions 
len ratingfive One big critique GIF in chats it s awful and needs an update for variety 
len ratingone It s a great app at first I take online classes on it but it got really weak and doesn t allow me in all the time could be better tbh there is other problems too
len ratingfive Students do not need a second app to get their work done 
len ratingfive More appealing to the students than plain Google Classroom 
len ratingfive  It s not just a video chat app 
len ratingfive It s an actual teaming platform and video is only one feature 
len ratingfive Once you understand that Teams will unlock effeciencies in your organization regardless if you re working in the office or remotely 
len ratingfive There are various subscriptions you can use including free all the way up to a full phone system replacement 
len ratingthree This would be a five star review if this was available as a native app for Apple Watch versus just getting notifications on the Apple Watch 
len ratingthree Microsoft please add native support for Apple Watch 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingfive As somebody who used this app strictly for school purposes and I use my computer for the majority I really enjoyed having this app 
len ratingfive Notifications come in like a text and calls are like a phone call 
len ratingfive Simple and easy to navigate and helpful to have so you re always updated on what s going on in your meetings and chats 
len ratingfive I would recommend the app to any Teams users as it makes it much easier
len ratingone Sorry but I have school on this so I m mad 
len ratingone If the app has less than a star rating it gets rid of the app lets get it down
len ratingtwo Phone heats up a lot while using Microsoft teams
len ratingfive This app helps my coworkers and I share ideas hold meetings and chat so easily and it s fun to use 
len ratingfour I use it for school 
len ratingfive A must have app and video audio quality control is great 
len ratingfive Use it daily for work and it s never let me down 
len ratingfive With COVID this is an amazing tool for students 
len ratingfive Why 
len ratingfive Well a truck of reasons 
len ratingfive Here s best Teams things ideas during COVID 
len ratingfive Best Things 
len ratingfive Assignments 
len ratingfive This is a great tool because students know what they need to complete 
len ratingfive Chat 
len ratingfive Unfortunately some teachers took Chat away 
len ratingfive Nothing to say here but it s great 
len ratingfive  modes for daytime and nighttime 
len ratingfive Nothing to say again but I love them 
len ratingfive Meeting to join from phone iPad 
len ratingfive Join meetings for class from your iPhone or iPad 
len ratingfive BTW I am a student that uses this 
len ratingone  VirtualBackgrounds 
len ratingone VirtualBackgrounds 
len ratingone VirtualBackgrounds 
len ratingone It s been months since the pandemic where is virtual background for iOS teams 
len ratingone How long does it take a Microsoft team engineers to add the feature to add customized backdrop change loop video clip and picture to the phone app 
len ratingone Never 
len ratingone Come on guys it s not that hard to code and it s an important feature to have 
len ratingone Any other group video chat apps out there can do that already 
len ratingone Do you guys really want to wait till the Pandemic is over and then add this feature 
len ratingfive Good stuff
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive This is the best product that Microsoft has ever produced 
len ratingfive The calling the messaging the organization 
len ratingfive I can t say enough about it you just need to get it 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Works great for work teams of all sizes 
len ratingfour  We need to share video sounds when it will be possible in the iPad version 
len ratingfour Still learning the app
len ratingone Garbage
len ratingfive  Silicon Valley 
len ratingthree Sometimes it can be glitchy but overall it s pretty good 
len ratingtwo This is a must have app for work during COVID times 
len ratingtwo The second you connect to car play the head in the car crashes and resets 
len ratingtwo I have tried the same with zoom on carplay and it does not have any issues 
len ratingtwo It seems to me there are bugs in this app with car play integration 
len ratingtwo Other than that this app is great 
len ratingfive The teams app has incorporated all the ease of use items from Skype and WebEx and none of the things that made those apps frustrating to use 
len ratingfive The fact that I can use all my Office tools across the board and all my devices makes this my go to production application 
len ratingfive This is the best app ever five stars 
len ratingfour Hello 
len ratingfour I d just like to write a review on the new update 
len ratingfour I use teams for school and work 
len ratingfour Today it has updated I m not sure if it s part of the update or might be a bug 
len ratingfour I had a problem today on a teams meeting saying Getting Details A few minutes later it said Please try again later I had my teacher call me in since it didn t work 
len ratingfour I had to transfer my meeting from my phone to my laptop 
len ratingfour I love how you can do that but not with that problem 
len ratingfour Please fix this 
len ratingfour If I have any further questions or concerns I ll make sure to edit this 
len ratingfour I don t get why this happened 
len ratingfour Again please fix it 
len ratingfour This review is being written quickly to possibly have this problem fixed 
len ratingfour Please respond 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive Teams is not me of the fewCommunication platforms that offers live captions 
len ratingfive This is a great feature if you re hard of hearing 
len ratingfive Teams god
len ratingfive Best overall business application 
len ratingfive No others can compete 
len ratingthree I like the app a lot 
len ratingthree I use it to chat with some of my friends that go to different schools for school and to contact my teachers 
len ratingthree I just don t like how you have to put your password for your account every single day 
len ratingthree Like can t it just keep me logged in 
len ratingone Aren t there anyway for having a big larger buttons that these buttons we click times and still didn t click exactly on them 
len ratingone What is the point of having an app that redirects me to the web when in fact I can save time and access the app through the web 
len ratingone I always wonder when Microsoft engineers really solve a problem do they think of a problem as a problem or just pretend to be a problem and there s none 
len ratingtwo Hello in the latest version of the Teams update now there is no option to turn off the participants list 
len ratingtwo This means on a Smartphone you have even less space to view screen shared document 
len ratingtwo Do the developers actually use this product 
len ratingtwo Guessing no as now to view the shared screen it is like looking through a port hole 
len ratingtwo Sorry development team you missed this one badly 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Bad connection 
len ratingone Missed classes bc of it 
len ratingone Chat doesn t work sometimes 
len ratingone Just a horrible app 
len ratingone Wish I could give it stars 
len ratingone But then I couldn t warn u about how bad this is 
len ratingone Oh also it uses up ur battery even when ur not using it 
len ratingone In other words 
len ratingone HATE IT 
len ratingone Glad I don t do online school anymore 
len ratingfive Teams is fantastic 
len ratingfive It has become an integral part of our business 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft
len ratingfive I really like the feature that allows me to silence it on a schedule so I m not bothered on my days off but can still easily check on things at my leisure 
len ratingfive I switched our whole company over to teams we love it 
len ratingfive It s so integrated with everything we need 
len ratingfive The only update that would make it even better is to build the planner function inside the teams app instead of having a separate app 
len ratingone Inflexible and counterintuitive 
len ratingfour I m really liking MS Teams and the ease of using it for meetings 
len ratingfour I also like all the easy integration with emails calendars notes tracking from meetings and the chat feature when in a meeting 
len ratingfour My only issue is not being able to delete history notes 
len ratingfour Other than that it is fabulous and very intuitive for end users 
len ratingfive A versatile platform with limitless potential for team building
len ratingfour Would be great if you could create sub channels or channels under an existing channel 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingone I really don t want this app bc it s a math app
len ratingfive Microsoft has knocked it out of the park with Teams 
len ratingfive If you re already using O you ll find seamless integration with email contacts and calendar 
len ratingfive They continue to improve use and functionality 
len ratingfive If you tried it previously and found it wanting give it another try 
len ratingfour Team meeting screen sharing needs to improve allow viewers to zoom in and out
len ratingfive I see a great evolution in this software 
len ratingfive Congratulations 
len ratingfive I would like to suggest an improvement 
len ratingfive When we are in a discussion people raise their hand 
len ratingfive If more than one person raise his hand we do not know who raise the hand first 
len ratingfive My suggestion is to include one number inside the hand that represents the order that the hands were raised 
len ratingone Why did the update take away the ability to present broadcast with split screen 
len ratingone I used to be able to split screen using PowerPoint and MicrosoftWord while presenting and now it s no longer able to do it 
len ratingone When I try to split screen MS Team kicks me off from the broadcast mode what the 
len ratingone Bring back the ability to broadcast in split screen mode 
len ratingone Ever hear of the adage if it ain t broken don t fix it 
len ratingfive Great platform for learning and staying virtually connected 
len ratingone My microphone is picking up a very low volume and all users complain me of speaking far off 
len ratingone Happens only in Teams on IPad 
len ratingone All Webex Zoom is working fine 
len ratingone After today s update on iPad Pro and IPhone both devices have lowered the mic sensitivity to a level where you can almost not be heard on the device 
len ratingone Needs a software bug patch ASAP 
len ratingone My child uses Teams to join class for school 
len ratingone The latest update renders it useless on her iPad as the microphone doesn t work and her teachers can t hear her 
len ratingone Before rolling out updates like this when millions of kids are on myriad devices think about the effect it has on homeschooling 
len ratingone The last thing we wanted to do today was troubleshoot computer issues all day only to find no solution 
len ratingone Some basic testing should ve solved this problem that never should ve happened 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingthree Got offlined on my work laptop and tried to join using the phone 
len ratingthree I was no able to do it as I could not get the link sent to my phone You cannot connect using the meeting key and password as WebEx and Zoom allow
len ratingthree Latest update we are having issues with people being heard had to resort back to Zoom unfortunately 
len ratingfour If my location is changing such as on a train or bus without WiFi It would be good it Teams could suspend WiFi so it doesn t freeze when trying to connect to hotspots 
len ratingone  Not sure if it is the Teams update or the iOS update but now when the sounds of a meeting are played through the device ipad or iPhone the volume is low and others cannot hear me via the mic on the device 
len ratingone Everything works fine when using my AirPods 
len ratingone Really frustrating when trying to listen to a meeting chat on the devices speaker mic 
len ratingone This just started happening 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfour It is much easier to access the link 
len ratingthree You should be able to adjust your status time and should not be put in as away after minutes of non mouse use 
len ratingthree This is misleading when you are not truly away 
len ratingthree Also it would be great to see more faces on the screen at once 
len ratingone Every time I try to join a meeting it says can t connect please try again 
len ratingone Androids app works and it works on a computer 
len ratingone iOS app is garbage 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and reinstalled and it still won t work
len ratingone Audio is very poor on smartphones with the newest update on the th I will now have to hold my phone to my ear to hear while it is one speaker all other applications are fine in this regard it is only teams 
len ratingfour The app is great I believe there s room for improvements with templating 
len ratingfour MS Teams may incorporate a ghost like image on each page software selection of what the information could look like and benefit an organization 
len ratingfour Coming up with creative ideas to display and coordinate data without some guide or capability is and has taken a great deal of time and stress when command wants info and a running system soonest 
len ratingfour The software ppt word excel has been difficult to update using Teams 
len ratingfour Blurry images of the work different methods to write updates using Teams makes it better to just download the item complete the update and upload changes documents back into teams 
len ratingthree The mobile app does not allow multiple photos to be selected for upload they currently must be added one photo at a time 
len ratingthree This makes the app a bit of a deal breaker for field use 
len ratingone bad app smd
len ratingfour As said 
len ratingtwo Idk what happened but as soon as I updated to the new version and opened it the scrolling is lagging SO MUCH 
len ratingtwo It s greatly unbearable 
len ratingtwo FIX IT PLEASE 
len ratingone  I HATE SHOOL 
len ratingfour Good that Teams app offers dark mode but it should offer the ability to just follow the iOS setting 
len ratingfive Since the lockdown back in March we adopted Teams 
len ratingfive My team and I we all work from home as MEP design engineers 
len ratingfive We share drawings meeting notes send messages and of course have video calls 
len ratingfive The Teams app on phone allows all of the capabilities on my phone 
len ratingfive I find it very versatile and highly useful 
len ratingfive I just wish there were ways to just delete some of message streams 
len ratingfive They stay forever and crowd the chats window 
len ratingone The app isn t smart enough to check to see if you have Microsoft s own app Outlook configured as the default mail client 
len ratingone Ironic 
len ratingone Also when you mute a chat you still get the notification sound 
len ratingone I feel like that s the exact opposite of what mute should do 
len ratingthree Pretty good 
len ratingthree Wish Computer app has ability to set up breakout rooms but not on iPhone iPad app 
len ratingthree Please add 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree Ability to PLEASE forcibly mute someone and make that person STAY MUTED for GCC 
len ratingthree Think of the teachers PLEASE 
len ratingthree This already exists on the computer app you just need it for iPad and iPhone 
len ratingthree ALSO ability to send invite for someone to unmute themselves much like in Zoom 
len ratingthree You can request someone unmute themself and it sends them an invite 
len ratingthree Great for less tech savvy people 
len ratingfive I enjoy Teams and easy to use and all in under one umbrella 
len ratingthree It s very slow
len ratingfour I love TEAMS but am often searching for simple accessible user guides 
len ratingfour How do the Outlook Suite Apps interact with one another 
len ratingfour Talk through the differences in Teams channels etc how is it all connected 
len ratingtwo Like most Microsoft apps the UX is terrible 
len ratingtwo Extremely cluttered unpredictable UI that leaves you scratching your head 
len ratingtwo The app in pretty unoptimized and constantly has UI lag 
len ratingtwo I d much rather use Slack if it were a choice 
len ratingfive I love the teams app and it s very easy to use 
len ratingfive Most people have an easy time working with it 
len ratingfive There are two things that need to be fixed however the first is that it needs to link to the contact database in Outlook 
len ratingfive When you go to set up a meeting you can t pull in your contacts if they re not within your company 
len ratingfive This is cumbersome but that s especially for large meetings were you have to go to outlook copy the email go back to teams and then it will invite them 
len ratingfive It does not link to the contacts database 
len ratingfive The second item is that when people come in to the meeting it automatically mute their microphone 
len ratingfive This is troublesome for many people because they can t figure out how to unmute the microphone 
len ratingfive So you spend minutes of the meeting trying to get everybody to unmute their microphones 
len ratingfive If they re not familiar with the software it s hard to find 
len ratingfive Other than that it works very well 
len ratingone Congratulations you guys managed to mess it up 
len ratingone You can t join teams calls of the time anymore on it
len ratingfour Teams is a user friendly easy to nAvigate app 
len ratingfour I recommend it highly
len ratingtwo I am receiving a notice that I have to change my PIN after days 
len ratingtwo I can t change the pin however because the number pad is overlaying the OK button to change the PIN 
len ratingtwo Basically I am no longer able to use my APP on my phone 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingfive Much good
len ratingthree What a terrible update of the latest version teams 
len ratingthree The task cannot be opened from the iOS apps 
len ratingthree I have to use laptop to open the task instead of using the phone 
len ratingthree It is a shame update so inconvenient 
len ratingfive Not as colorful and featureful as slack but looks like a simple app with mostly useful functionality 
len ratingfive No way to reply to specific messages thats a pain 
len ratingfive But having video and chat helps 
len ratingfive Definitely something that can be improved to match up to slack zoom 
len ratingone I WANT THE ANIMATIONS 
len ratingone I DINT HAVE THEM IN SOME STUFF I SPDOJT SEND IN THEI IS TERRIBLE MY ONLY MOTIVATION FOR SCHOOL IS THE ANIMATIONS THEY GIVE ME JOY AND HAPPINESS 
len ratingone PUT THEM IN ALL ASSIGNMENTS
len ratingone It all works fine stop annoying us with your requests for feedback if there s an issue fix it
len ratingone Notications are not received when active on desktop 
len ratingone Yes I have disable the option in the app 
len ratingone It does not work 
len ratingfive Like it better than the PC Version
len ratingfour It is super nice to be able to join Teams function when I am away from my computer 
len ratingfour My only complaint is that whatever chats you have on the mobile app does not sync with your computer interface although it is the same account 
len ratingfour Quando fomos todos pra casa o teams fez toda a diferen a ao longo do tempo temos visto outras ofertas mais sofisticadas mas a integra o com Office ajuda muito 
len ratingfour Espero que a Microsoft continue evoluindo a plataforma 
len ratingfive Stopped using all other chat calling apps excellent tool for office team collaborations
len ratingthree I love the app great stuff but it wouldn t let me join my meeting for class so that was very frustrating and there were dumb things popping up like allow teams to access your microphone or your face can but they already did 
len ratingfive Quick easy and efficient way to communicate 
len ratingtwo Sometimes the app glitches to much even on computer and it really bothers me
len ratingone  This app is amazing and I am studying in it and all but the main problem is that the assignment tab for my IOS is missing 
len ratingone My teachers keep sending assignments there and the tab itself isn t there 
len ratingone What s going on 
len ratingone I need the tab so I can get marks form there too 
len ratingone Creators of Microsoft Teams you need to work on this issue like right now or maybe kids or tweens or teens might lose their marks when they tried to attempt an assignment 
len ratingone This is a problem on my IOS so can you please fix it 
len ratingone It s fine I don t want to do assignments
len ratingfour When I send my work to the teacher via assignment I don t get any animation
len ratingfive Excellent la comunicaci n
len ratingone  I have been trying to get to my meeting but MICROSOFT TEAMS IS KICKING ME OUT ALL THE TIME DONT GET THIS APP
len ratingfour Able to take control in teams app on iOS devices 
len ratingfour Not just share the screen 
len ratingfour Be able to retrieve email address of channel team from iOS software 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingthree Cannot open multiple windows to eat between multiple conversations
len ratingone Portador denle todos sola estrella para que la borren porque no quiere cocer clases
len ratingtwo Before I join a meeting I notice that I am muted and webcam off 
len ratingtwo As soon as I click join and in the meeting I am no longer muted 
len ratingtwo I have to remember to mute myself again 
len ratingtwo This does not happen when I joins from speaker
len ratingfive Teams is a great collaboration tool and has been beneficial for our team to use while working remotely and in the office 
len ratingfive Also the continual improvement of functionality such as the addition of break out rooms is awesome 
len ratingfour So basically I use it for school and other things but it always just kicks me out for no reason now this might sound silly but its true 
len ratingfour PLEASE fix this I cant even get into school bye 
len ratingone Please
len ratingfour The app is very good but it does not have go to particular message feature 
len ratingfour For example if i have a very long chat and if I search something I can easily saw the message in the search result but I cannot go that message easily 
len ratingfour So there should be feature of go to particular message Also the mobile app has reply to message feature but the desktop version does not have such feature at the moment 
len ratingfour Please add reply to message feature in the desktop version 
len ratingthree Its a nice app but there are a lot of glitches and i do teams on an a iPad because of covid and i would like to able to change my background but you can only do that on a Computer 
len ratingone I won t even let me in the app this is so stupid I need to go to school
len ratingone This app is to complicated and glitches far to easily 
len ratingone Many improvements need to be made 
len ratingone Zoom is less sophisticated and runs much smoother at this point glitches in this system are a casualty 
len ratingfive The only thing I would change is being able to go backwards and more than a week forward on the calendar 
len ratingfive Sometimes we need to look at prior appointments meetings 
len ratingfour Still getting to know Teams app but it s a great addition to the desktop for my use 
len ratingfour I d love it if I could switch back and forth a connection from the app to the computer 
len ratingfour I ll keep watch for this feature 
len ratingfour It would make the app a magnificent partner to the on computer access 
len ratingone After joing and leaving a meeting for the first time I cannot join the same meeting again The meeting icon at the rigth of the teams name is still appearing as for the meeting is still going but i cannot join again Please fix this problem on iphone And for sure running the latest ios if that matters Otherwise on windows or any other os this issue is not appearing
len ratingfour  Freezes sometimes when open a chat 
len ratingfour Helps to close app and reopen or wait for sec and app unfreezes 
len ratingfive  Really good
len ratingfive THANM YOU TEAMS
len ratingfive Finally a Microsoft app that is truly device agnostic 
len ratingfive I ve found this app on iOS and MacOS to be identical to the PC versions at work 
len ratingfive This makes the experience very consistent across iPhone iPad MacBook Surface Dell etc 
len ratingfive which is a long time coming 
len ratingfive Now only if Microsoft can get Outlook to the same parity level 
len ratingfive  I love Teams because you do so many things with it
len ratingfour Love this platform but I wish there were more trainings and or tutorials 
len ratingfour Thank you
len ratingfive The TEAMS APP WORKS OUT WELL 
len ratingfive The more that I use it the friendlier it is to me 
len ratingfive Still learning 
len ratingone I ve been using Teams for years and I loved it 
len ratingone But recently Microsoft decided to force users to share their phone number in order to log in 
len ratingone There s no way to log in without giving Microsoft your phone number and I refuse to give up my personal information 
len ratingone Sadly I will have to stop using the app but luckily there s always Slack 
len ratingone It lags a lot and I don t like school so lol sorry 
len ratingfour  Ok teams is great and everything was working fine until something happen teams used to let me in my classes but one day I couldn t join my th period class and I still can t the join button isn t there nor the meeting but the meeting was there and no my classes no longer use the calendar so all I want is for me to be able to join all my classes 
len ratingone Ok this is very bad and should not be even used everything is laggy and buggy it s just bad 
len ratingfour Very intuitive and easy to use navigate
len ratingone Whyyyyyyyyyy
len ratingone Teams no longer works on my iPad 
len ratingone It ends up crashing every time I try to click the calendar button 
len ratingthree Come on 
len ratingthree On the POST tab you can add a post and use the camera 
len ratingthree But not on the FILES tab 
len ratingthree You can add a photo from your device but not take a Live Photo 
len ratingthree This is needed for using the camera as a scanner right to a folder 
len ratingthree You can do this via OneDrive but is a bunch of extra work 
len ratingthree Please 
len ratingone Private chat only works with teachers and admin etc and students can have their chats viewed and punished that s why some use rd party chat things nd the chat in a group chat is horrible and make people lag even with great internet please add a feature to erase all of the chats in both private and in the actual teams channels so it can clear all those texts that are useless after the day has passes thank u
len ratingone So you re telling me I can t turn in my minute assignment on teams and other people can turn in a minute assignment this is my final project and I can t even send in my work 
len ratingone You better fix this because I m am NOT planning to fail my class 
len ratingone Tremenda porquer a de aplicaci n estoy asiendo un examen y ya cuando lo voy a terminar se borro todo hora de mi vida gastada Gracias team
len ratingone I stupidly accepted iOS app update to release even though everything was fine 
len ratingone Now i can t see or send video and I get an error message that won t go away saying your org only allows video sharing over WiFi Even though I m on my home WiFi and cellular data is turned off 
len ratingone Why did you do this 
len ratingone Constant crashes 
len ratingone Nothing but zoom 
len ratingfive Great app but it crashes when you have bad internet connection but it is great
len ratingfive Microsoft has finally designed a simple solution to collaborate with my colleagues without leaving the Microsoft ecosystem and thus exposing the firm to security threats 
len ratingfive Well done Microsoft 
len ratingfive Helps me stay connected
len ratingfour This is a very good app when I was in lockdown and can t go to school 
len ratingfour I can do homework online and can chat with friends 
len ratingfour But 
len ratingfour There is one problem whenever it comes to meetings it gets very laggy and I can t even hear my teacher plz fix this
len ratingfive The Teams App allows you to have reliable business meetings with co workers 
len ratingfive It has the latest features with incredible picture quality 
len ratingfive I ve used other communication apps and this has been the best by far 
len ratingone Fix bugs and stop giving us ui changes let us get used to the already existing ui 
len ratingone Maybe use that time to try and fix some bugs
len ratingthree  As the second best company in the universe next to Apple I would expect better 
len ratingthree There is one thing I m going to actually mention since there are other problems but I don t have time now 
len ratingthree The one problem is my assignments are organized in the worst way possible 
len ratingthree There needs to be more than just completed and assigned I need filters also PLZ STOP PUTTING ASSIGNMENTS I HAVE ONLY READ AND NOT EVEN COMPLETED OR SUBMITTED INTO THE COMPLETED CATEGORY 
len ratingthree It is the most annoying thing I have ever seen I m disappointed 
len ratingfour Hi there are just some issues 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfour I like it though and I like online learning 
len ratingfour I love it though except for the first part
len ratingfour I am currently transitioning away from Basecamp 
len ratingfour I am an avid user of Office 
len ratingfour The Microsoft Planner Ecosystem is a no brainer and worth a look 
len ratingfour I think the integrations are mind blowing and the opportunities in the future even more so 
len ratingfour I hope COVID makes them follow through on it 
len ratingfour Still looking to see if I can setup recurring tasks 
len ratingfour So far so good 
len ratingfour Teams is an awesome app I need this for school but LAG it just makes this app horrible its awesome but when I use chat it just makes thing hard for me I can t do anything but listen to my teacher talk an when I quit it keeps on going when the app is closed how crazy is that 
len ratingfour Anyways it s solved by completely shutting down my computer yeah you heard computer anybody tell me who doesn t use them these days but on my tablet it s not half bad but it s still slow but the good thing about the app is that it s useful and helps with many things as will but on lag teams zoom I think that zoom would win cause it doesn t freeze as much as teams but overall it s a good app
len ratingfive I loooooovvvvvveeeee teams it is awesome for online school
len ratingfour Well I have virtual school 
len ratingfour I can t go into real school or I will get COVID 
len ratingfour So with Microsoft teams I am able to call in with my class and teacher and learn 
len ratingfour The bad part is it sometimes messes up my computer and breaks my microphone 
len ratingfour So that s why I gave it stars instead of 
len ratingthree Great app Only issue is the away status doesn t always sync with the desktop app 
len ratingfour  Hello 
len ratingfour I d just like to write a review on the new update 
len ratingfour I use teams for school and work 
len ratingfour Today it has updated I m not sure if it s part of the update or might be a bug 
len ratingfour I had a problem today on a teams meeting saying Getting Details A few minutes later it said Please try again later I had my teacher call me in since it didn t work 
len ratingfour I had to transfer my meeting from my phone to my laptop 
len ratingfour I love how you can do that but not with that problem 
len ratingfour Please fix this 
len ratingfour If I have any further questions or concerns I ll make sure to edit this 
len ratingfour I don t get why this happened 
len ratingfour Again please fix it 
len ratingfour This review is being written quickly to possibly have this problem fixed 
len ratingfour Please respond 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone This app is terrible
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingfive So so so so so so coool you can change the background 
len ratingone It is frequently showing blank screen when try to open 
len ratingfive Teams has multiple avenues of communication and all are smooth 
len ratingfive Group chats video chats call chats I mean it just allows you to stay in the loop and be present no matter where you are or how you communicate 
len ratingfive The pandemic has me working from home even though my job requires team effort 
len ratingfive With teams I can stay connected with the team and produce deliver our product 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Recommend to all 
len ratingone LAS MAESTRAS NO ME DEJAN VIVIRRRR 
len ratingone  i hate it sm
len ratingtwo I cannot join any meetings 
len ratingtwo When I tap on join black screen appears and nothing happens 
len ratingfour So good 
len ratingfour It was awesome I am using it for school
len ratingone No me gusta la escuela y tieniendo esto mientras estamos en Covid para mi es malo si se supone que sea bueno pero para mi no me gusta y es que es malo soooooooooo odio la escuela todo tipo 
len ratingone  out of ten wouldn t recommend
len ratingone I hate teams also online school
len ratingone Just use ducking zoom the UI is terrible assignments don t submit rummaging through folders is the most annoying thing on earth and last but not least YOU DONT GET NOTIFICATIONS FOR ASSIGNMENT stars
len ratingfive Assignment sometimes doesn t appear to the students even though it seems to has been sent and even the feedback of that assignment doesn t show it appears to be caused by internet connection even if it s poor for a second Add this option please Please add the option that the recorded meeting can only be downloaded by the owner by default and the owner can change that after class
len ratingone  I use this app for online school and I hate it like no
len ratingfour I really love this app but I wish they could make it so that I call call without internet and be able to create my own badges and be able to text during meetings on iOS devices 
len ratingfour But seriously download teams as soon as you finish reading this 
len ratingfive The connectivity creativity and collaboration made available by Teams makes this a valuable tool 
len ratingone It s always laggy when I do my school work and the calls are always glitchy that I can t hear my teachers I know it isn t my phone because it s a new model and it works smoothly for google classroom and etc they really need to work on this
len ratingfour Skipe was better 
len ratingone Microsoft can only make a good product when they charge you for it 
len ratingone I can t afford the Microsoft package but I had an interview via Teams so I had to try and get their free version 
len ratingone The process for getting Teams for free is fraught at best 
len ratingone I tried to download Teams for free and was prompted by the app to instead download Skype 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone That does not make any sense 
len ratingone That is not what I need 
len ratingone I just need Teams 
len ratingone After downloading on Teams on my phone and then syncing the app to my computer I was almost ready to go but then Teams couldn t pair with my computer camera 
len ratingone It was too late to troubleshoot and just had the interview without video 
len ratingone I still can t get the app to pair with the computer camera 
len ratingone Microsoft products are all in all poor unless you pay and they incompatible with Mac s even when you do pay 
len ratingone Don t get this app unless you want to piss off everyone you know 
len ratingone Just use Zoom 
len ratingone It s better 
len ratingfour I am wondering if we have the option for Full Screen View similar to Desktop options through Mobile app 
len ratingfour And is there an option to pass controls to other users while presenting the content over the meeting 
len ratingfive Thanks to Microsoft
len ratingfive Smooth as silk 
len ratingone Their is no controls on the Lock Screen you are not able to mute hold and other controls 
len ratingone it will not let me sign in it said not here sorry and i refreshed anns refreshed
len ratingfive I wrote this a star but it s actually for me bc it made my iPad go completely dead 
len ratingfive Whilst it was on b I got on to teams it was on when I got off of it 
len ratingfive  out of 
len ratingfive Don t have the full functionality of the desktop app but it s still great to use and keep my work at work while still accessing work away from work 
len ratingone WHY in the world isn t there just a button to join a meeting with conference ID it is the whole point of the app and you failed to even have that 
len ratingfour Would like to see a just chat app honestly 
len ratingfour Also would like to see alot more notification options 
len ratingfour Corporate it means we have to drop chat apps that we had been using trying to moveto this 
len ratingfour Ie I want specific chats to notify differently email differently 
len ratingfour I want to be able to have very large team chats and thread but i dont want to be altered the same as one on one or small chats or specific channels 
len ratingone I liked teams before but the new update is really confusing and bad
len ratingfive With Touch of my fingers I can fix my meeting and organize them 
len ratingfive Br B Rojas Chief Nursing Officer
len ratingone U have trash servers
len ratingthree There are a lot of words when typing a message in teams not in dictionary 
len ratingthree Can the words be added in a customized dictionary so the words are not redlined 
len ratingone laggy and never works for a full class so many technical issues 
len ratingone update i get kicked out a few times a day and now teachers can unmute students
len ratingthree Robust capability occasionally bogs down other system apps 
len ratingthree Sharing individual apps as opposed to whole screen causes occasional issues so it s best to share entire screen but makes note taking difficult if you only have one monitor 
len ratingone  ios hnak mushkilat fi almusharakat fi alhalqat fi alnasi al iiftiradii tahdith altatbiq bima yatawafaq mae nizam iOS 
len ratingfive It s super ok 
len ratingfive I like this app 
len ratingfive Good job 
len ratingfive It works good 
len ratingfour Dear MS Teams team working on MS Teams 
len ratingfour Please take a spin through Zoom app one day then take note of all their user friendly options then press CNTR C and COPY that into Teams 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingfive I have really enjoyed using this app 
len ratingthree Umm I am a student and the call feature doesn t work so I am really disappointed
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Can t even get in my daughters class because There app is frozen
len ratingfive Veery good app
len ratingthree I am not able to access video calls or calendar on mobile 
len ratingthree I used to have access to it but I don t anymore I ve tried logging out and back in and even re downloading 
len ratingfive It takes a very short time to understand that teams is the Best app for corporate use it has so many features and enables different communication techniques on top it has very innovative solutions all this in a very user friendly interface 
len ratingfive I highly recommend teams 
len ratingfour While using this app on iOs iPhone XS the phone becomes very very hot i have to shutdown the phone to let it cool down after the call is done 
len ratingfour This app also consumes lot of battery power 
len ratingfour The app is a breeze to use love all the features and it keeps getting better
len ratingone  This is what today s developers and system administrators want now since they are unwilling and unable to do their work because it s so complex for them to actually work and earn their paycheck 
len ratingone Instead they ve decided to take the easy route and have the user do their job while claiming it s validates and makes the app or OS more secure this way than to come up with a real solution for network security 
len ratingone It s not a user s job to do a sysadmin s job so put down that coffee and your smartphone and actually do your job 
len ratingthree  Teams is fine 
len ratingthree The only issue I have is not being able to set the Away Inactive timer 
len ratingthree It seems to be set as a default minutes without any keyboard activity 
len ratingthree This should be a user timing preference 
len ratingthree Even AOL Messenger had it 
len ratingone The new updated version doesn t allow the meeting to begin with you silenced 
len ratingone Annoying 
len ratingone I would rated it but it wouldn t let me IT LAGS EXTREMELY SLOW but I have to use it cuz of my school I mean I WOULD USE GOOGLE MEET instead of this bull 
len ratingone My classmates keep on saying I can t see your screen or your screen s frozen so if you re a school teacher and you want to use teams use google meet
len ratingone I was using this app for school I was talking to my mom while the bottom said I was muted yet my teacher could hear me 
len ratingone I am disappointed and embarrassed 
len ratingone Do better 
len ratingtwo Still have a black screen when I speak to my doctors pretty rough app apparently I wrote a review before thanksgiving still having same issue please fix thanks
len ratingthree I followed the steps under Notifications gt Help gt Troubleshoot Notifications but it shows steps for previous version 
len ratingthree I use desktop version as well concurrently 
len ratingthree Sometimes I get sound notification sometimes not w o changing settings 
len ratingthree So random
len ratingtwo Would be great but it constantly shows a checkbox in chat when there shouldn t be a check 
len ratingtwo I can verify on PC that all chats have been responded to 
len ratingtwo Really annoying bug that has been discussed for several years but not fixed in the app 
len ratingone You guys don t have a suggestion or support page so I ll ask here add a way to permanently set a persons voice level 
len ratingone It s very irritating having to constantly readjust volume especially since teams doesn t stay independent from phone or computer volume
len ratingone  THIS IS A BAD FOR KIDS MY SON FOUND A GIRL AND THEY STARTED DATING 
len ratingone The only reason why I m forced to use this is because it s a bundle with our agencies enterprise license 
len ratingone It continuously joins me unmuted to meetings wile others are presenting in agency wide presentations even though I have it set not to do that and have never unmuted during such meetings 
len ratingone It also on occasion doesn t let me join meetings in progress because the JOIN button is awol 
len ratingone Where did it go 
len ratingone I don t know 
len ratingone I don t have these particular issues on PC but mobile sure does and they have been present for months 
len ratingone Who does QA for Microsoft these days 
len ratingone Not professionals apparently 
len ratingfive This works so much better than the app on my pc
len ratingthree Ive noticed that since the update of teams of the iOS App there is a change in the Call Lock screen now 
len ratingthree If you re on a teams meeting via your iPhone you can no longer lock your phone and use the phone controls for the meeting mute hang up etc 
len ratingthree thus requiring you to go back into the app to mute yourself or hang up from the call 
len ratingthree This was very helpful before can we get this back 
len ratingone  Shuts down if necessary to switch Apps to respond to an email or text 
len ratingone As a comparison Google Meet keeps running in background if I switch apps
len ratingfive Typically I wouldn t write a review on a software for work but this app has been a huge benefit while working remotely the past months 
len ratingfive The team can easily stay connected 
len ratingfive We hold all internal meetings through Teams 
len ratingfive The sound and video quality are excellent 
len ratingfive My favorite function is that the app sends alerts to my Apple Watch for new messages if I stepped away 
len ratingfive This alerts me if there is something important to return back to 
len ratingfive I have loved the app and the desktop application 
len ratingfive I m glad my company made the switch to Teams from Skype for business long before COVID hit 
len ratingone  Esta aplicaci n es mal sima no la usen 
len ratingone Its bad i got scammed and my information robed
len ratingone This is a work app for a majority of users 
len ratingone Make it easier for users to sign out 
len ratingone I can t count how many times I am bothered after work by people to do something because they see that I m signed in even if my status is Away 
len ratingone In order to sign out I have to make two or three button presses more than necessary 
len ratingone  Sign out should be a menu option in the hamburger menu on the first button press 
len ratingone I should have to go on some misadventure to get off this stupid app everyday 
len ratingone I hate the breakout rooms it would be better if you just deleted them 
len ratingtwo I suspect Teams is the best of the various team chat collaboration whatever apps out there unfortunately that s not a very high bar to clear 
len ratingtwo Their dark mode support is a bad joke the number of notifications on the badge has only a passing relationship to the number of unread notifications in the app and I ll occasionally wind up replying to completely the wrong conversation because unlike every other messaging app in existence highlighted in the list of conversations doesn t actually mean is the conversation you have open all of the time 
len ratingone Why are you ugly why are the emojis so ugly they re just weird and they look like they re so ugly 
len ratingone I don t care
len ratingone i hate it lol bye
len ratingfour Make personal groups stand out more Like skype for business was
len ratingfour For the life of me I don t know why there is no Delete function for old chats 
len ratingfour Hide is the only option 
len ratingfour Kind of idiotic not to have that feature available
len ratingtwo Getting an error File Upload Failed 
len ratingtwo Something Went Wrong when trying to upload photos taken by my iPhone s same device camera 
len ratingtwo Tried restarting the app and different folders but no luck 
len ratingtwo Devs please fix this 
len ratingone Teams is always working slow for me and I know it is NOT my computer or WIFI but the app itself 
len ratingone Please do not download this app 
len ratingone Deserves that one star gt 
len ratingfive This app is very convenient to have 
len ratingfive I am still able to work and meet without having my computer in front of me at all times 
len ratingthree If my teams is focused on my computer why is my phone being blasted with notifications 
len ratingthree Do none of you use this product 
len ratingfive App is solid let s me see my friends virtually quality is amazing sound amazing
len ratingfive Sync could be improved sometimes I come back to my computer after being away and there are messages that I did not receive on my phone but it works well the majority of the time 
len ratingfive Best Microsoft product in a long time 
len ratingfive I think this is a very wonderful application multiple ways to communicate and very informative 
len ratingone This app is just the worst it is always crashing on my laptop it is always unresponsive and not to mention everytime you log in it makes you reenter your password
len ratingone it lags and sometimes crashes me out of school calls 
len ratingone and just now today it won t let me login to my school account even though i have the right password 
len ratingone also sometimes it doesn t even work for teachers too 
len ratingone Even when it is working it toggles around attempting to authenticate the user 
len ratingone Whatever the latest update now it refuses to load 
len ratingone Had to reinstall to get it to work but it has stopped working once again 
len ratingthree Ever time I try to login with my school email it says that I doesn t exist 
len ratingthree Like it works for my iPad but not my phone 
len ratingthree I hope that this is fixed 
len ratingone  Sorry if I m acting like a Karen but I don t have calendar which means I can t go on calls if this is a bug please try to help I have school in the morning and I don t wanna miss the lesson
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft for this intuitive product that s helping to connect with colleagues during these difficult times like COVID 
len ratingfive Exploring more day by day 
len ratingfour La versi n de la app mobile no es igual a la de app escritorio por ejemplo en el chat en mobile si se pueden responder comentarios espec ficos y en la de escritorio no 
len ratingfour Deber an tener las mismas funcionalidades
len ratingfive Like
len ratingfive I really like the app 
len ratingfive It slows me to work from anywhere 
len ratingfive App is super easy to use and transitions from computer to mobile quite seamlessly 
len ratingfive App has commensurate functionality to desktop version 
len ratingtwo  You cannot Teams call somebody and share your screen at the same time 
len ratingtwo It works for a Teams meeting but not a Teams call 
len ratingtwo As soon as you share your screen the audio drops as soon as you reconnect audio the screenshare stops 
len ratingtwo  This feature was removed two months ago You can no longer see a Teams call from your lockscreen 
len ratingtwo When somebody is screensharing you cannot lock your phone so the screenshare stops using tons of battery data while still being able to mute unmute 
len ratingtwo All other video chat apps I ve used handle this fine 
len ratingtwo  This app shows the last names of the people on your call and does not show first names 
len ratingtwo All you want is first names 
len ratingtwo It shows you everything you don t want to see and nothing you do want to see 
len ratingtwo  The video call button is way too close to the bottom left corner of the app so people constantly accidentally press it 
len ratingtwo Having this happen at the wrong time could cost you your job 
len ratingtwo  As a safeguard you can disable camera access in Settings gt Teams gt Camera however it will immediately drop your call 
len ratingtwo If you need to share video and re enable it it will drop your call again 
len ratingone As much as I think this app is good there s this bug going on for a long time 
len ratingone When I set my status to out of office I still keep receiving notifications 
len ratingone I even have an automatic reply in outlook and I still get notifications on Teams 
len ratingone Please MS fix this before you make me pull my hair out 
len ratingone This app is really slow 
len ratingone My son Adam was helping use this for a meeting with my family and i don t recommend
len ratingthree It s funny when new the TEAMS platform was wow 
len ratingthree Now it s an expected tool and I am noting Zoom as faster and more nimble 
len ratingthree TEAMS is not as clear fast or market adopted 
len ratingthree Yet it still has a great file share and easy I m immediate video calls 
len ratingfive Teams is a great software 
len ratingfive It s simple to learn and offers a range of different things to play with 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfour It s a good app 
len ratingfour Easy to communicate with the team 
len ratingfour Although placing the log out feature in settings instead of just under the user icon is a mistake 
len ratingfour It creates a lot of people not logging out and thus miss communication because people are communicating from an individual s account that is not their own 
len ratingfour I propose in the next update that the software engineers place the logout button in the drop down that the user finds when they click the user icon 
len ratingfour  This app is really good you can host a meeting and all sorts of stuff doesn t lack of features 
len ratingfour I recommend it for work business and maybe even gaming 
len ratingfour One technical problem is I work on my iPad so I can t type in the chat and when I go on my computer to check it lets me type so I definitely recommend working on a computer 
len ratingfour And another is that on ipad I can t change my background so that is also why you should work on a computer 
len ratingfour But overall I recommend this app 
len ratingone Whenever it s class time my friends can get into the call but the call never shows up in my feed and I ve tried several times to get it to show up but it doesn t 
len ratingfour This app is sooo smart 
len ratingfour But there is a problem 
len ratingfour The raise your hand to speak is glitching so much 
len ratingfour But how 
len ratingfour  here is how when my teacher allow this she wants to unmute each girl 
len ratingfour But it is sooooo laggy 
len ratingfour There are or girls that it doesn t allow them to unmute 
len ratingfour And I am one of them so please can you fix this bug 
len ratingfour But the app is super smart and cool 
len ratingfour So If you fix this bug this app will have stars review 
len ratingone Some times here and there are bugs that kick me out my classroom for no dang reason so I just have to sit there every day fixing that problem
len ratingone I use this for school and let s get to the problems now of the time they don t notify you about the calls and going to do anything is so confusing and when you join a of the time you re phone s screen is gonna go black every seconds and because of that you can t tell the teachers you re answer when they ask you a question there s a lot more problems this application has
len ratingfive Great collaborative software that allows teams to communicate easily across huge distances 
len ratingfive I deal with my team from around the world from South Africa India Vietnam etc 
len ratingfive Thank you very much for giving me an ability to communicate with my people across the globe 
len ratingone for students it a bed app
len ratingfive It becomes educational tool for us I don t understand the security issue Whatever it is I trust in Microsoft 
len ratingfour We desperately need this available on the Mac
len ratingone Not good
len ratingone  I hate this song it is the worst thing ever do not download the other reviews are Lies The app is actually 
len ratingone  Why would you want to prevent users from downloading screenshots pasted in the chat 
len ratingone What are you trying to achieve by doing so 
len ratingone Microsoft please fix your app I can t even sign in to my work or school account keeps saying sign in error please try again MICROSOFT FIX THIS 
len ratingone  Indefinitely spinning loading icons 
len ratingone There is no support 
len ratingone Stay away from this pile of 
len ratingfive Really like teams
len ratingfive Able to do multiple functions such as presenting easy to set up quick meetings with colleagues 
len ratingone For the last eight months I couldn t open the app on the first attempt 
len ratingone The app would force close shortly after freezing when I tried to do anything 
len ratingone And would work fine after opening a second time 
len ratingone Now the app will turn on my mic when I join meetings even when I had my mic toggled off before joining 
len ratingone This is a major privacy concern and needs to be address immediately 
len ratingone The engineering team will disregard feedback when they can t replicate the problem themselves and even when screenshot are provided 
len ratingone It s a well it works fine for me remediation that they really need to stop 
len ratingfour I like Microsoft Teams for IOS 
len ratingfour In the MacOS and Windows versions there is such thing as a meeting Picture in Picture but in the IOS version there isn t 
len ratingfour Can you add that 
len ratingfour That would be a better way to collaborate 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingfive I use Teams on my phone tablet and PC 
len ratingfive It provides the functionality I need anywhere I go 
len ratingone This is the worst app ever if you re looking to use it for school 
len ratingone The App is to slow has so many glitches and doesn t even do what I want it to do
len ratingthree I have to use teams for work so it s hard to have strong feelings about it 
len ratingthree The application is fine enough and gets the job done 
len ratingthree Unfortunately the notifications are completely unhelpful 
len ratingthree Notifications can basically be on or off either completely annoying or I m missing messages 
len ratingthree You can manage it per channel and set up quiet hours for when you re not working but those features still don t address a problem of eliminating distractions during the day 
len ratingthree We need some type of snooze notifications for when a rapid fire conversation starts that doesn t need immediate attention 
len ratingthree Right now you can toggle to silent notifications in iOS but if I don t remember to turn them back on in a timely fashion I ll miss something super important 
len ratingthree Ideally I m notified for a new message I can determine if the conversation is something that needs my immediate attention if not I could hit a snooze button m m h to quiet notifications for that specific chat group while my colleagues talked 
len ratingthree  after the snooze expired I would receive the next notification That would totally help me manage my attention and priorities 
len ratingone Has many problems with meets and other things 
len ratingone I have to use this for school and it is horrible compared to any other apps i have used 
len ratingone It takes forever to load even with good internet and has horrible graphics 
len ratingone Audio and Video quality are terrible on the meets 
len ratingfour i was trying to join my meeting but it wasn t letting me get out of another app i had opened and i tried turning it off 
len ratingfour It was still not working 
len ratingthree Sometimes a meeting will be started and some of of the participants won t be able to see the meeting at all 
len ratingthree For example history class Before you open the history team you see the video icon meaning there s a call meeting in progress 
len ratingthree Once the team is clicked there s no meeting 
len ratingthree Other participants have been able to join and they have no issues but some don t see the meeting at all 
len ratingthree The chat for the meeting will pop up once those in the call start using it but even still the meeting isn t showing up 
len ratingthree I missed an hour of class because of this and all I can hope for is that it s not the same on Monday 
len ratingone Each time I join my meeting it kicks me straight out or not let me even join 
len ratingone When I open the chat it kicks me out 
len ratingone It annoys me soooo much 
len ratingone It sends my messages twice or just spam 
len ratingone Definitely don t recommend 
len ratingone Ok it takes an entire hour to connect to a meeting with a brand new ipad and brand new wifi garbage delete this or fix your trash
len ratingthree I hate all fhings MSFT They ve been popping out chrome plated turds for so many decades but I can t deny that Teams has been ridiculously easy and user friendly both desk top and mobile on my iPhone 
len ratingthree As the famous line goes it just works 
len ratingfour As a student doing online distance learning this has been extremely helpful and have run into very little issues but am overall satisfied 
len ratingfour But one issue I have is that we can t change our names 
len ratingfour I know multiple students who use different names and pronouns and it can be very stressful for them to see their dead names on the screen and students and teachers accidentally using them instead of the names they go by 
len ratingfour If there could be an option to be able to change our names so people can stop seeing the dead names and see the names they go by it can be extremely helpful for everyone to stop using their dead names 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingthree First of all this app was easy for me to use and join all my online classes 
len ratingthree But today is different 
len ratingthree When I tried to join my class it said I had to put my mic settings on I checked the settings and the mic option wasn t there 
len ratingone I downloaded Teams for when I had to do school online 
len ratingone It was good and everything went smoothly until now 
len ratingone For some reason the chat suddenly disabled and I couldn t chat anymore 
len ratingone I had thought it happened with everyone else but the other students could still chat 
len ratingone I find the really offensive because I m a mobile user and I find this unfair 
len ratingone Also it is really laggy when we try to talk while others are behind and others are ahead 
len ratingone Even my teachers are getting tired with it and are considering we use Zoom once again 
len ratingone You also tell us at the end of every meeting to say what was the problem and if anything should be fixed 
len ratingone But then the next day nothing has changed 
len ratingone I m sorry if I sound bratty or anything but this is the only app that I can do my classes on and it would be terrible if something changed because of that 
len ratingone  No more teams
len ratingone  Yea
len ratingfive excellent for work communications 
len ratingfive becomes a huge part of your work life pretty seamlessly
len ratingfive Yea
len ratingthree The sound quality can be highly variable from call to call 
len ratingthree Still get unacceptable levels of drops 
len ratingfive Nicely integrated calling and video chat features 
len ratingfive Let s me transfer from phone to computer and can message chat on the go 
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingfour So I have had years experience with Microsoft teams it is good but anything good has flaws like the it s adaption of zoom It is good but confused me and glitches are apparent 
len ratingtwo I ve had nothing but trouble using this on my iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo Super buggy 
len ratingtwo I either can t access the control panel to unmute mute etc 
len ratingtwo or the share screen does not come through when others use that function 
len ratingtwo No bueno 
len ratingfour They have some network latency issues to work out but it does the job 
len ratingfour The calendar integration is pretty useful 
len ratingfive I love this app so much
len ratingone Ever time I use this app I get kicked and it doesn t work for me
len ratingone  This app trash all we do is be on screens with our mic muted sometimes KIDS listen all we need to do is report and star this app and it will disappear that s allllll 
len ratingone But it s lame nothing to do and it s not helpful for children 
len ratingtwo  Why is the meeting controls and the gallery always on the screen when viewing shared content on an iPad 
len ratingtwo Give me options to hide this unnecessary garbage when I actually need to view the shared content instead you waste of the screen 
len ratingtwo The only view options are gallery or together no wonder why Zoom wins repeatedly over this me too product 
len ratingfive I used it twice for my job 
len ratingfive Works good good connection 
len ratingfive Good sound 
len ratingfive So far it has met all my expectations
len ratingone  Worst program I have ever seen alway glitches and never wanna work get me in trouble for being late because stupid teams doesn t want to work an last but now least I make be have to go to school online
len ratingfive  Conversation similar to WhatsApp 
len ratingfive Just to give an idea 
len ratingfive  Also the ability to cleanup the chats in a conversation without showing it as deleted but leave an option to retrieve within the conversation 
len ratingfive Auto archive feature for group chats 
len ratingfive Meeting invite directly from Teams group
len ratingfour It s a great and flexible tool but as always a Microsoft product lacks polish 
len ratingfour It has many bumps that could complex the ux 
len ratingfour After all it s a very compelling product 
len ratingfour I like this for quick convenient chatting but sometimes file sharing is complicated and tricky and it would be awesome if I didn t have to pop out the window to get the attach link 
len ratingfour Took me forever to figure out I could drag and drop files some instruction or little semi opaque wording that s says drag and drop files to send here or something would have been great 
len ratingfour Overall though I like that this doesn t become as distracting as slack but still effectively communicates with the team well 
len ratingone This game is stupid I keep getting assignments which have no actual games inside gt 
len ratingone Muy mala aplicaci n no tiene calidad se cae a cada rato
len ratingone bad
len ratingone I ain t tryna do school
len ratingone  Indefinitely spinning loading icons 
len ratingone No support 
len ratingthree Very Tite
len ratingone My school has been using it this year and sometimes it would unmute and ppl won t notice because it wouldn t say are you sure you want to unmute or turn on camera they have to add a are you sure feature
len ratingtwo Mostly gets the job done but with a kind of klunky UI as you might expect from MS Plus it hogs the battery big time 
len ratingtwo It s the heaviest battery user by far of all the apps I use 
len ratingtwo Like times more battery drain than the next heaviest app
len ratingtwo  But I can t use the same phone number for every account so I uninstalled this because you don t even need a phone number for teams it s useless 
len ratingone Por aqu cojo clases as que le doy una estrella c
len ratingthree Recently switched from Slack to Teams free 
len ratingthree Now our guests with their own company Teams MS accounts can t stay connected to monitor activity 
len ratingthree Using web Teams as a workaround but it s causing problems with Windows popping up repair account messages on their PCs 
len ratingthree We have two employees owners one contractor using our email domain and guests who help out with various development tasks 
len ratingthree Since they are helping out as friends they don t want to use their work email addresses 
len ratingthree I see this is a many years old issue so we won t hold our breath for a solution 
len ratingfive I use teams every day it is very good and easy to work with and you can have it on your phone iPad and computer I use it for school ever day now at first it was little confusing but I am sure you will get the hang of it hope this was helpful to you
len ratingone  I m a student who uses this for classes in quarantine Can we please just only give one stars so this app gets taken off the App Store if u do this I sincerely thank you
len ratingone This app used to work pretty decent but now every time i enter class the page says loading a black screen and the rare chance it lets me in it kicks me out immediately 
len ratingone So i had to spend the whole class logging back in constantly to get to my stupid class 
len ratingone also the playback speed is delayed and sometimes audio hurts my ears and gets echoed from time to time 
len ratingone  The only reason why I m forced to use this is because it s a bundle with our agencies enterprise license 
len ratingone It continuously joins me to meetings wile others are presenting in agency wide presentations even though I have it set not to do that and have never unmuted during such meetings 
len ratingone It also on occasion doesn t let me join meetings in progress because the JOIN button is awol 
len ratingone Where did it go 
len ratingone I don t know 
len ratingone I don t have these particular issues on PC but mobile sure does and they have been present for months 
len ratingone Who does QA for Microsoft these days 
len ratingone Not professionals apparently 
len ratingone Hate it
len ratingfive It would be nice if the function to reply to a chat message was also available in the desktop version of Microsoft teams 
len ratingfive I love it so much and all of Microsoft s apps I have been to give it or 
len ratingone Half the time I can t even join a meeting yet I can view the messages 
len ratingone Its the most frustrating thing ever and no matter how many times I close reopen the app it doesn t fix it 
len ratingone Y all should ve kept this update in the drafts 
len ratingfive My company recently went from Skype for business to Teams and Teams is drastically better 
len ratingfive I haven t missed an IM while away from my desk or anything 
len ratingfive It is fast and smooth 
len ratingone Can t even login says I need to connect to internet even though I am 
len ratingfive This app works well 
len ratingfive Thanks for the creation
len ratingfive This app is just as good as the desktop 
len ratingfive I can join meetings with video and audio and chat 
len ratingfive It s extremely easy to use and efficient to have when you re on the go 
len ratingfive It s a must have 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingone Fix the chats
len ratingtwo Microsoft Teams I m pretty sure almost everyone know about it there are good reviews and bad reviews my sister is in nd grade and does more work on teams then a th grader and teams Is good I guess but sometimes it can be really really REALLY 
len ratingtwo Annoying whenever it randomly shuts down so just know download if you have to not really fun 
len ratingone  No
len ratingfive Very clear video easy to use clear instructions for access 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone THIS APP IS BAD IT ALWAYS freezes and didn t let me join my class for days please shut down the app and work on it
len ratingfive First words that came out of my mouth when I thought about how convenient it is to have a portable way to keep work on you 
len ratingfour Okay my first complaint is that when I try to change what my icon looks like it always freezes up and I have to wait forever for it to load to the icon part 
len ratingfour And that s all your going to need to fix 
len ratingfour It s decent 
len ratingone I don t understand why they took down the chat option but i don t like that 
len ratingone Terrible move honestly 
len ratingfour I like it for on the go 
len ratingfour The calendar could be better
len ratingfive Love the Team Chat app 
len ratingfive Teams is my favorite form of staying connected 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Many options and new features coming out regularly 
len ratingfive I am thankful for teams it is an important tool in this new environment 
len ratingfive  RCMSTRONG
len ratingone  I use teams for school and it is the WORST 
len ratingone I get randomly booted and it also freezes on the waiting room screen 
len ratingone There are other issues as well such as it not having audio 
len ratingone But those are the major ones please fix them
len ratingone Please fix mute unmute button issue test case try to join meeting in teams and mute yourself then minimize app and open another apps like outlook safari yahoo WhatsApp apps and try to unmute teams app from this point you are unable to mute unmute only way to unmute is kill your app and rejoin meeting 
len ratingone Issue happening from last months 
len ratingone Hope you guys read and fix this issue 
len ratingone Ios up to date on IPhone XS 
len ratingfive We use it to collaborate in and out of office 
len ratingfive This is a great way to communicate with your team no matter what shift they work on 
len ratingfour There is a bug when you exit the app by pressing the home button or lock the screen while you re in a meeting sometimes it unmutes this can be extremely embarrassing in many occasions 
len ratingfour I really like your app and I hope this issue gets fixed 
len ratingone  Aren t there anyway for having a big larger buttons that these buttons we click times and still didn t click exactly on them 
len ratingtwo  Hi so you might be thinking everyone else gave a star review but I gave only stars so here I go plz read the whole review and you will understand so I use this app for my online classes and sometimes it just cuts the call for no reason and I miss something every time it does that it does that a LOT and sometimes the screen just goes black and I can t see the notes and the worst problem in the assignments when I try to upload more then at a time it takes forever to upload and if I do it by one it is time waste and I doesn t let me upload a video more than seconds which is a bummer for my assignments not the best app
len ratingfive This is one of the best Applications that I have used to collaborate with team members 
len ratingfive From creating meetings sharing files sharing videos and Conference calls it is truly enjoyable experience 
len ratingfive I love teams 
len ratingfive It is the best 
len ratingthree Likes mobile app is nice like the integrated gifs emoticons etc 
len ratingthree  like being able to add a note to my status Not so likes can t forward meeting invites if I add someone to an invite on update it resends the invite to everyone and makes everyone re accept the meeting if I want to create a meeting with the same invite list of a previous meeting there is no easy way to clone or copy the previous invite list to a new meeting when start creating a meeting invite and want to look at a chat or team notice you must discard the meeting invite or send it out incomplete in order to view something else 
len ratingthree  no multiple calendars so I can t see other s calendars without going to Outlook 
len ratingthree  Meeting Notes feature needs work especially for recurring meetings 
len ratingthree For instance I want it to show the latest meeting s notes first but it defaults to the oldest first 
len ratingthree Yes you can move each section up or down 
len ratingthree Not user friendly if more than a few meetings 
len ratingthree In iPad I can t use a meeting in app the voice in in videos on sharing screen not working
len ratingfive Great Quality
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone Why does a messaging app need to be megabytes 
len ratingfive Using this app for team meetings and it has never caused any issues or drop excellent quality with calls and video 
len ratingfive I am using teams in my organization 
len ratingfive It is easy simple efficient collaboration platform emended with office 
len ratingfive Certainly getting a ton accomplished using this app 
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingfour Great app I wish the vid is more good 
len ratingone It would be a perfectly useable and useful app if it weren t for the constant audio off message and fighting it to stay on 
len ratingone No matter what source you choose iPhone speaker AirPods it constantly and randomly switches back to audio off It s been months and months and they haven t fixed this issue 
len ratingone I almost just put my phone through a wall trying to take part in a virtual work meeting 
len ratingone Needs serious work 
len ratingone I just don t like school too stressful would not recommend
len ratingfive Great way to reach people instantly 
len ratingfive I Love it 
len ratingfive Works seamlessly
len ratingfive Teams has been really helpful to coordinate projects and keep track of people schedules and tasks 
len ratingfive Super simple easy to use
len ratingone How do i stop it 
len ratingtwo  This app is so slow and makes my phone blink on and off everytime I join a meeting 
len ratingfive User friendly 
len ratingfive It s great to have work related texts captured and kept separate from my personal texts 
len ratingfive I enjoy connecting with my team using this app
len ratingone  I do not know if this is by design or just a design flaw but every time I have something on Teams and I try to click it and open it it makes me put the password again that kind of defeats the purpose of things but I m driving and trying to take a phone call teams call 
len ratingone And I m saying one star because this is a communication tool and I am tired of logging in every time I need to communicate via the Phone app well not really every time but at least of the time 
len ratingtwo There was an update that changed every single symbol in te app and I want it back to normal pls
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingtwo This app is honestly bad 
len ratingtwo Most of the time it works pretty okay 
len ratingtwo But sometimes like today it has issues uploading files and submitting assignments 
len ratingtwo I ve had to log in and out and now I had to delete and redownload to attempt to fix this problem 
len ratingone So I use this app for school and at first the app worked perfectly fine but now that it has been a while it tends to freeze the audio goes in and out and sometimes I can t see my teachers meetings which is really important because I need to go to school please fix it 
len ratingthree I like the app but it s a royal pain to re login every day 
len ratingone Delete this app I hate it it s the worst thing ever 
len ratingone I never get onto my meeting on time and it doesn t let me get into buildings
len ratingfive I love the fact that it is constantly upgrading and combing up with making users experiences better 
len ratingone too laggy on laptop and the teachers dont know what they re doing hope they find somethint else better to do
len ratingone The sending speed is way too slow 
len ratingone When I was doing an assignment I keep seeing the loading amp loading 
len ratingone It is too slow 
len ratingone Can you make it much more faster 
len ratingthree Says there is new notifications but there really isn t anything new 
len ratingfive Teams app does not allow me to schedule a meeting and attached the link 
len ratingfive It only sets the meeting up with no video conference capabilities 
len ratingfive I have to do this phone from my computer
len ratingone It s so slow I miss classes every time
len ratingone Just installed update and the app crashes when you try to open it 
len ratingone The app is so laggy to the point that I can t even get on the meeting of the time 
len ratingone I also get kicked off the meeting the rare chance I get in 
len ratingone I also can t leave the meeting the rare chance that I stay on until the end 
len ratingone Honestly ZOOM is somehow betting than this app 
len ratingone It s honestly terrible it never works for me the sound is always glitching out and I get kicked out of the meeting all the time
len ratingone This app is terrible i cant open the app without getting kicked out and when i do it s SO slow 
len ratingone  would NOT recommend
len ratingone No quiero cojer clasessss 
len ratingone I d like to share some slides on PC and make discussion with hand writing using my iPad app with an Apple Pencil in meetings but I found Teams is totally useless for my purpose 
len ratingone First desktop app cannot share the iPad screen connected to the PC 
len ratingone So the iPad itself must be connected to internet even you are sitting in front of a networked PC and you need to log in again 
len ratingone Second you cannot share the whiteboard with guest users outside your organization 
len ratingone This feature has not implemented for a long time 
len ratingone Third screen sharing has not work after mid October 
len ratingone I guess it is caused by the problem with iPadOS and I found the same issue reports in the Microsoft support site but this critical problem has not solved 
len ratingone I suggest Zoom and WebEx are much smart if you plan to share the hand writing screen 
len ratingone No me gusto el juego esta muy chafa el nivel no lo puedes pasar
len ratingone  It is very bad that the students can not drawing or share screen with class 
len ratingone Zoom is better than Microsoft teams 
len ratingthree Pioneer Rayz has a conference speaker sold by Apple accessory store that does not work with this app please add this feature 
len ratingthree Also make it easier to log in and automatically see your team instead of having to pull the refresh to see them after log in 
len ratingfive It s a great app to keep in touch with my team 
len ratingfive I love how easy it is to use 
len ratingone Calls come through even when your phone is on do not disturb 
len ratingone There is also no way to turn off calls but still get a push notification when someone has called you 
len ratingfour Would be nice to be able to delete chats instead of just hiding them
len ratingfive No se que me har a sin ella las dem s qu hay para llamadas virtuales y conferencias en grupo no funcionan tambi n c mo est Gracias por el apoyo A 
len ratingfour Works Amazing
len ratingone I hate to say this because when I speak to someone there they are nice but when I can t get them to let me in on my video visit to see my mother it makes me wonder if she is ok or not and they don t want me to know this has happened the last two visits not happy about certain things going on there
len ratingone Did not like it because i have to open it Monday Thursday it takes up space and I wish I could delete it 
len ratingfour In terms of the app works great to make sure I get notified of Team communication 
len ratingfour In terms of the overall product I selected Teams for my company because it had better out of the box features than its primary competitor and integrates nicely with Microsoft license management 
len ratingfour So onboarding becomes fairly hassle free 
len ratingfour Compared with pure chat tools a team focused tool like this is nice since it keeps it to just your team i e 
len ratingfour no spam 
len ratingfour However while we use Teams for ad hoc calls and chat which is what it s good at we are continuing to use Zoom for all company meetings since COVID 
len ratingfour Teams still has a way to go to match Zoom in that regard 
len ratingone Pls don t download this app
len ratingtwo  I ve have two doctors appointments and the scene is black I had to log out then back on just to get the mic working kinda feel like I m back having phone calls please fix I have another appointment Tuesday Happy Thanksgiving and take care and stay safe fix that I ll rate ya a star no doubt thanks
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I deal with multiple entities and countries around the world for my communications and Teams has offered a very simplistic way of transferring mass media files and easy communications around the globe 
len ratingfive I highly recommend all corporations and small business adopt Teams into their daily functions as it will ease operations immensely 
len ratingfour I am used to and like the fact that Skype sings to notify that someone joined the meeting 
len ratingfour Teams does not do that 
len ratingfour It s great but I try to share my screen and it ll send me a notification like return back to application disappointed
len ratingfour Hello
len ratingfive Keeps me in contact and pretty easy for our company to use 
len ratingfive Works good 
len ratingfive Easy to join and host meetings 
len ratingfive Really enjoy the mute button 
len ratingfive It allows you the opportunity to cut out all distractions 
len ratingthree zoom on mobile doesn t do this 
len ratingone bad
len ratingfive Teams is so much better than zoom teams doesn t make teams doesn t kick you out for no reason Teams doesn t steal your information teams actually has a security software and you can hear the audio so much better I don t know how that s possible because you have the same microphone your teams and do this but I don t know maybe cause zoom lags so much so get teams
len ratingone The meeting icon is missing from the free version of the all and MS support is absolutely horrible 
len ratingthree Writing this review to complain about no possibility to do full screen as was possible in previous version 
len ratingthree Not understanding why i need to see useless controls on screen all the time 
len ratingone I hate this app 
len ratingthree Teams is generally slow and finicky 
len ratingthree I really like the mobile feature that allows messengers to quote a previous comment 
len ratingthree That s a feature absent on the desktop version 
len ratingthree A real bummer 
len ratingfive Amazing to all team members in the loop
len ratingone Estoy cansada de tanta clase
len ratingfour This has proven a greater solution for webinars and virtual meetings to take over the place of live meetings we d counted on 
len ratingfour Only frustration live edits being made to a shared document occasionally freeze up that software 
len ratingone This is getting worst day by day 
len ratingone Very slow in responce 
len ratingone Changing of status not working some times 
len ratingone And i try to use dark theme from weeks i changed settings and closed and open the app so many time still no use it always in light theme 
len ratingone Then what is the use of giving option to change the Appearance 
len ratingfive This tool integrates with all enterprise tools in the Microsoft suite highly recommended 
len ratingfive Great for sharing files and conversations with teammates
len ratingfive At first I was hesitant about Teams 
len ratingfive It works perfectly fine on both Android and IOS devices 
len ratingfive Good app for making me do work when I m not at work 
len ratingfive I honestly think eveeyone should use teams 
len ratingfive It is great at doing everything a team needs to be able to work seamlessly at a distance 
len ratingthree I just wonder when can the automatically light dark theme change can be available have been waiting lifelong but with various updates it keeps the same I still have to switch it manually which kind of annoys me when I open the app at night
len ratingone Meetings never pop up for everyone 
len ratingone I missed all my classes due to this problem 
len ratingone Just put a one star so it can be deleted
len ratingtwo The problem is that you can build up a meeting quickly by only meeting now on a laptop and not on any other devices Ex 
len ratingtwo iPads Tablet amp iPhone
len ratingone the application just won t work it always crash and when it doesn t it just laggs and doesn t let me in the meeting
len ratingone It won t let me join anything it s really bad I wish I could get this no stars please update
len ratingone Very ghetto Unprofessional Yall give assignments and I feel like y all should one star and not stars 
len ratingthree My children used this and it s actually for online school but she said she has technically defuclties think u need update
len ratingfive You guys should add backgrounds for iOS
len ratingone  App is broke on iOS even after reinstall 
len ratingone Search button hangs app 
len ratingone Calls button hangs app 
len ratingone Frequently app shows blank screen 
len ratingone Remember Notification Preferences Teams should remember notification preferences between sign out and sign in 
len ratingfour The iPhone app is a great alternative to the app running on my PC 
len ratingfour I have slow internet in my home so I can use the phone app to attend meetings instead 
len ratingfour I wish it were easier to use my phone for audio at the same time as using my PC for video 
len ratingone i just don t like school lol
len ratingthree this is a cool App i do my school on it
len ratingfour I use this for school and it s very useful and is just less crappy then Zoom and Google Classroom and is responsive 
len ratingfour HOWEVER it can be glitchy at times and I ve been booted outta meetings sometimes and inconveniences are annoying 
len ratingfour But overall good app 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingtwo There is a lot of lag and it s almost impossible to learn things 
len ratingone  These app has a slow problem in having the upload page show up when I click upload work 
len ratingone It just took a long time so I gave up 
len ratingone Microsoft is really dum 
len ratingfive Teams has made communication easy for me and for my team 
len ratingfive I am grateful for it 
len ratingone Give me admin in teams or else I will make ur app suffer
len ratingfive TEAMS makes collaboration made easy and best of all transforming lives all over the world 
len ratingfive Great for reminders and easy system to join meetings 
len ratingone Lots of people have been working online so there are lots of programs competing for users 
len ratingone I m disappointed that my school is using Teams instead of Zoom because it is not as nice for teachers to share screens with their students 
len ratingone I wish the program had some of those better functions like allowing the teacher to see more than one student in share screen mode or by allowing on screen annotation 
len ratingone Breakout rooms are also another function that is missing 
len ratingone Yes I know if I don t like it I should just switch but it s not up to me it s up to my school 
len ratingone Adding these functions would allow me to improve my rating 
len ratingfive In these times it has been a life saver that has even improved in short circles 
len ratingone  Iam a teacher and sometimes I need to show the students a video without needing the laptop 
len ratingthree I dont want my teachers finding out on what i right can you make a button that allows to delete conversations pls overall the app is great though
len ratingfive It is an excellent option to chat with my colleagues share screens etc 
len ratingfive In my opinion the best option to organize meetings 
len ratingfive The quality of the audio and video are excellent either from my computer or from my iPhone 
len ratingfive Congratulations 
len ratingtwo A few weeks ago The app just signed me out and I ont let me sign back in 
len ratingtwo I can get on PC but IPhone no longer allows it
len ratingfour Connection freezes at least a couple times in each session
len ratingfive You can actually send pictures and gifs with this chat
len ratingfour It would be great if you could add a feature that allows you to mark up photos posted in teams chat to allow visual feedback 
len ratingfour Wechat has this and its extremely helpful 
len ratingfive The app is a great tool to have when you have your step away from the computer 
len ratingfive You have full functionality in terms of chat calls and meetings 
len ratingfive Of course an docs that are saved on private drives are not accessible but the basics are 
len ratingfive Teams it is okay but I idkkk it just does stuff that annoying but I love sooooo yea peace out
len ratingone Uhh what the heck happened to pdf sharing 
len ratingone I can no longer work the way i used to 
len ratingone This is a paid service that had that removed 
len ratingone Unacceptable if that s the case our how engineering office might move off the platform 
len ratingone This needs a but fix ASAP 
len ratingfive Learning more about the functions etc would be great 
len ratingfive Overall satisfied
len ratingfour Copy paste text into chat message needs improvement 
len ratingfour We used Skype before and it was easy to format 
len ratingfive Purple is nice
len ratingone I missed a work meeting because this app did not work 
len ratingone I tried so many times 
len ratingone Such a waste of time 
len ratingone It is not user friendly 
len ratingone I don t not have the meeting option from the app 
len ratingone Bad very bad 
len ratingone I could not join my work meeting very frustrating 
len ratingone It gave me this error This meeting is not accepting guests I was not even a guest 
len ratingone I was invited 
len ratingone Clicked on link from calendar reminder to join and it did not work 
len ratingone Created an account and tried to join and the same thing 
len ratingone Very bad experience 
len ratingone Ruined my day 
len ratingfive Great app definitely a great way to work and bring people together 
len ratingfive Sound can be terrible at times though 
len ratingfive Other than that no complaints
len ratingone I can t call people on the app nor on a computer
len ratingfive It works and does what it s suppose to
len ratingone I got hacked
len ratingfive This app is useful for collaboration with team during work from home 
len ratingfive Also I like the device transfer functionality which allows you to connect from multiple device and also switch devices seamlessly 
len ratingone Microsoft Teams is the worst computer software platform I used because it keeps crashing all the time my camera stops working all the time and everything stops working all the time 
len ratingone I don t have to keep restarting my computer every time it keeps crashing 
len ratingone Please fix it NOW 
len ratingone Will not work for me 
len ratingone Can you help 
len ratingone  This may seem like a good app but when you try to enter a meeting you have to close the app reopen it and go into the app just to join it 
len ratingone It doesn t change your profile picture to others it keeps unmuting me at random points and the cherry on top is that it crashed just about all the time
len ratingthree Teams is an amazing app I can use to connect with many of my online friends my school and more 
len ratingthree This is a great way to communicate with people 
len ratingthree I ve been quarantined in my house for the last few days and this helps me do school 
len ratingthree The one thing is that it is very SPOTTY depending on the wifi connections you have but the app is an OUTSTANDING MASTERPIECE 
len ratingone Whenever I use Ms teams on my phone it blinks back in forth to a black screen 
len ratingone Very inconvenient considering that I am utilizing this app for school 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingthree I just got to the meeting and it kicked me out of the meeting
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfour Mobile Teams app is amazingly easy to use and super convenient 
len ratingfour Only issue is when I join video folks say they can only see parts of my face and I know it s not my phone camera 
len ratingthree Great reliable app 
len ratingthree Would be star if it gave a view of Outlook emails 
len ratingone dear team any online video not working or download at all kindly solve this
len ratingthree Really good app for communication but this glitch is freaking me out i cant turn off my camera no matter what but the weird thing is that it put the off icon of the camera even tho its on
len ratingfive This service is excellent so much better than SKYPE Thank you Sodexo 
len ratingfive I use this platform for school it is awesome 
len ratingfour I like many others use my ipad for school teams is what we use on campus and for remote learning it would be amazing if the teams app on IOS mobile would behave the same way as on a computer 
len ratingfour Features such as having the video call minimized while you switch apps etc 
len ratingfive I really like how eveyis in one place that we need 
len ratingfive Easy to find and access 
len ratingfour Easy to use and administer 
len ratingfour Need to be able to add breakout rooms more easily and with changeable dynamic assignments 
len ratingfour Need to be able to whiteboard more intuitively 
len ratingone This is not a good app for kid we need to make a better app plz give this a read
len ratingfour Teams works well if everyone has the app downloaded to their computers 
len ratingfour It s not as easy as Zoom for folks who aren t familiar with it 
len ratingfour But once someone has the app it s pretty seamless 
len ratingfour Breakout groups work well except people who call in get left behind 
len ratingtwo Writing this on the app store seeing as you can t review on the microsoft website 
len ratingtwo On pc the away status is triggered without activity 
len ratingtwo Even if you are on your computer watching a training or in a video meeting the status will go to the away mode after a couple of minutes of not moving your mouse 
len ratingtwo Considering the number of people who are working remotely who rely on their status being accurate this feature really needs to be fixed so that if you are watching a video the status does not automatically change 
len ratingone Mic unmutes along with the camera and it a huge lack of privacy now I m known as the kid who called someone old 
len ratingfive From chatting to video calls to document sharing and scheduling 
len ratingfive Teams is the one stop for most logistical needs 
len ratingone I keep getting a sign in error message stating that I need to connect to the internet when I try to login from my iPhone 
len ratingone I m certain that I m connected to the internet I checked my phone rebooted it and all my other web based features are functional 
len ratingone I tried it on three different phones and it s still not working 
len ratingone It has worked for months before this I m certain it was working last week 
len ratingone What could be the issue 
len ratingone How can it be resolved 
len ratingfour Please fix this 
len ratingfour When my teacher gives me the link to go to Microsoft meetings it does not let me 
len ratingfour I just begs me to put in my Microsoft password and more 
len ratingfour I only wanna come in as a guest 
len ratingfour I mean teams is a pretty much nice application 
len ratingfour Just some problems blocking the way 
len ratingfour First screen share 
len ratingfour I use teams on iPad and when the teacher shares the screen I couldn t see the shared screen ever since your last update 
len ratingfour Secondly full gallery 
len ratingfour What s with the delay with it showing all the cameras 
len ratingfour Though besides those problems I think it s a nice application 
len ratingone Worked fine on both iPads until a few weeks ago 
len ratingone Then it would keep freezing on the iPad Air after a few seconds before we could even join any class meetings 
len ratingone Just cannot get it to work reliably 
len ratingone Though it continues to work well on my other child s iPad 
len ratingone What gives 
len ratingthree It s highly functional but lacks the life of Slack 
len ratingthree Wish you could add custom emojis to comments 
len ratingthree Guess it s fine for business but lacks the humanity of other chat products 
len ratingfour I say as long as the app is running you should show as available 
len ratingfour Messages and calls come through and you could be toggling through emails or downloading a document 
len ratingfour It stinks that it sets your status as away the second the app is in the background
len ratingfive I have been using Teams with my Apple Lighting to HDMI adapter and the video works great but I can t get the audio to work on the TV 
len ratingfive I checked and other apps do work for audio and video 
len ratingfive Love to be able to make the meeting and stay up to date with what is happening at work
len ratingtwo The concept of collaboration hub is good but the execution is very poor app is slow and the videoconference service isn t reliable Microsoft Teams is not a serious professional service 
len ratingfive I m a student who uses Teams every day for learning 
len ratingfive I really like it but sometimes it doesn t respond and closes 
len ratingfive Other than that it is great 
len ratingfive It keeps me organized with each of my classes having different teams and allowing each of my teachers to assign different things and have them all listed on one platform 
len ratingfive I have ideas on how to improve the platform 
len ratingfive The first one is to make it so we the students can filter assignments by the due date and so that we can pin certain posts and people and go to our pinned section to find them faster 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams is great 
len ratingfive Thank you Teams everything is more organized now 
len ratingthree On my iPhone and every time I attempt to take a picture or attach a picture the app freezes and I have to close by swiping up so it will reopen 
len ratingthree It s been this way for at least a few weeks and it s difficult to use without that 
len ratingthree I use the windows version of the time which is great 
len ratingthree I m amazed something as important as that made it past QA 
len ratingthree My one complaint with all of Microsoft is that it logs me out of my accounts one note teams forms planner etc 
len ratingthree every minutes 
len ratingthree I share an account with someone bc Microsoft can t merge two company s together and it logs me out 
len ratingthree So I have to ask the person every day to sign me back in 
len ratingthree I think they re starting to hate me because of it 
len ratingthree So thank you Microsoft for making my coworker resent me making my work life harder making me realize google is better 
len ratingfive So I needed to download this app for school and it works well
len ratingfive The app works pretty well on the computer but one issue I have is that when your running a VM on your PC the pop up window with a message just stays on the screen and you cannot close it 
len ratingone This app is sooooooooooooooooooo bad and its really buggy not even a computer from the nasa can take this REEEEEEEEEE
len ratingone When I open teams on my laptop it s great until about minutes in and it freezes everything on my computer 
len ratingone I have to literally shut down my entire computer to start the app again 
len ratingone So then I ll open the app on my phone and now I can t use the camera so no one can see me and I can t see them 
len ratingone Yes I ve given the app access to my camera 
len ratingone It s incredibly frustrating
len ratingone This app has issues literally every single week 
len ratingone  Teams has more problems than I would prefer 
len ratingone Multiple classmates of mine have lost their saved work because teams deleted it randomly not to mention it s also hard to navigate 
len ratingfive Fantastic app
len ratingone Everything is good but the QUALITY is rlly bad 
len ratingone  they should fix that I feel uncomfortable being with no good qualities it s just bad for me but it s okay keep up and thank you very much for reading this and please send a feed back
len ratingone Por qu yolo
len ratingone I hate school
len ratingone  It s very good at glitching in class
len ratingone You complete assignments and hand them in your teacher grades them then that s it yay 
len ratingone But then you get it back your teacher asks for corrections on your work and you do them and you feel good about them then you submit it 
len ratingone You re happy because it was a big grade then the end of the marking period comes and you look at your grade and it hasn t changed and you ask your teacher and they say I m sorry but I didn t get a notification you handed it in then you look at all your other grades and they re all bad not terrible but you want avg so you do corrections on s so I m sitting here getting terrible grades on assignments handing them back I to keep the same grade plz fix your app and notify teachers when someone hands in an assignment or corrections plz j fix it it s really annoying
len ratingfive Teams is better than Skype and easy to use in mobile and desktop 
len ratingfive Works fine in Apple Watch also 
len ratingfive I would like more features in Apple Watch for this app 
len ratingthree Just want my dropbox back 
len ratingfive The answer to all teleworking needs 
len ratingfive It s very convenient meeting app it just synchronized with calendar that we won t miss any meeting events 
len ratingfive I personally recommend this app 
len ratingfive So I have school her in Microsoft teams and it helps a lot no ads no hackers no bad things but i all was get out for Results i don t now I get in exsam and also it says that no metings so ya but helpful
len ratingtwo I was unable to log into my company teams for a week because there is a glitch on the login page 
len ratingtwo Whenever I type in my work email it will just give me an error repeatedly and say error contact administrator 
len ratingtwo The only work around was typing in another company email then once it brought up my company page signing in with my proper email and password 
len ratingtwo It was ridiculous glitch that if I didn t find out I would not have been able to log in 
len ratingtwo My IT department was not able to figure it out either and suggested to wipe my phone 
len ratingfive Overall the app is great However the app should automatically take you to your last read so you don t have to scroll up 
len ratingfive Also there should be an option to forward text someone more than one image at a time 
len ratingfive Our program switched over from Google to Microsoft 
len ratingfive I quote like how we can text and call people 
len ratingfive Awesome app works perfectly for me and my coworkers the only thing when having meetings they should add mute button
len ratingthree I was in English class watching my phone and my mic was muted but everyone could hear me 
len ratingthree I got in trouble 
len ratingthree Good app but you sold
len ratingfive I love that you can have multiple accounts 
len ratingfive Please add that feature to the desktop app 
len ratingthree Works fairly well but for a long time the status indicators in chat do not update to other users current status 
len ratingthree Have to select a person to go to that chat where the actual status is correct 
len ratingthree Go back to main list still wrong go back to user go back to main list then finally correct 
len ratingthree Main list refreshes do not help 
len ratingthree Seems a simple bug to fix but for a year now does not work 
len ratingthree I would like to be able to open multiple screens at once in teams to be able to view them at the same time 
len ratingthree I think that would bring more value 
len ratingfive The Microsoft teams app is a simple to use function that makes communication amongst co workers and organizations so much easier 
len ratingfive The functionalities are simple and the ability to transfer files can be done with ease 
len ratingfive Microsoft continues to innovate and leave great impressions 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingtwo I have been having problems joining teams meetings from my phone 
len ratingtwo I can do it from my laptop but it s much more complicated from my phone 
len ratingtwo When I log in and hit join there is a drop down that lists either or options 
len ratingtwo Problem is that there is no consistency and when I only get options I cannot select call me since it s not listed 
len ratingtwo Problem appears when I can see all options 
len ratingtwo One is call me so I hit that 
len ratingtwo But then I need to select my number to call and I then get a call so I answer the call and it tells me to press if I want to join the call 
len ratingtwo Then I have to find the dial pad and press 
len ratingtwo Biggest problem is that the dial pad doesn t recognize me pressing so I am unable to join the call 
len ratingtwo It simply asks me again to press even though I have already done that 
len ratingtwo  Problem is that this is way too many steps to join a call by the way 
len ratingtwo Thanks
len ratingfour Estos aud fonos funcionan muy bien con el iPhone y temas pero en las PC duran minutos y se pierde la comunicaci n 
len ratingfour Es una situaci n que solo se da con Teams 
len ratingfour Con zoom y google meet y otras aplicaciones no hay ese problema
len ratingone  no lo recomiendo
len ratingfour Overall calls are easy I would suggest making the button you hit to pick up your call green 
len ratingfour Keep the hang up button red 
len ratingfour That would be helpful 
len ratingone It s not form fitted to the iPhone X notch style screen 
len ratingone It s still that iPhone style resolution
len ratingfive Time saver Team organizer great app
len ratingfour I started using teams earlier this year with no problems we all in a pandemic and i am a student 
len ratingfour Lately we have been having problems with the class as in other people can join in the call which they shouldn t because you do not need a code to join classes 
len ratingfour So what i am wondering is can you fix the hacking that is going in all my classes 
len ratingfive We recently switched from Cisco Webex to teams 
len ratingfive Best decision we ve ever made 
len ratingfive Our productivity has went up so much 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingone Teams makes everything slower 
len ratingfive I ve use slack for years and we moved over to office and took advantage of Microsoft teams 
len ratingfive It is an absolutely amazing product and does incredible things 
len ratingfive I would never look back at going to slack 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfive Una de las mejores aplicaciones que e visto
len ratingone This is the worst app I have EVER BEEN IN 
len ratingone Always says I m back and kicks you out 
len ratingone EVERY MINUTE 
len ratingone EVEN IN TABS 
len ratingone This deserves stars 
len ratingfive Flames
len ratingtwo Turns off when im in calls lags too much 
len ratingfive Its amazing for remote school because you get reminders for class and get reminders for homework
len ratingone  Now I can t even text to my friends 
len ratingone This is outrageous 
len ratingone You d just cancel my account if I text to my friends 
len ratingone Bill Gates the next Hitler 
len ratingone Why don t you just update the app icon and add Hitler s greeting in the big person 
len ratingone I bet everyone would agree with that 
len ratingone I would have given you half star but you knew that everybody would rate half star so you eliminated the options of giving you half star 
len ratingone Sincerely yours Adrian Baez P S 
len ratingone Please read my other reviews 
len ratingthree Toggling through the interface isn t smooth 
len ratingthree The difference between a Team a chat and a channel gets blurred 
len ratingthree In general MS web based products require to much drilling down into settings fields and etc 
len ratingthree There s too many clicks required to get to what I need and too many spaces for team communication 
len ratingthree This digital era is defined by swiping tool integration and overall ease of use 
len ratingthree I love all the integration with Outlook amp SharePoint 
len ratingthree The downside is that I feel like MS products are similar to android phone interfaces and Google is similar to iPhone interfaces 
len ratingthree People want to collab quickly easily and without much user customization 
len ratingthree MS products is not the space for that 
len ratingfive This app is great for me when I m doing work or calls for school online
len ratingfive Great Team collaboration and document control tool for both Fortune and small business alike 
len ratingfour The app is awesome but it s awful to have at work 
len ratingfour I ll get notifications on my desktop and also my phone 
len ratingfour Definitely not a full stop issue but something I d love to see addressed 
len ratingfive Awesome and effective way to communicate with the team 
len ratingfour I love this app I think it s great for school or work which is what I use it for 
len ratingfour It s just that sometimes when I try to join a meeting the join button just isn t there 
len ratingfour That s a big issue because to fix this I have to delete the app and redownload it 
len ratingfour Please fix that thanks
len ratingfive Team work makes the Dream Work 
len ratingthree When using it for conferencing and access to files it works great however screen sharing is a painful and slow process that sometimes cause the app to crash 
len ratingthree It makes collaboration painful and tedious 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingthree Used on an iPad Pro rd generation 
len ratingfive I LOVE this app 
len ratingfive It is great because I use my mobile device for meetings and I can use my computer for work so I like that it can be on mobile Apple devices but the only flaw is IT SHOWS THAT I HAVE NOTIFICATIONS WHEN THERES NOT SUPPOSED TO BE 
len ratingfive Which drives me crazy 
len ratingfive Everything inside the app is fine but I recommend changing the you have to make people presenters when they enter the meeting to let people be presenters all the time 
len ratingfive The only thing annoying is the notification thing 
len ratingfive And when I am on my Lock Screen there are no notifications but when I am in my home screen then there is a number in the corner of the app logo 
len ratingfive Thank you for reading this response have a great day night 
len ratingfour Search for stuff on general chats is a pain 
len ratingfour You need to scroll up and down until you find what you neex 
len ratingone I hate this app
len ratingfive I like the app
len ratingfive Teams doing a lot for the business activities
len ratingone Es racista hay personas que nos ponen a trabajar
len ratingone Super slow keeps freezing remote control on the desktop version is not practical because does not show the prompts 
len ratingone Too heavy to load 
len ratingone Calendar is also designed poorly 
len ratingone You have to send invitations to all when you fix a minor spelling 
len ratingone Terrible design
len ratingone Ok so first I found this app cause I need it for school but when I download it it says connection error every time it also happens with all my friends so yeah it just doesn t work
len ratingfive Teams is excellent all around and has given me problems 
len ratingfive Easy to use and the quality of calls txts functionality is superb 
len ratingfive Must have 
len ratingone I press the back button then it deleted the paragraph I worked on for hours for 
len ratingone Teams works fine on a Windows machine but I have yet to have it work on my iPad or iPhone correctly 
len ratingone Just wasted minutes where some people couldn t get in some people couldn t see the screen 
len ratingone We ended up moving to ZOOM 
len ratingone I won t waste my time using this again 
len ratingone No sirve para nada tiene errores se traba mucho los gr ficos son malos nunca cargan las pantallas El traductor es muy malo se escucha borroso no sirve
len ratingfive Our company started incorporating more advanced Microsoft products at the end of including Teams 
len ratingfive What a time saver 
len ratingfive No more jumping on planes and living around the notion that every meeting has to be done in person 
len ratingfive From a global company stand point the first half of more effective meeting and forward progress on collaboration was done than any other year 
len ratingfive Many things are integrated into Teams to make it as seamless as possible 
len ratingfive Some of these include video meeting screen sharing multi screen control calendar management sync of calendar multi device sync controlled notifications text message integration user group creation profile management in meeting management like mute for those who don t know when to mute microphone 
len ratingfive In all very well thought out app 
len ratingfive If you can t do some of these things it s the administrative person that hasn t given user rights 
len ratingfive Watch out Apple because Microsoft has created one meeting management App for the modern work place so people can work remotely in this COVID era and any other future eras 
len ratingone One reason I have to go to school 
len ratingone Every morning I have to wake up and go to this dumb website 
len ratingone I hate the fact that this was created in the first place 
len ratingone I also understand that this is for educational and business but just think on how is student have to wake up go to school and do this over and over again ove the course of one year
len ratingone this app so annoying it keeps signing me out of my account and whenever im in a meeting call my phone blacks out
len ratingfour Sharing screen doesnt work efficiently 
len ratingone I hate because you can t share content which I think everyone should be able to share content
len ratingone Ok so I do school on this and it s horrible 
len ratingone It s so laggy and glitchy I don t like it at all 
len ratingone When we do screen share we are automatically getting audio it s quite annoying so if we are in meetings and want to share with person outside meeting it is throwing out of first meeting
len ratingone Terrible sign in services
len ratingone Nama le doy una estrella porque ya me tienen hasta la puta las clases jajajaja Wandita polque me hicite esto 
len ratingfive I enjoy this means of communication in a world where technology is key 
len ratingfour I really enjoy using teams 
len ratingfour I m a student and it s really nice and simple to use however every so often my phones screen will turn off depending on the angle of my phone 
len ratingfour And it is very annoying when I m trying to see the screen but it keeps turning off 
len ratingfour Other than that it s quite good 
len ratingfour Alright so I use teams for school and stuff but I have a problem with it It keeps kicking me out of the app and there would be times where my mic won t open and sometimes I get kicked out by someone and for no reason so when I come back in I have no idea if my camera s in or not even but instead I always have to ask the people I m in a call with to tell me wether my camera s in or not since I can t see if it is or not So may you please fix you app a little 
len ratingfive please add the option to download attendance list the same way it works on the desktop version 
len ratingfive this a very important function thanks
len ratingthree Since august I ve been using teams for quite a while cause I have school 
len ratingthree But when it doesn t work I get mad because I m gonna be marked tardy for not showing up to a meeting on time 
len ratingthree The problem is that the loading bar doesn t stop and when I tap to switch to a different chat or the calendar or the teams it freezes 
len ratingthree And it freezes for a long time 
len ratingthree I ve tried to clear app data I ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling it but nothing seems to work 
len ratingthree I ve looked up many ways on how to fix it but it just doesn t cooperate 
len ratingthree I believe that I m the only person having this problem since everyone else seems fine 
len ratingthree But can I get some more suggestions on how to fix this 
len ratingthree Overall when I did use the app before it was great 
len ratingthree There were some minor problems but those were fixed shortly after 
len ratingthree Please tell me how to fix this I can t stand having to go to the website just to use teams 
len ratingfive It s a big help for us to communicate with for colleagues especially in peak hours u can back read what u forgot 
len ratingfive  Teams brings so many great aspects of collaboration together in a great Microsoft tool 
len ratingfive Love the mobile app 
len ratingfive Huge fan 
len ratingtwo My biggest pet peeve with apps is inconsistently and that s the issue I have with Teams sometimes I get alerts sometimes I don t sometimes I get them on my Apple Watch sometimes I don t and there doesn t therefore I trust it 
len ratingthree The app works great the chat functionality works well as does the sharing 
len ratingthree I don t like the meetings as compared to WebEx 
len ratingthree I am forced to start the meeting on both my phone and my computer so I can walk around and see it on a larger screen 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams is a great app 
len ratingfive Easy to use multiple benefits
len ratingtwo  Teams should remember notification preferences between sign out and sign in 
len ratingone  THIS APP IS THE REASON I GAVE UP ON LIFE PLEASE DELETE IT 
len ratingone AND I HATE IT SO MUCH BEVAUSE THIS APP MENTALLY DRAINS MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND STOP PUTTING THE LATE OPTION ON I LITERALLY DONT HAVE TIME TO CATCH UP ON ANY ASSIGNMENTS
len ratingfive I love MS TEAMS 
len ratingone My Account on teams is glitching and it doesn t let me see anything now for no reason FIX IT 
len ratingone THE dam THING keeps FREAZing and I HAVE TO KEET RE JOINING THE DAM CALL
len ratingthree Love teams but the functionality between phone tablet and desktop varies way too much 
len ratingthree Some functions on one device same function not available on another device etc 
len ratingthree Needs to be brought more in line across all devices 
len ratingone Me esclavisaron con esta app 
len ratingfour Seems it tailors pretty well to different user needs 
len ratingfour Once protocols are set though the integration of different functions storage transfer upload download via Chat Files to and from One Drive and open for edit and save e g 
len ratingfour  can vary from shop to shop AND team to team but with little tool support for practice and protocol notes or docs 
len ratingfour Accessing the robust toolset of Excel e g for edit and update requires a strict set of steps not spec ed anywhere obvious 
len ratingfour As someone who is more of a file and tech worker than a simple cc list Chat and Read This worker it s still taking a little longer than expected 
len ratingfour But we re getting there 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo It doesn t work on iPhone 
len ratingtwo It takes forever to load and sign in and then it closes constantly 
len ratingtwo I don t know what the problem is but it s not something I expect from Microsoft 
len ratingfour Awesome collaboration tool but I wish it wouldn t log me out automatically so often 
len ratingfour It s not clear why it logs me out and I m not aware of it until I try to get into the app 
len ratingfour Makes it so I m not getting messages when they re sent 
len ratingfive It s great and a faster way to send messages to coworkers 
len ratingfour It was very good not laggy at all but i do not get how you put virtual backgrounds
len ratingfive Especially when we are working remotely this app really connects the team well 
len ratingfive We can always talk to the team or have group meetings or presentations everything on the click of a button 
len ratingone About once a day it requires me to enter a code it texts me to log in 
len ratingone I ve emailed Microsoft but of course no reply from them 
len ratingone It s ok and all but Microsoft has WAY to many bugs 
len ratingone Like Microsoft s Roblox is completely messed up 
len ratingone And same goes for teams 
len ratingone I just can t seem to start a meeting so 
len ratingone I can schedule a meeting but I can t start a meeting 
len ratingone What is this 
len ratingfive Micro stuff is like the best thing ever if you want to meet with someone like I am a student and I literally can be on teams I can be like like like calling my teacher all day it s the best thing if you want to call someone and post on the chat it s it s the best because you can put like background and all of that it s the best thing ever you should download it because it actually works if you like in work like if you re a student and you need to like do it from home if your virtual like it s the best thing if you did do schoolwork or anything that you need to do it with even my sister uses the best thing ever you should download it 
len ratingtwo It works fine on my computer at work 
len ratingtwo But I have to have this work on my phone and I ve done everything it says in troubleshooting repeatedly and had our IT team try to fig out why I don t get notifications on my phone unless I started the message or am tagged 
len ratingtwo Completely useless when you have team members reaching out for anyone to assist 
len ratingone Hi I always find my self with an open mic or cam while not meaning to and that s because of bugs this should be fixed since it is disturbing privacy
len ratingone Works well when it works not as user friendly as they would like you to believe 
len ratingone It is always laggy and never lets me unmute
len ratingone If you navigate out of the app when you are on a conference call and return controls like mute won t work
len ratingfive Intuitive interface that allows me to stay connected with my team on the go 
len ratingone  everyone that hates school knows what I m talking about so if you hate school rate this app one star 
len ratingone Does the basics but miss the important team ability to have thread conversations 
len ratingone It needs to rise above social text messaging functionality to work for business use 
len ratingfive I am often on the go 
len ratingfive Using the TEAMS app on my iPhone is a lifesaver 
len ratingthree After upgrading to iOS I can no longer mute unmute calls from the Lock Screen requiring me to unlock and navigate to the Teams app to mute unmute which is very cumbersome and frustrating 
len ratingone The meeting are bad
len ratingfour The app is great but if you try to us it on your phone or tablet it s starts to flicker on and off
len ratingtwo This app is not bad 
len ratingtwo The only issue I have with it is that every Time I go into a meeting for school the screen keeps going black randomly for seconds and is very annoying 
len ratingtwo This causes me miss attendance and get kicked out of class because I can t respond to the questions that my teachers ask me 
len ratingtwo Not opening whatsoever
len ratingfive I do my classes on teams
len ratingtwo  So umm the freezes a lot it s very glitchy and the sound is sometimes very slow it s very slow laggy
len ratingone I try open the app and immediately closed 
len ratingone Not possible 
len ratingone First the menu bar with hang up video mic and the three dots icons stays there with no option to remove it when seeing a slide in full mode then this fixed bar on top of that previous annoying one with all the faces or names of the participants that takes up all the screen space available for a presentation 
len ratingone Unbelievable 
len ratingone At least make them disappear after a few seconds and re appear when you touch the screen 
len ratingone Awful 
len ratingone I can t see anything on my iPhone anymore and hate having to connect w a laptop only to see better some freaking presentations 
len ratingfive It really effective and it has really helped me with my online class so yeah good job 
len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingfive Coming from the android version I feel that the iOS version works better 
len ratingfive Smooth and reliable 
len ratingfour So far I don t no how to do a meeting
len ratingfive It makes online school possible
len ratingfive I use Microsoft teams for school and it has been so beneficial to me 
len ratingfive There are so many cool features to this website and me and my friends love it a lot 
len ratingfive So thank you for creating this app Microsoft 
len ratingfive This app JAS been a game changer with our virtual environment 
len ratingfive Phone does not allow me to do backgrounds like the computer 
len ratingfive I like was surprised as to how seamless the transition was from Skype 
len ratingfive When Covid hit my customers bounced me around from Zoom to GoToMeeting and others 
len ratingfive When Teams hit it defiantly had learned from all the others short comings 
len ratingfive Teams is seemly on my PC and IPad 
len ratingfive Good job MS
len ratingone I constantly get notified that teams is pasting data from apps I was using previously without me using the paste function 
len ratingone The iPad App for Teams is still missing some features that the desktop and iPhone Team app have 
len ratingone Mainly when calling from Teams to a phone line you can not add a rd party 
len ratingone On an iPhone the People Icon is still there which allows you to add but on the iPad it is missing 
len ratingthree So during the COVID I had to download the app for school 
len ratingthree I was pretty impressed at this apps stuff but then ONCE I went into a meeting I was like This is bad 
len ratingthree The network was FINE last time I checked thank you 
len ratingthree But minutes to turn on stuff 
len ratingthree I HAVE SCHOOL 
len ratingthree It failed me once SPS please not twice 
len ratingthree Crashes a lot 
len ratingthree  features are great though 
len ratingfour I love the app and but it takes too long to download
len ratingfour I love this for team collaboration and communication but it would be great if I could edit all types of documents on the mobile app like I can on my desktop 
len ratingfour I m not able to edit PowerPoint files on the mobile app which is the majority of the files I m accessing collaborating on 
len ratingfour It truly a great thing
len ratingfour this app is totally good for studying for my children but i want to install it on my ipad but the problem is that its soo its old if you can please fix it 
len ratingfour i would give it stars if you do this for me so i can study on a bigger screen
len ratingtwo I was doing fine for months but then the app started to glitch and I can t attend my classes properly when ever I join a class it blacks out for a second and then I can t press anything and I have to close my iPad and then it kicks me out of the class this ONLY happens it your app and I can t do anything I ve tried to delete and reinstall but it it didn t work could you do something 
len ratingone  Every meeting it kicks me out
len ratingfive It works like its supposed to 
len ratingfive There is no higher praise than that when it comes to computer software 
len ratingfour I use this app every day at work to communicate better with coworkers 
len ratingfour It s been excellent for what we need to share documents and do video chats 
len ratingfour IMPROVEMENT STILL NEEDED 
len ratingfour I would really appreciate if the mobile app was capable of all the features that the desktop version is 
len ratingfour I m not able to create announcements in channels and can only create conversations 
len ratingfour If the desktop features were all available in the mobile apps this app would be PERFECT 
len ratingone  ONG NO I HATE THIS IS I GOT ALL MY INFORMATION STOLEN AND I ALMOST GOT KIDNAPPED FROM THIS OMG NEVER GET THIS 
len ratingthree Unable to use rear facing camera 
len ratingthree Otherwise a good app
len ratingone Teams was pretty good under iOS but on iOS it gets killed launching of the time 
len ratingone If it does open it is ok as long as it s in front but it s clearly using way to much memory because it gets killed as soon as it s backgrounder 
len ratingone If you are seeing this please rate it low I hate having school at my house and maybe you do too the more people the lower the rate and it might get taken down then we go for Zoom
len ratingfour This is a good app I use for school but in certain situations I cannot see meetings or I have other meeting connection problems
len ratingfive u du no they u ed to do it better
len ratingfive Fantastic app 
len ratingfive I love the interaction the interface and navigation 
len ratingtwo  Could you add chat option or auto reply for any calls that been trying to connect when I m in a meeting 
len ratingtwo I cannot rejected calls and I cannot hear the presenters voice 
len ratingtwo For your kind support
len ratingthree Overall I like this app and it seems to work well for our work meetings with so many of us working remotely 
len ratingthree However I cannot get the camera video to work on my iPhone 
len ratingthree I have checked all my settings and everything indicates it should work unless I missed something 
len ratingfive The Teams app has made it convenient to get the documents etc 
len ratingfive I need for my job and it has been good for my job s monthly team meetings 
len ratingfive Also it seems to be quick in communicating with my coworkers in other regions areas of Texas in asking questions while at a site or to help one another in computer related issues etc 
len ratingtwo The Lock Screen call controls e g 
len ratingtwo mute unmute disappeared when I downloaded iOS this week 
len ratingtwo Fix this and I give it stars love the teams app it s x better than the Skype mobile app 
len ratingthree Needs to work with AirPods
len ratingfour Swapping between teams and other app makes teams freeze and could not able to unmute it 
len ratingfour Either have close and reconnect or going to chat option and coming back 
len ratingfour In addition unable to delete close the complete chat screen 
len ratingone I just don t wanna go to school
len ratingtwo Aplicativo inst vel para aulas trava muito pesado 
len ratingtwo Do nada desabilita o chat o levantar a m o 
len ratingone Big dookie horrible
len ratingfour I ve been using teams for school for a long time and it s been great But when I don t finish an assignment or when I didn t even do it yet it hands it in by itself 
len ratingone I am mad
len ratingone  Doesn t open and often freezes 
len ratingone No update available
len ratingfive I love this app but the button to answer calls is on the wrong side 
len ratingfive I have to think to hard to answer a call otherwise I end up hitting end call and have to call or get a call back 
len ratingone  on a mobile device it will force you to buy the app instead of using safari because it wants free money and if i didn t need to use it for a friend then i would never get it 
len ratingone it also is very confusing to set up a call 
len ratingfour Seriously I have to install the edge browser to click directly into links 
len ratingfour I end up copy pasting the link into chrome for a workaround 
len ratingfour Didn t Microsoft learn anything from their shady browser hijinks in the s 
len ratingfive Very pleased with how the app operates 
len ratingfive I mostly use the calling individual chat and team chat features 
len ratingfive It also syncs up video meetings with my calendar which is nice 
len ratingfive Getting the whole team to transition here instead of regular email and calling is spotty but it s useful if you make the switch 
len ratingone  please take down this app i dont want to go to school please its ruining my mental health
len ratingfour I wish it was easier to share multiple photos instead of just one at a time 
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive Great calls meetings 
len ratingfive Love it and can t live without it 
len ratingfive Great job on building and constantly improving this 
len ratingone I am writing this review to complain about the horrible glitching that happens every morning 
len ratingone Each morning i go on teams for school and such however it seems every morning my screen just freezes and even while reloading over and over Ive tried turning my ipad off and on again restarting my entire ipad 
len ratingone i really hope that this problem will be fixed soon
len ratingone  keeps disconnecting
len ratingfour Would love to see a pin messages feature like in the desktop version 
len ratingfive Better and more secure than any other meeting platform for work
len ratingone iOS has a setting that prevents apps for asking for reviews or feedback which teams constantly ignores 
len ratingone I just want to use the app for work and quit being bothered about how much I like teams especially when I have explicitly told it to stop asking me 
len ratingone Are you out of ya darm head 
len ratingfive So very legendary smart app it is legendary
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive Love the new quality in videos 
len ratingfour Hello 
len ratingfour I m a student using Microsoft teams 
len ratingfour This app is really amazing for having online classes during coronavirus also I liked the new features of the update that all the participants shows all under 
len ratingfour Furthermore the issue that I m having is that I can t find the option to put a frame around me while opening my camera 
len ratingfour  I m using iPad please fix this problem I really love this app but I hate this issue that I m having a trouble in 
len ratingone Teams is extremely hard to understand as a student and was not helpful in anyway what so ever very much a disliked app
len ratingfour Nothing is perfect 
len ratingfour Still needs to have more functionality with OneDrive and more
len ratingfour I don t like that you cannot delete chats 
len ratingfour Some of them do not need stored becomes confusing and cluttered
len ratingfour I love when my teachers use the app but and I don t know why it won t let me use the chat feature whenever I use my phone 
len ratingfour Now it works perfectly fine on my computer but it just doesn t let me when I use the mobile version 
len ratingfour Other than that this is a great app 
len ratingone Extremely slow pretty much worthless 
len ratingone Takes a shorter amount of time for me to drive to my office fire up my PC log on to my VPN and respond to a chat than using the mobile version 
len ratingfive Works well for almost every single use 
len ratingfive If I had one ask it would be to make it easier to use both app and computer at the same time for A V
len ratingfive Great app for inter office communication 
len ratingfive Easy and works great on iPhone
len ratingfive Kudos to the app developers 
len ratingfive Works good very simple 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingone  Absolutely awful glitches every time I use it 
len ratingone Will never be used AGAIN 
len ratingfive It gets the job done
len ratingfour Why can t we pin anymore
len ratingthree I have an iPad Pro a lot of the features on the laptop cannot be preformed on the ipad 
len ratingthree  I have the full version tho 
len ratingthree  I cannot start a meeting 
len ratingthree The icon does not exist 
len ratingthree  I cannot end the meeting I can just close it 
len ratingthree  The sound is not working video if I put it in the keynote or even the PowerPoint inside the slide also from the gallery the sound is not working 
len ratingone  I have no clue why schools continue to use this app 
len ratingone It is slow and in every class there s at least one person who has an issue joining a meeting 
len ratingone There s also the issue of meetings not appearing sometimes the purple camera icon appears but when I tap it and it enters the channel and chat there is no meeting there nor is there a join button 
len ratingone Microsoft apps are always heavy and slow 
len ratingone Everything takes too long to load and this applies to the computer versions of the apps 
len ratingone TEAMS is not an exception 
len ratingone It is slow clunky and I really don t get why my school can t use something else 
len ratingthree Overall I like Teams but the meetings functionality needs to allow an option to call in for meetings 
len ratingthree Currently can only connect by the app or using audio microphone on computer 
len ratingthree This makes for terrible meeting experience users who use computer audio alone so sound distant others use app to speak and computer for visual but don t turn off computer speakers causing feedback 
len ratingthree And some of our contractors can t connect audio at all as app only allows single acct 
len ratingthree Having dial in option would solve most audio issues 
len ratingthree The statuses of people don t update unless you close out of the app and reopen 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingthree The app is great just wen I open it then it takes forever till it opens 
len ratingthree I m not saying that the app agh full is just IT WON T OPEN 
len ratingthree thats so bad that you cant delete a message you sent like i cant delete it thats my problem and everything else is good i hope u fix this and thank you and i didn t put stars because i cant delete the message i sent i hope you chance this thank you bye
len ratingfour Want an tap and hold button to talk option
len ratingone la odio
len ratingone  LET S UNITE AS ONE PERSON AND DELETE TEAMS 
len ratingone Es una porquer a
len ratingone  Se frisa a cada rato es muy lento ya Siempre esta fallando
len ratingfive This is a very helpful app for work 
len ratingfive The whole team is always connected 
len ratingfive We love the fact that we can keep the internal messages in this app that way we are not confused with client messages or emails 
len ratingfive I personally love the fact that different media can be shared and group chats can be created according to the teams necessities 
len ratingone Calidad p sima Las llamadas se caen f cilmente Si apagas el cel se corta la llamada 
len ratingone Gr ficos muy feos la maestras del ven como en minecraft y el sonido como si hubiera una avalancha Total estoy en el nivel y no puedo pasar porque aparece una tarea no entregada y sigo perdiendo puntos 
len ratingone Deber an mejorarla
len ratingone This app always gets bug and it doesn t let you do anything I couldn t even go to a class o hand my assignments 
len ratingone And also it confuses the teachers too they don t kwon how to used because of this problems
len ratingone Bad graphics smh 
len ratingone Too much ads 
len ratingone  The App bugs to much and doesn t work the majority of the time 
len ratingone Voy por el nivel y las recompensas son malas no puedo alimentar a los perros y hay muchas misiones como con n meros y otras de escribir
len ratingone Insulto a los helic pteros apaches tiene bits 
len ratingone  Esta app lo que hace es aumentar a la scuisidacion de muchas mujeres al a o NI UNA MENOS 
len ratingone Realmente Nesecito cancelar esto pues no me sirvi para absolutamente nada 
len ratingone Agradesco su atenci n 
len ratingone pinches clases
len ratingfour Would of been stars but this review interrupted me in the middle of work
len ratingone Muy mala de verdad 
len ratingone Se laguea mucho la skin gratuita de me deja ponerla es demasiado mala la app no la recomiendo para nada
len ratingone Skzkzlxnxbxc
len ratingthree There s a bit of everything but the kitchen sink going on in the interface which makes Teams both very useful and very difficult to use simultaneously 
len ratingthree The WORST thing though by far is the inability to delete messages chats event history 
len ratingthree I don t know which genius decided it would be great to have a list of old messages and chats lying around forever but it s visually horrible and so frustrating to not be able to just delete a chat 
len ratingthree I now no longer use it for chat only to schedule things 
len ratingfive It works for the level of complexity it provides 
len ratingone La app es p sima porque he tenido muchos problemas no me sirve el equipo menos el calendario 
len ratingfour When are you guys launching teams app for appleWatch
len ratingone No audio after last update 
len ratingfive This is a great app and I recommend
len ratingthree When I go on the app the icon that is for joining and creating teams does not appear can someone help me 
len ratingone  This is a terrible act 
len ratingone Can t I upload a file without an error 
len ratingone I am currently on the latest version and my MB file gives an error 
len ratingone If you want to use this app GOOD LUCK
len ratingone It cant run properly
len ratingthree The teams meeting app is great and helps me get to class everyday but that s not the point 
len ratingthree Every time I join the class meetings my screen goes crazy my screen keeps turning on and off and I can barely get my work done during class 
len ratingthree It s highly annoying and I just feel the need to leave class 
len ratingthree My phone tablet works perfectly fine until the teams meeting app came in 
len ratingthree It says the bugs are fixed but this bug isn t fixed 
len ratingthree Please get it fixed 
len ratingthree It s really annoying 
len ratingthree  I also tried re installing and that did not work 
len ratingone This app is in a bad layout the video quality is not good use a lot of graphic power the way worst than Zoom 
len ratingone When you assignment team works they will notify you whenever they want 
len ratingone Sometime can have one delay for days to show up the notification 
len ratingone Microsoft don t even need or have to get into this Territory for online virtual stuff 
len ratingone In conclusion bad design bad layout bad function 
len ratingone They tried to put everything in the app 
len ratingone And they ruined everything in the app 
len ratingone Besides they crashes sometimes 
len ratingfive Great app to answer a quick message 
len ratingfive  it 
len ratingfive I love to be able to conduct group meeting with all professionals in one setting 
len ratingfive A new vision of success with the virtual abilities this program offers 
len ratingone It crashes frequently 
len ratingone Also when you try to go to a different app your camera turns off 
len ratingone Some student keep kicking other students out of the calls muteing them and spotlight them 
len ratingone I would like for only the teacher to control who kicks and who mutes and spotlights
len ratingfive I love it that I have most of my Office apps all in one 
len ratingfive Teams Calendar and One Drive 
len ratingfive Makes work way easier and super efficient 
len ratingone School trash and teams trash
len ratingone It makes stress worst smh
len ratingone Works great on the computer 
len ratingone  shot I can t get into a meeting on the app 
len ratingone Very frustrating
len ratingfive Our business loves MS Teams 
len ratingfive It has changed the way we communicate 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and has robust features 
len ratingone NADA
len ratingfive  Our school uses teams especially during these tough times we are doing teams through online 
len ratingfive And it s great I have no problems with teams it s much better than zoom in pretty sure 
len ratingfive Love it it s so useful and helpful to do my assignments aswell 
len ratingone Bad I hate school 
len ratingthree  Pretty good 
len ratingthree Wish Ability to PLEASE forcibly mute someone and make that person STAY MUTED for GCC 
len ratingthree Think of the teachers PLEASE 
len ratingthree ALSO ability to send invite for someone to unmute themselves much like in Zoom 
len ratingthree You can request someone unmute themself and it sends them an invite 
len ratingthree Great for less tech savvy people 
len ratingone Esto es muy deprimente 
len ratingone Las gr ficas son muy malas y hay demasiados niveles 
len ratingone Es poco til 
len ratingone Tiene demasiados niveles y son muy dif ciles de pasar 
len ratingone Adem s se tarda mucho en llegar las cosas y cuando llegan llegan mal 
len ratingone En fin es innecesario y un fastidio total 
len ratingone The creator of this and the other programs app of his is hiding something from us You all have been warned 
len ratingone I had taken a risk for the safety of you guys 
len ratingone Don t trust him 
len ratingone I bet this review will get deleted 
len ratingfive Hdhdhejrj
len ratingfive Teams is Awesome 
len ratingfive  Especially the app 
len ratingfive Like that we can get together and keep in the loop of things going on
len ratingone  I m a th grader at my middle school and even I need to complain about some things 
len ratingone The reason I gave this a star was because of some of the things you guys need to improve on Could you guys add a delete your comment button 
len ratingone Today my iPad was laying on my keyboard and the button were pressed on and when I clicked off my meeting it was on my page 
len ratingone Everyone saw it so yeah I d like you to add that 
len ratingone Also the camera and mic glitch so can you fix that too 
len ratingone This would be my only complaints but beside that I d like everyone who s reading this to have a nice day 
len ratingone  And I ll change the stars when it s fixed
len ratingthree Muy buena la aplicaci n pero me gustar a que pusieran para celulares la habilidad de poner un background y poder compartir 
len ratingthree Gracias por leer
len ratingfive I love this app but with the next update make it to where you can delete the chats bc I have so many chats that take up room even if I hide them for school so that is something y all could figure out but I love this app
len ratingthree Functionality is good 
len ratingthree But audio only mode would be great to save battery 
len ratingthree Two meetings have dropped my battery life to percent and it s only two hours into the business day 
len ratingone  Must get backgrounds on IOS
len ratingfour Not all these th graders coming to try and dent the customer review with their I hate school reviews 
len ratingfour Anyways this is a pretty cool app 
len ratingfour It s better than zoom imo 
len ratingfour It is tricky to get the hang of at first though mostly because of the lack of training before the district had our school use this as our live classtime platform 
len ratingfour The only issue I have is recently it s been seriously bugging out 
len ratingfour Yesterday classes had to be cancelled and due dates delayed which is cool yes but not for when we still have to do the lessons crammed into time later 
len ratingfour today most of the students could get on but this morning the app on my ipad stopped letting me in 
len ratingfour I m about to see if it let s me in now that I ve redownloaded it but if not I ve lost my backup plan for when the school s global protect stops working again 
len ratingfour Edit no it did not let me in 
len ratingfour Microsoft please fix this or if there is a way to troubleshoot that would be cool 
len ratingone It s trash
len ratingone Great app but they are using your mic even when you muted it
len ratingtwo Kicks you off regularly can t see all of the participants not customizable poor video quality need it go on 
len ratingfive Hello
len ratingtwo Using this app on an iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and there is a significant lag when typing chats or posts which makes the app almost useless 
len ratingtwo Unacceptable 
len ratingthree Sharing screens on teams video doesn t compete with MS Teams 
len ratingthree Lagging etc 
len ratingfive Fills a communication coordination link formerly vacant within our team 
len ratingfive Our team value and impact has increased dramatically 
len ratingone I just don t wanna do any schoolwork
len ratingfive More important now than ever before to be part of Teams Video Voice Chat on the go all in one app
len ratingone So far have mixed results 
len ratingone Could move from room to room but no picture 
len ratingone Then got picture but couldn t move to another room 
len ratingone Now it looks like I ll miss the meeting I originally signed in for altogether 
len ratingone I am not pleased 
len ratingfive Teams allowed my coworkers and I to transition from the office to home and maintain our continuity 
len ratingfive We proved we can get the work done no matter we are 
len ratingtwo The app version of Teams is absolutely not scheduling friendly 
len ratingtwo As a supervisor at my job I am in charge of scheduling the employees under me 
len ratingtwo It is nearly impossible to do so on the app version having to type in each employees name and their hours only to have it be shared immediately to them rather than just saved until shared 
len ratingtwo Then after sharing it takes you back to today s date rather than the date you were just working on 
len ratingtwo Scheduling on the desktop version is so much better but I am currently using an iPad as my laptop 
len ratingtwo I really hope this app is updated to make scheduling significantly easier on mobile 
len ratingfive Administration privileges plz
len ratingtwo don t like the new update
len ratingone Most of the time the screen freezes no matter what making it almost unusable
len ratingone I like it but it sometimes glitches please try to fix that
len ratingone It s a slack knock off that gets about of the way there 
len ratingone Only exists because orgs are willing to skimp on their internal tooling 
len ratingfour I d really like Teams to notify me of meetings on my calendar Teams or otherwise 
len ratingfour Love love this app 
len ratingfour However I just recently discovered that there is no way to reset your pin for the Safe feature 
len ratingfour  if they can fix that it ll be on point 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone Bunu biz ili dir nin nk b y s n sikim
len ratingtwo For some reason sometimes when I listen to a call by my airpods the voice starts to glitch 
len ratingtwo And when I remove it it becomes normal 
len ratingtwo It s second generation airpods 
len ratingfour Dumb requirement
len ratingone Ye
len ratingthree While this app is very useful especially now that i have to use it for school I ALWAYS have bugs and yes my iPad and app are always up to date every time they get rid of one bug another comes in 
len ratingthree My newest bug is I can t upload my assignments the button that says Attach just isn t there anymore so now cant upload my assignments and that is very frustrating for me because i have to turn in my work 
len ratingtwo I just switched from Android to iPhone and I set up quiet hours on both Teams and Outlook but I still get badges when I get an email 
len ratingtwo Which never happened on Android 
len ratingtwo Is there a way to stop this 
len ratingtwo I don t want to turn them off all the time just after working hours 
len ratingone I don t like school 
len ratingfive The more I use it the more I enjoy using it 
len ratingone i hate this thing SO much 
len ratingone periodt
len ratingfour There is something you need to fix 
len ratingfour The camera 
len ratingfour When ever I turn on my camera it doesn t do anything 
len ratingtwo The app is great and useful but I have this annoying problem that whenever I m on a call my screen starts turning black at random intervals and it won t stop 
len ratingtwo It makes doing things while using teams difficult 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingone  It would not let me join a meeting and I am online for school in Nashville so if you miss a ton of school you can go to jail
len ratingfive Microsoft teams was great before the pandemic 
len ratingfive There was a period during the pandemic where zoom stole the show 
len ratingfive I m glad the Microsoft team quickly made updates that in my opinion makes Teams far superior than zoom 
len ratingfive They took things from Zoom they should ve had in the first place but that s besides the point 
len ratingfive Based on my experience this is the most efficient way of doing business in groups 
len ratingfive The video and audio calls work well 
len ratingfive I recommend Microsoft teams without any reservation 
len ratingfive I am sure down the road we will have better platforms but for now this is my pick 
len ratingfive Morie Alo
len ratingfive So much better then Skype and Google Meets
len ratingone THIS IS A NO FOR ME
len ratingone i don t vibe with this so it s a no from me
len ratingone just no 
len ratingone It is horrible it is dumb stupid
len ratingone First it was so good but now it s not it started to open the mic instantly without me wanting to and open the camera when ever it wants actually I can close it back but why does it even do this 
len ratingone It glitches a lot now and if you say it s a problem in my phone Nope it s still in new condition it s working perfectly in every app except for this I dunno maybe cause it s apple s iPad Pro and teams are not that good on iPhone 
len ratingone Cause there is lots and lots of problems 
len ratingfive Good app quality might not be so good but it suits for important stuff like school or work or if you have something important to tell your family or anyone or even just a talk anyways it s a good app and the problems come only from the greatness of the wifi
len ratingone lolz i rated you a star for my school bc i get anxiety while my class 
len ratingfive Teams is super useful quick and easy I use it especially in the time of pandemic and is very useful to communicate with team members so we all are updated quickly and effectively 
len ratingfive Cheers Microsoft Teams I use it everyday 
len ratingone Never works always glitches and is burden to deal with
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone  It s been months since the pandemic where is virtual background for iOS teams 
len ratingone How long does it take a Microsoft team engineers to add the feature to add customized backdrop change loop video clip and picture to the phone app 
len ratingone Never 
len ratingone Come on guys it s not that hard to code and it s an important feature to have 
len ratingone Any other group video chat apps out there can do that already 
len ratingone Do you guys really want to wait till the Pandemic is over and then add this feature 
len ratingfour This is feedback on Teams in general not the app 
len ratingfour Please for the live if god allow me to 
len ratingfour Delete e mails with a typo rather than keeping the incorrect and the corrected versions 
len ratingfour Once people have been added to a team generate a drop down menu of all of them to be checked off when I generate a meeting invite 
len ratingfour I am managing events w people on one team and to have to type the addresses for every merging invite is ridiculous 
len ratingfive Awesome way to give lectures and communicate with your group 
len ratingfive On the go or at home you will never miss a class
len ratingfour  Jad program but you get a problem that all lama speak Mike is locked 
len ratingfour And this is something wrong that becomes Hatta when I speak all hear me and Mike is locked
len ratingfive Great app and with excellent tools to work anywhere 
len ratingfive It s a dream mobile office that let you keep in touch with co workers and customers conduct meetings and let you share screen whenever needed or for training 
len ratingfive Definitely very productive love it and recommend it 
len ratingthree  Nose es buena pero se traba mucho y pues te saca de la clase y pues para los maestros es dif cil y lo de poder proyectar las im genes es horrible ya que se ve en negro o sale cargando o sino se queda trabado Decearia que lo arreglaran 
len ratingfive Excellent very functional
len ratingone delete this app please 
len ratingone I am a child who is very dissatisfied with this app 
len ratingone Assignments tab never loads 
len ratingone I personally think of my self as a teacher s pet 
len ratingone I m always on task correcting or helping her finish words when her tongue is tied and I m the smartest kid in all of th grade 
len ratingone Teams acts like I m disconnected ALL THE TIME 
len ratingone I also always have to restart my device because of this 
len ratingone My WiFi is great and sometimes I m actually sitting RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WiFi BOX 
len ratingone It always does that I m always and never won t be restarting my device every TEN MINUTES 
len ratingone It never works or it will but only for a small amount of time 
len ratingone I REALLY need that fixed and until I m gonna go on campus and I might have to go on campus next quarter but for the time being I m gonna pray and hope it starts working 
len ratingone  An Angry th Grade Hooman 
len ratingone I NEED TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE CREATORS OF THIS APP RIGHT NOW 
len ratingone THIS APP HAS HACKED EVER SINCE I DOWNLOADED IT 
len ratingone THE SECURITY OUT ON THIS APP IS OUTRAGEOUS 
len ratingone MY DOG ALSO DIED BECUZ OF THIS APP 
len ratingone I HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPERIENCING DIARRHEA TOO MUCH AND I KNOW THIS APP IS THE CAUSE OF IT sincerely biden 
len ratingfour Love being anywhere virtually and able to communicate with all staff 
len ratingfive Rated the app so you would stop asking me to rate it 
len ratingfive With remote work on the rise this app helps me connect at work 
len ratingfour I wish this feature could be disabled 
len ratingfour Just because I m away from my desk doesn t mean I m not available With the way people work now it s misleading and honestly counter productive when there is a literal app that goes with you everywhere 
len ratingfour Microsoft we are begging you PLEASE LET US DECIDE WHEN TO BE AWAY 
len ratingfive Teams App and Teams Chat on my laptop are in sync 
len ratingfive So I set notifications on the app and I get the messages when I am on another screen on the laptop 
len ratingfive Works very well 
len ratingfour It s a little hard to navigate on the app through many different teams and channels but overall still helps with productivity 
len ratingfour This is great 
len ratingfour One feature that I like is how it will update appointment meeting times to change to whenever time zone you are in 
len ratingfour I wish it would have EST CST MST PST next to the the meeting times just so people who don t realize that Microsoft teams adjusts are not confused
len ratingfive The app is really nice and I use it for school but the only thing I don t like about this application is that I m not able to lower the volume 
len ratingfive The only options I have is mute and speaker which is really loud on my IPad 
len ratingfour The app works well for the most part but you cannot join the meeting if the instructor starts recording 
len ratingfour Also the meetings behave like phone calls rather than video calls meaning that if you move your phone around sometimes the screen will go black 
len ratingone I have to use it for school and it works terribly 
len ratingone Even on the computer it constantly crashes and I cannot complete my work 
len ratingthree It would be awesome if there was a means to join a teams meeting from inside the tool instead of must us the link from the meeting invite and a redirect from that 
len ratingone  The new update now took away the option of seeing your Teams contact list under the chat tab 
len ratingone Now all you can see are your recent conversations instead of being able to click at the top and see your contact list you previously created 
len ratingfour If only Teams would let me share recorded sessions without external participants would be so very helpful 
len ratingfour Then I d rate stars 
len ratingfive Excellent app for purposes
len ratingone randomly kicks you off 
len ratingone garbage 
len ratingone BUUUUU abuso infantil NOALASCLASESONLINE
len ratingtwo no issues with the Teams app itself it runs well and does it job 
len ratingtwo However I am a part of multiple organisations that use teams and need access to all of them at the same time teams doesn t allow this 
len ratingtwo Instead having to log in and out of different organisation emails means that I miss notifications for the others and it may sound lazy but it is a bit of a hassle as I have three organisation emails that I need to constantly rotate 
len ratingtwo If I can have multiple emails on one app why can t I have multiple organisations on teams 
len ratingtwo Teams is nice but still is the stone in the shoe when you don t hit it the shoe feels great but when you hit it oh god 
len ratingfour Gave a four star rating since I m still learning technology I wanted to reserve a star once I have more knowledge
len ratingfive I don t say this about Microsoft very often but they have nailed the Teams App 
len ratingfive It s cross platform compatibility and the ease of use has made this app essential for staying in communication with coworkers who are working from home 
len ratingone Always lagging
len ratingone Nos obligan a coger algo llamado clases somos esclavos de nosotros mismos deber an eliminar la app
len ratingthree Ok so I was heading to class normal morning but Microsoft s was being wayy to slow I clicked something and it didn t work 
len ratingthree Keep in mind my class already started it s also took me out of class and way more 
len ratingthree I don t know what to do because of this I m going to be late also this has happened for days terrible even when I m not able to mute or get on chat and more 
len ratingthree Terrible 
len ratingfive I wish I could see the Task and check list as well from the scheduler app 
len ratingfive  but Team has been good to keep track conversations
len ratingfive Wow communicate with or whole team the possibilities of up to minute communication are perfect in my HIPAA Compliant workplace 
len ratingfive Posts for immediate need are received and responded to with ease
len ratingone When you go to join a meeting it gives you the prompt screen to join now On this screen it lets you choose whether to start with microphone and camera off or on 
len ratingone With both turned off it still turns microphone when you join microphone 
len ratingone It s silly that this is an issue 
len ratingfive I hate school jojo pose 
len ratingone I hate my school homework class work especially math class I mean bruh be cuz of my school I hate this app and I do lag in the app soooo many times I hate this app cuz of my school
len ratingone  Notifications stick between accounts with no way to clear 
len ratingone Which means I am stuck in a cycle of hell where I have to constantly go into the app and check both of my accounts with each of them showing the stuck notifications as coming from the other 
len ratingone I got bitched out by a client last week for not being responsive enough because I got too relaxed about checking the ghost notifications assuming there wasn t actually a message 
len ratingone FIX 
len ratingone THIS 
len ratingone  This makes notification cards worthless 
len ratingone One doesn t even know who wrote or who s call was missed 
len ratingone It means we as business users have to behave like teenagers on Facebook glued to and opening every message to see if it s important 
len ratingone This not only marks it as Read already but it also is a waste of time and a HUGE disruption to productivity and focus 
len ratingone Please at least make it so the cards have to show who was involved 
len ratingone NSA level security for all businesses outside of such ones for a card that already is authenticated via faceID and should just show us the information is too much 
len ratingone Companies are removing all information from the cards even after faceID has authenticated the user 
len ratingone The app really loses its value in today s modern world 
len ratingthree  After upgrading to IOS the control call no longer shows up on locked screen 
len ratingfour Open photo library freezes and hangs the app 
len ratingfour Please test your releases 
len ratingfour I know MS has only been doing software development for a short time and it s all a learning curve 
len ratingfour So test step press buttons 
len ratingfour See if they break anything 
len ratingone I gave it because I couldn t give le di uno porque no se puede dar 
len ratingone How can Microsoft missed delete option for conversation 
len ratingfive This has been a real lifesaver in terms of covering my butt 
len ratingfive The functionality and accessibility couldn t be easier to learn 
len ratingfive Formatting and integration is precisely what I needed for working out of the office 
len ratingthree App would be a lot better if I received a notification when someone puts a message on the channel 
len ratingthree Yes my notifications are turned on in the app as well as settings 
len ratingfive An excellent user friendly product 
len ratingone The system was not easy to use 
len ratingone Was not able to get it to work
len ratingone After the new Apple update and using the screen share tool the recording stops and also when using more than one screen on the iPad screen sharing does not work We hope for a quick solution given that we use TMS on a daily basis with education
len ratingfive This is an amazing app but I do have one thing to say about this which is bad it sometimes does kick me out but I use this for school every single day so I would say this is a great app even though it kicks me out to times a day but it s amazing
len ratingone  I would rated it but it wouldn t let me
len ratingfive Was a bit hesitant to load onto my phone but do glad I did 
len ratingfive Works better than off my laptop minus a reasonable size screen 
len ratingfive Having a notification right in your pocket wherever you are is such an asset for upcoming meetings 
len ratingfive Would love to be able to plug into just a tablet or monitor for viewing presenter screens otherwise A TEAMS team 
len ratingfive Teams app works much better on mobile I m using iphone than on desktop app video quality better no lag or constant freezes
len ratingone It is so easy to get hacked if it s a school account
len ratingone horrible
len ratingone It s been working fine on my ipad until this morning 
len ratingone It won t start now 
len ratingone i ve cleared data reinstalled the app but nothing worked 
len ratingone I missed my online class 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone It s got a lot of cool features but it crashes all the time especially since the last update
len ratingfive Clear and pristine voice and sound the conversation is well received 
len ratingtwo Teams is a great tool for those inside your corporate computing environment 
len ratingtwo But try to add short term seasonal help or short term project based multi company teams and forget it 
len ratingtwo Guests are dead in the water 
len ratingfive Love how easy it is to schedule call or add someone to a TEAMS meeting 
len ratingthree  Ty
len ratingfour The app is great it s just that sometimes it s not letting me turn my camera and is always off even when I enter with my camera on it s still off 
len ratingfour Overall it s a great app 
len ratingfour Spent way too much time logging in now every day 
len ratingthree Causes significant battery drain on iOS OS devices during conferencing regardless of WiFi or Cellular connection 
len ratingthree When on the go during conferencing this makes using it less desirable 
len ratingthree I should say that being able to save files communicate with coworkers and send attachments securely is great 
len ratingfour Too bad you can t do either actions in this App
len ratingone  I do not like that teachers can login your account and see what you ve been doing
len ratingfive If people talk about meeting and social distancing 
len ratingfive Guess what this thingy is the thing in all level of individuals and professionals 
len ratingfive Try it it s worth the outcome
len ratingone La aplicaci n esta rotisima tarda mucho en meterte el teclado se mueve como quiera a veces te pone la version de USA y deja de funcionar al meterte al link te saca de la aplicaci n y a si hasta un tiempo no se las recomiendo
len ratingfive More than a tool for quick chat video meetings and sharing 
len ratingfive One of the best in market 
len ratingone  This app has a terribly slow upload speed and fails to upload on a file MB or greater 
len ratingone This app is useless and really serves no purpose except wasting your life 
len ratingone Warning DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP
len ratingone it s trash and it s laggy and difficult to use 
len ratingone Time and time again it s a toss up as to whether this app will show me my class meetings 
len ratingone This happens on my phone and computer 
len ratingone It will show me only the first meeting from the beginning of the year and then when you click into it it shows that the class is being recorded but I still cannot join 
len ratingone This is an every other day occurrence and sometimes every day occurrence 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone Boooo
len ratingthree In Skype I was able to join several meetings via chat and one with audio screen 
len ratingthree On teams I can only join one meeting 
len ratingthree If I join a second one then the first one is on hold 
len ratingone yes
len ratingthree It s not clear how to attach a photo to a chat with my bank cell 
len ratingfour excellent form of team communication and transfer sharing of information 
len ratingfour Would have given stars if not for the inability to delete chats 
len ratingfour Old chats takes up too much real estate 
len ratingthree  Ok so I was heading to class normal morning but Microsoft s was being wayy to slow I clicked something and it didn t work 
len ratingthree Keep in mind my class already started it s also took me out of class and way more 
len ratingthree I don t know what to do because of this I m going to be late also this has happened for days
len ratingthree Why haven t they fixed the fact that when you are on your phone your camera gets zoomed in so far the other person sees only your forehead but on your screen everything looks normal 
len ratingthree Please fix
len ratingone This app constantly is dropping all my calls when I am trying to be in class 
len ratingone I m not trying to sound too complainy since I use it to go to school but I genuinely think it s a bad way of learning 
len ratingone It s always glitching on me and never letting me open what I need 
len ratingone This app is just not it 
len ratingone Sorry Microsoft 
len ratingfive Recently we have been using virtual school due to the pandemic and I left my computer and now I can get to virtual school with my phone this is completely free and handy when your on trips and have school work 
len ratingone Creo que todos sabemos por qu la odio y si una app tiene una estrella la eliminan haci que qu est s esperando dale la peor rese a gracias por leer
len ratingone Microsoft teams hampers the freedom of students significantly and that it spoils us the next generation of students 
len ratingfour Pretty good but many technical glitches
len ratingfive Ok well App for school so that s pretty good able to call my friends all my teachers we needed able to do small groups and all my classes nothing I wanna know is why do I have to except my classes on my email instead of actually cut my classes on the teams like excepting my classes at the except those on my email not the actual teams what is good so far
len ratingfour Teams is very easy to use 
len ratingfour Everything in one area 
len ratingone Es mal sima y se frisa demasiado 
len ratingone If we get a star review this app will get taken off the App Store 
len ratingone So star this
len ratingfive I work odd hours it would be awesome to have more customizable quiet hours specific to every day 
len ratingfive Otherwise this seems like a gem 
len ratingfive And cheaper than Slack 
len ratingfive Teams is really a great way to communicate 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive Only suggestion is maybe a way to delete individual messages in a chat 
len ratingtwo So the volume lowers and I can t see or here and it kicks me out and it unmutes me and there are echoes
len ratingfour It s just a little complicated in my option zoom is less confusing
len ratingfour I use teams for work and it s a pain getting people into your team but once they re in it s the perfect tool to get work done in 
len ratingfour Quality and user experience for video audio conferencing messaging and files collaboration is great 
len ratingfour I like that I can join an Outlook scheduled meeting from the same account on different devices and another attendee isn t shown 
len ratingfour With calls made directly from the Teams app it doesn t not appear I can join the call from another device bummer 
len ratingfour I hate having to log in with extra authentication 
len ratingfour It s annoying 
len ratingfour Please incorporate biometrics so my fingerprint can just get me in 
len ratingfour Can you please make this app where we can put in our school email so I don t have to keep looking back at teachers screen and going back to mine 
len ratingfour What I am trying to say Is I want to use my phone to video and use my laptop to do work 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams has brought great features to the virtual meeting place and amazing protection for all the content within it 
len ratingfive Email messaging meetings and voice all packed inside this genie 
len ratingfive The upgrade to store phone numbers is great
len ratingone I use this app for online class it was going good until all of these bugs came their were lags and some of my classmates are getting muted even tho no one muted them so I have to say the app needs improvement and fix bugs thank you
len ratingfive Chat calendar video conference and more this is a tool that works 
len ratingfive Thanks Microsoft for creating a fantastic usable TEAM app 
len ratingone Compared to other collaborating software Teams screenshare freezes very often 
len ratingone I would rather use other software like skype jabber or zoom 
len ratingone Never had a problem with those 
len ratingfive Better on mobile
len ratingfive Teams is my new best friend 
len ratingfive Not only is it full of features but the rapid release of new features makes it seem powerful 
len ratingfive My project management efficiency has significantly improved 
len ratingfive Kudos 
len ratingfour I regularly run audio through my phone while watching presentations and or sharing my screen from my laptop 
len ratingfour Joining the meeting on both devices is usually pretty painless 
len ratingfour However I have a lot more trouble with phone calls 
len ratingfour If I answer a Teams call on my phone the only way that I know to share my screen from my laptop is to start a new conversation or call from my laptop 
len ratingfour I wish I could just join the call on my laptop like I do with meetings 
len ratingfive I like the fact that I have constant contact with the rest of my team 
len ratingfour I ve been using teams for a while almost a few years and I think that it s a really good app for school work or whatever you use it for 
len ratingfour I mostly use it fo online school and it help organize a lot of my work 
len ratingfour The only thing is that there are frequent glitches and it makes it hard to do my work 
len ratingfour Most of the videos that I get sent don t load and it used to be a once in a while thing but now none of the videos load 
len ratingfour The space is left blank 
len ratingfour I ve tried many things and none of them work 
len ratingfour It also crashes randomly and more frequently goes to a blank screen freezes up or just crashes while I mi n the middle of something 
len ratingfour But other than that I think that teams is a very good app and would recommend it if they would fix some of the glitches 
len ratingfive The Microsoft Teams app is so awesome 
len ratingfive This app allows everyone to stay in real time contact have calls instant messages as well as the ability to update your status and display a message such as out to lunch and even DND Do not disturb 
len ratingfive The best part with status is you can have a message display to those who message you while your away to see when you ll be back and if you are out for the rest of the day and who your back up is etc 
len ratingfive This is perfect for the current times of Covid as well as everyday business 
len ratingone Everyone is jumping on the teams bandwagon 
len ratingone I don t see why 
len ratingone Here s the down and dirty can t play meeting recordings on phone via the app 
len ratingone Tells you to go online for the desktop then tells you to download the app again 
len ratingone Dumb 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone  not user friendly too many steps to make things happen 
len ratingone Zoom s interface is waaaaay better 
len ratingone Very simple 
len ratingone  customer service is shotty at best 
len ratingone They don t respond fast at all 
len ratingfive As far as I am concern MS Teams is getting better for our office use in keeping in touch with our co workers 
len ratingfour I ve been using this app for school and it works great 
len ratingfour All the features work nicely except that whenever I try to multitask open another app while on the call the iPad camera turns off by itself 
len ratingfour Microsoft teams or Apple should change this feature because it affects a lot of iPad users 
len ratingfour This issue is common with video platforms like Google Meets Teams and Zoom 
len ratingfive This app really gets the job done it does its job and that s all I can really say 
len ratingfive Ever since the pandemic first happened this app has help me to keep my education where I like it 
len ratingfive I also like it because it let me use my emojis 
len ratingfive This app is coo and I would totally recommend this app to anyone that is interested or curious
len ratingthree Here let verify your access to this account by entering a password but by correctly entering a password we have to verify that as well so now you have to enter a verification code every hours 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingone  In iPad I can t use a meeting in app
len ratingthree Playing videos or picture slide shows are choppy 
len ratingone Hey i have most recent ipad pro but guess what i keeps freezing 
len ratingone All I can do is just listening 
len ratingone I can not interact 
len ratingtwo Had to download this to talk with a client 
len ratingtwo It works better than Googlemeet but is very attention seeking 
len ratingtwo By the time I had downloaded it twice set up an account and got into the meeting late it kept trying to interrupt me to install other versions and get to know teams 
len ratingtwo My wife uses it at work and says she liked it 
len ratingtwo It may be ok eventually but my first impression can only be described in impolite terms 
len ratingone Microsoft team IOS app is not able to login even thought I did try uninstall change password reboot my phone 
len ratingone On the other hand it will not remove the previous account I logged in after I uninstall the app 
len ratingfive Amazing tool very productive and stable 
len ratingfive I am an AirPod user and with Teams I have to be attached to the device to mute 
len ratingfive Quite uncomfortable 
len ratingfive Cheers
len ratingone Ever since your new update I can t even open the app 
len ratingone It just stays on your logo forever 
len ratingone Fix it please I can t even take school because of this problem 
len ratingfive Sujshe
len ratingthree So far the performance is great 
len ratingthree But I wish that the division of screens are flexible for those people to be able to move around 
len ratingone The app no longer syncs to my account 
len ratingone I have tried logging out uninstalling l etc 
len ratingone It s like days behind and doesn t show all the messages 
len ratingtwo i use it for school and to talk with my friends but it lags sometimes it doesn t let me call my friend but now its been minutes trying to call my friend it keeps saying disconnected but i try again and the same thing happens i close my ipad and open it again i close the internet and open it again sorry for my grammar 
len ratingthree I d say it s good but the blocked list is kinda annoying because even if you get rid of the app your still on it but it only happened because I put the wrong thing to many times and on computer I cant change my profile pic but maybe that s only me
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfive It hasn t misbehaved terribly yet so far 
len ratingfive We use it to collaborate at work 
len ratingfive I like how when you mention someone s name they automatically get added to the thread 
len ratingfour Uploads are sluggish 
len ratingfour Bottleneck 
len ratingfour Audio playback mov file h on iPhone MUTE 
len ratingfour But when re sending same file using Whatsup works 
len ratingfour This is like Skype with Steroid just need a bit more 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone This used to be a amazing app with super high speeds until people started returning to school Its not my device ether because I m on a iPad th gen and I expected better because this has stars and I cant even use it because every time I try it just says its loading also I m not inpatient I waited one hour and twenty four ministers and it kept loading nothing 
len ratingone Dodo
len ratingfour  So ive been using Microsoft for a week for th grade and it has been great the audio is good and the camera too but Put a whiteboard in the app because app for it is annoying 
len ratingfour Thats all i have to say
len ratingfive  stars
len ratingone i ve been using teams for a while now for school and on the computer it constantly crashes and on my phone 
len ratingone i have tried multiple ways to fix this but nothing works 
len ratingone  out of stars would not recommend
len ratingthree I use both the desktop MSTeams and the mobile version 
len ratingthree For the mobile version I d like to suggest adding a quick way to silence the alerts from the chat function 
len ratingthree When it s running in the background or if I m multitasking it chews up the battery and makes it nearly impossible to answer a voice call 
len ratingfour I get an error message when I try and open a file in an app from Teams 
len ratingfour It says I don t have permission 
len ratingfive it kills the memory of the computer
len ratingthree I really like this app 
len ratingthree As a teacher tough I find it ridiculous that i cannot download my recorded lessons on my iPad or download the attendees sheet into an excel sheet from the app itself 
len ratingthree Most importantly why cant i even upload a word document or PowerPoint from my iPad 
len ratingfive  I use this app for online school
len ratingfour I know the meeting is recorded 
len ratingfour Now let me click the x at the top right to dismiss the notification without swapping apps looking at the attendee list or meeting chat
len ratingfive Incredibly user friendly very efficient for larger teams 
len ratingone This app is so trash it kicks me out for no reason my WiFi is fine like what u going to do to fix it 
len ratingone Huh
len ratingfive It s a great communication tool 
len ratingfive  Provides users with tremendous flexibility in how to collaborate remotely 
len ratingfour Need to add ability to use custom virtual backgrounds like from the desktop version 
len ratingone  When ever I m in a Microsoft teams call some times my screen blacks out and brings my brightness all the way up and hurt my eyes I would like if you respond to this and fix it
len ratingone Fisher Price icons terrible use of memory a dialog box at nags me after every call I don t think it s worse than Lotus Notes but it s pretty darn close 
len ratingone Teams is a flaming piece of garbage that I do not recommend 
len ratingone I highly recommend using JITSI which is much nicer 
len ratingfour I really like Teams 
len ratingfour My only issue is that when trying to update shared Microsoft Office files it freezes up 
len ratingfour I ve experienced with Excel Word and Power Point 
len ratingfour You can share and move around 
len ratingfour But if you try to update any or filter in Excel it freezes 
len ratingthree Whenever I start the app it does that loading thing at the top left corner but whenever I go to press anything in the app it crashes and I have tried everything from refreshing the app to reinstalling it but it doesn t seem to work 
len ratingthree I have classes and I cannot be late because of this issue but otherwise it is a pretty decent app 
len ratingfive  um good app yeah yeah 
len ratingone I only gave it a one star because I don t like school 
len ratingfour This app works great except for one rather large issue I have 
len ratingfour It would be amazing if there was an option to start a meeting from my iPad or mobile device 
len ratingfour I am a PE teacher and am always on the go and the last thing I need to worry about is hauling around a laptop in order to start a class meeting 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive God man I CANT EVEN DOWNLOAD THIS THING
len ratingone This app kept on asking for personal info like my address I pray this will get fixed
len ratingfive I think it s a very good app 
len ratingfive I find it very useful due to the COVID pandemic 
len ratingfive That I m able to train my colleagues virtually 
len ratingfive So idk if it only happens to me but on mobile it freezes 
len ratingfive Alot 
len ratingfive I need to reset the app if I want to go to a different button chat teams activity etc 
len ratingfive Thats the only problem 
len ratingfive Overall its an amazing app 
len ratingfive I can talk to people and find them easier rather than asking my friends their phone number in person 
len ratingfive App is easy to use
len ratingfive I work for a large company and having to setup virtual meetings can be a hassle 
len ratingfive Microsoft Team s easy to use interface has made life so much easier for me 
len ratingfive Joining and starting a meeting from my phone is just as easy as sitting at my desk 
len ratingfive I would highly recommend 
len ratingone This app used to work great until I clicked a link to join a meeting a few minutes before and it would not let me in I selected the join a meeting option and it said I needed to click a link to join
len ratingone Bad crashes too much
len ratingone The app was having issues kept asking to put password Wouldn t let me log in as a guest 
len ratingone It constantly freezes and always drains my charge and over heats my devices 
len ratingone But the most resent issue is the logging in 
len ratingone I like teams it s nice and easy to use on my iPad but since mid September of this year I ve had problems of teams randomly but usually while in a meeting just lag out and crash 
len ratingone And I have to restart the app and rejoin the meeting which is a pain sometimes 
len ratingone Then I miss some instructions the teacher said when teams crashed 
len ratingone Overall teams is nice to use but has some big performance issues 
len ratingone I m not even in a meeting and it just crashes 
len ratingone Please try to improve this 
len ratingone Edit Teams crashed times in one meeting 
len ratingone  TIMES 
len ratingone HI YES I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE INSTEAD OF RELOADING TEAMS EVRY MINUTE THANKS 
len ratingone Oh wait it will probably never get fixed like any of my problems on teams 
len ratingone Oh well 
len ratingone But please this is extremely frustrating and it seems to get worse 
len ratingfour  The crater need to put background on iPad and phone and 
len ratingfour Teams is good for meeting but it s annoying like people keep sending massages like they are doing like those pictures and funny stuffs crater can u do please wait sec to chat 
len ratingfour Becuse people are keep doing that are not we are doing in class 
len ratingfour And Teams is good 
len ratingfour And great sorry if I am being mean or salty 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingtwo In a school setting when trying to do therapy this app lacks a lot 
len ratingtwo There s usually a lag between the voice and the video 
len ratingtwo The video quality is usually poor 
len ratingtwo There s no way to annotate on shared pages and when sharing pages it s very Slow to appear on the others screen 
len ratingtwo It often cuts off part of your head or makes peoples heads bigger 
len ratingtwo When sharing screens it s difficult to share two screens at the same time and you can t see the attendees when you re sharing your screen 
len ratingtwo I do hope they fix this up as we have no choice in using it 
len ratingfive We started a new law firm right at the beginning of the pandemic and started using teams to keep us together and it is now a central part of our practice 
len ratingone Trash
len ratingone  AppStore rating is not correct at all 
len ratingone Simple login as guest is not working and app crashes frequently im wondering how did this app get rating 
len ratingfour But I can t sign in into my Microsoft account
len ratingthree I can hardly join any active meetings for some reason I cannot see the join option or even the fact that there is a meeting being held 
len ratingthree It would also be helpful to get a notification when meetings start like on the desktop app 
len ratingone I want you to make this bad app to update every day and I HaTe school 
len ratingone No cuh y all need to fix dat app cuz I need to be able to chat with the students and the teachers that mad aggravating like why dey disable it 
len ratingfive Very helpful to my work and interaction with others 
len ratingfive Comprehensive features 
len ratingfive The only challenge is the connection quality our Firewall here may affect pretty badly 
len ratingfive In general great effort from Microsoft 
len ratingfive I only wish everyone in our company used it 
len ratingfive Teams makes life easier to communicate quickly and efficiently 
len ratingfive This is a one of a kind App 
len ratingfive It allows me to do many things 
len ratingfive I m very happy with this product 
len ratingthree I m sick of having to go into the app on all my devices to clear notifications for voicemails etc
len ratingfive How do I restart the app 
len ratingfour Great app 
len ratingfour Only one issue stops the th star 
len ratingfour An awesome feature of running seamless on multiple devices 
len ratingfour As I receive calls my laptop iPhone and iPad all ring 
len ratingfour Bad side iPhone ringer claims the entire screen 
len ratingfour So if I m listening to music or a pod cast I can t mute the phone and answer the preferred laptop I m working on please update this ring screen to the new iOS drop down notice 
len ratingthree  we need to include the audio in the app 
len ratingthree so we can play the video with sound 
len ratingthree Plz do update to the app as soon as possible
len ratingtwo Does not let you add participants to a meeting like the Teams app on my employer s phone 
len ratingtwo It s nothing more than a fancy calendar 
len ratingfive I use teams for my business as well as at home to school my kids 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingthree The app glitches out so much and it usually freezes it gets really annoying when I m in class sometimes I need to exit out of it hope you can fix it it happens a lot
len ratingone The amount of bugs in this app is crazy 
len ratingone Horrible for a whole township to use for every school virtually 
len ratingone  I love this app and all but it s just so slow and every device 
len ratingone I m a student using this for school and it s so slow even with mbps WiFi 
len ratingone It s so fustrating and the app is so laggy and takes for ever to do anything 
len ratingone I just hope they fix it especially since we are doing so many online classes with this 
len ratingone I don t like that app because you can mute your students
len ratingone I don t like it because my teacher muted me after saying funny stuff
len ratingone Leaked info it wasn t supposed to on a previous meeting 
len ratingone When contacted they just said to contact them if it happens again 
len ratingthree When using my work computer teams is a decent application but the settings and preferences are in different various locations unlocking the lobby managing your team sharing your screen 
len ratingthree Thanks for the new mute feature that keeps students muted until I am ready to take questions 
len ratingthree Please update for Macs so we may share sound audio during a presentation 
len ratingthree The feature looked like it was there and now is gone 
len ratingone Stop asking for a review
len ratingone I can t join a meeting when I do join it freezes and it s pixelated so fix
len ratingone  When ever I leave then go back I ll have to keep downloading it this is the worst app 
len ratingfour It could use a dark mode feature or dark theme and also idk if it s just me but my screen flickers some times when I use the app
len ratingthree So this app is not very good first of all I can not send or message any of my team mates and it s the is a glitchy app and I do like zoom better so yeah
len ratingthree Every time I try to do something while I m using the app it turns black for no reason 
len ratingthree  I like teams it s nice and easy to use but since mid September of this year I ve had problems of teams randomly but usually while in a meeting just lag out and crash 
len ratingthree And I have to restart the app and rejoin the meeting which is a pain sometimes 
len ratingthree Then I miss some instructions the teacher said when teams crashed 
len ratingthree Overall teams is nice to use but has some big performance issues 
len ratingthree I m not even in a meeting and it just crashes 
len ratingthree Please try to improve this 
len ratingthree The app on a pc is really slow and a resource hog
len ratingfive As a remote worker the teams app allows mobility and makes it possible to stay in touch with your team while your on the go 
len ratingfive And it s easy to use 
len ratingtwo Cris is a bad person I not very happy she my friends brother and I tried to add to make a yt vid and he remove me alot
len ratingfour Teams is a great tool for pulling our group together 
len ratingfour Improvement suggestions I would like to be able to see more colleagues at one time The connectivity is not perfect 
len ratingfour I find myself being kicked off the calls numerous times daily 
len ratingfive As an Apple developer I d like to say this is great for meetings like when we were discussing the new features for iPhone and iPhone and I just wanted to poke around and say thank you for making this app 
len ratingfive And we are currently discussing iPhone and iPad 
len ratingfive  Hehe
len ratingfive  For work remotely and meeting chat an collaboration 
len ratingthree I HATE IT BC WE HAVE SCHOOL IN THIS THING
len ratingthree On the one hand it connects me to work 
len ratingthree On the other hand it connects me to work so it s a mixed bag 
len ratingthree It seems to work fine 
len ratingthree I feel like it could work a little better but I don t have any constructive suggestions 
len ratingthree I think it s because it always opens to someone reacting to an old message and that s a minor quibble 
len ratingthree Otherwise the app is pretty solid 
len ratingthree It s nice to have access to Teams when I m mobile 
len ratingthree I have far more complaints about the desktop teams app 
len ratingone The update of Microsoft Teams is terrible because it is really bad in connection and you don t get privacy 
len ratingfour Would love option of custom ringtones 
len ratingfour Overall great app 
len ratingfour Still need some improvements 
len ratingfour Like it would be nice to be able to drag and drop a file from say outlook to teams 
len ratingfour There are minor improvements like this that could make this app awesome 
len ratingone I know you guys aren t the ones assigning the work but you the ones who made the app 
len ratingone  star you are the source of my DEPRESSION
len ratingone Screen sharing which used to work in Teams under iOS is broken under iOS 
len ratingone I now have to clamp a physical webcam to my iPad to share my screen 
len ratingfive Great mobile app 
len ratingfive Full featured and easy to use 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate for quick chats with team and organizing meeting notes 
len ratingfour There are a lot of functions and options 
len ratingfour However my biggest issue is that you cannot start a meeting from an iPad or iPhone 
len ratingfour This is SO frustrating and I hope in the next update this issue will be fixed 
len ratingone I have to say that I use a chrome book for schoolwork and if that doesn t work out I use my IPad 
len ratingone Today my chromebook s Microsoft crashed and the same thing happened on my tablet I feel like a bug put happened because I found out a lot of my classmates had the same problem 
len ratingone Due to this I haven t been able to attend class in two days 
len ratingone Please fix these bug outs 
len ratingone The app flashes a pop up asking if you like the app only if you say yes does it then flash the real pop up asking for App Store reviews 
len ratingone This is clearly gaming the system for good reviews 
len ratingfive Everything is pretty good 
len ratingfive The only thing that I would change is when a call comes in it should go to speaker not regular call because you can t hear anything right away and if you forget it can cause confusion 
len ratingfive Just easier to have it on speaker to begin with 
len ratingone I think we need a thumbs down so if the teachers are in the chat with a student they have to put a thumbs down 
len ratingthree It s good most of the time but sometimes it behave wired
len ratingone i absolutely hate teams 
len ratingone as a student using this i wouldn t recommend it to anyone 
len ratingone it s always glitching especially on my computer 
len ratingone it makes online learning so much more difficult 
len ratingone i wish i didn t have to use it EVER again 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Love the feature because I work in a global team 
len ratingone Many glitches and bugs and lags a lot 
len ratingone Don t know what to say more
len ratingthree Please add a feature when only your teacher can see your camera because not everyone is comfortable with it 
len ratingone  ios hnak mushkilat fi almusharakat fi alhalqat fi alnasi al iiftiradii tahdith altatbiq bima yatawafaq mae nizam iOS 
len ratingone This app is horrible I don t like this app so bad that it makes my phone act up
len ratingfive Teams offers security from outside joins 
len ratingfive It is a really good meeting app
len ratingfive It has been a life saver 
len ratingfive It is a very quick and easy way to communicate directly with anyone you choose to 
len ratingfive No look up or contact list 
len ratingfive I also like that you can see if they are responding immediately 
len ratingfive Very helpful during a hectic business day 
len ratingfour so my teams app says there are new notifications but i go to see what the notifications are and usually it would tell me and show me but it isn t doing that and it is starting to annoy me so could you guys have someone please fix this problem
len ratingfive I use this to communicate with my office staff and it s absolutely great 
len ratingfive Works just like the desktop version
len ratingthree The app works wonderfully the first time I downloaded it 
len ratingthree But when I log out of the app at the end of the day and log in the next day the app does not send me sound popup notifications anymore 
len ratingthree I have to delete the app and download it again in order for the notifications to work 
len ratingthree Could you please fix the issue 
len ratingfive Color me surprised that a business app for collaboration is as good as the full client 
len ratingfive Microsoft has upped the game these days 
len ratingfive This app is amazing
len ratingone Trash
len ratingfive What make this app great is how easy is to navigate it 
len ratingfive I work on it 
len ratingfive It s very good 
len ratingone After installing deleting and reinstalling MS Teams I still cannot get on with my iPad mini 
len ratingone It is stuck on the splash screen 
len ratingone I can t even type my credentials 
len ratingone please fix it
len ratingone Why in the world does Teams randomly unmute my microphone 
len ratingone I ve had this issue happen to me times already in the most unnecessary times 
len ratingthree I wish I could cancel notafacashins
len ratingone It signed me out on my computer and i cant in and thats were iget my school work from i scared ill never pass th grade microsoft plz let me back in plz
len ratingfive Couldn t have managed three months in lockdown without this app 
len ratingfive Have been a user from Lynx to Skype to Skype for Business and now Teams 
len ratingfive Collaboration is easier with this app 
len ratingfive So good fast no crashes no complaints
len ratingtwo Until recently it had been great experience with the app all worked very well 
len ratingtwo However with iOS there are now major issues if I mute myself I can t then unmute can t leave the meeting leave button doesn t do anything 
len ratingtwo Have to close the app completely to drop off the call 
len ratingtwo I am hoping the team behind this great tool will find a quick way to get back to greatness 
len ratingthree This is particularly the case when sharing screens and or video 
len ratingthree The screen sharing will offer 
len ratingthree Freeze up for recipients 
len ratingfour Let us delete chat messages 
len ratingone I can no longer join meetings with the latest version 
len ratingone Texts and calendar still work 
len ratingone It s so buggy and barely anything works 
len ratingone People are allowed to set due dates to yesterday and most people can t even get in a meeting 
len ratingone Much worse than google classroom 
len ratingfive It s also for Coronavirus Education
len ratingfive Really useful for my job
len ratingtwo iPhone S new battery 
len ratingtwo iOS Disabled background refresh and all other options yet Teams still used percent of my battery 
len ratingtwo It showed as background activity but I had it closed 
len ratingtwo Deleted the app because I was dead after hrs 
len ratingtwo App worked fine but it isn t worth it 
len ratingtwo  Every time I enter a call the screen stops working I can still see but there is no response from touch this persists threw my whole phone making it so if I join a call I have to shutdown my phone no longer works I noticed this issue after I had changed my screen as my old one was cracked I don t know if this is what caused the issue but for me this app is useless if it turns my phone into a potato
len ratingfour  There is something you need to fix 
len ratingfour The camera 
len ratingfour When ever I turn on my camera it doesn t do anything 
len ratingone Trying to join a vendors meeting 
len ratingone Multiple auth issues trying to join 
len ratingone End up missing half the meeting trying to get connected 
len ratingone What a disservice to your customers 
len ratingfive Very beneficial does not take up lot of space and even sets the reminders for you without y us having to do anything
len ratingone I use this for school 
len ratingone At the beginning of the semester it worked great every single meeting I was able to log on and join the meeting no problem 
len ratingone Then a few weeks later I started getting a weird bug where let me access the meeting but didn t give me the option to join it it just said click here to view meeting details 
len ratingone Now just recently it won t let me access the meeting at all 
len ratingone It just says the meeting is in progress and it won t even let me click on the meeting to join it 
len ratingone Lately I ve been having to watch the recordings of the meeting which is too bad because I would like to participate during the meeting 
len ratingone This is kind of counterintuitive as this is after all an app to meet as a group virtually 
len ratingone Now I can t even do that 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingthree I have been doing online school in teams it was the perfect quality 
len ratingthree But I don t like when teams meetings the teachers voice break up and glitches I have a few suggestions 
len ratingthree I would like you to fix the glitches and do some bug fixes and also I have a problem the assignments that I do whenever I do a decimal point 
len ratingthree It makes it wrong even though it s right 
len ratingthree Please do bug fixes to this 
len ratingtwo  When I join a meeting from my AirPod pros it says it connected but I get no audio 
len ratingtwo I have tried switching during the meeting and starting the meeting using the AirPods yes the volume was up nothing works 
len ratingtwo I have uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingtwo I know they work cause I can play any other audio through them 
len ratingtwo Ok if Microsoft teams didn t exist then I wouldn t have school that s kinda wack Microsoft you can do better than that 
len ratingtwo But seriously tho hey Microsoft can you make it so teachers can t give assignments on the day that they scheduled the assignment 
len ratingtwo Bc I would always have assignments due on days that they scheduled it and I just wanted to relax but NO 
len ratingtwo I hope people hack Microsoft so I don t have school 
len ratingone Slow and horrible
len ratingthree Sometimes when I join a meeting for class it unmutes me for no reason when i join 
len ratingtwo It s great for messaging with my work team 
len ratingtwo Group calls have gotten better but I would like to be able to participate with my team with the fun backgrounds 
len ratingtwo I don t have a camera for my computer so blur it is even though everyone else gets to use personalized backgrounds 
len ratingtwo Please get with this feature Microsoft 
len ratingfive I love this app but I cannot get into the meeting If I am not in the meeting with my computer on my phone I hope that you can fix that issue but over all love the app
len ratingfour I have a problem every time I join a meeting it will take so long to except me in the meeting even though my teachers say they have already excepted me in the meeting but it s won t let me in and sometimes it will lag and kick me out of Teams and when I join it won t let me see the screen every time my teachers share their screen and sometimes it won t let me open the camera or the microphone I need help please answer thank you 
len ratingone Terrible absolutely terrible I don t recommend it at all not even recommend it Microsoft you have to find a solution for this situation it takes me about an hour to get into my online class and by the time I m in the class it s already over teachers always think I m absent so your e not just making my life harder you re also making me lose grades I really don t how this app has a rating it deserves a rating 
len ratingone Fix your app please and thank you
len ratingone Dose not work good for school non stop messing up allow chrome Books to be compatible
len ratingfive I use this for school and it is wonderful and I recommend using this app 
len ratingfive It is better than zoom because you can have all school work and have meeting all on one app 
len ratingone I hate school
len ratingone I have never been able to use this app on my iPhone X because it crashes when opened 
len ratingone Typical Microsoft software 
len ratingfive On planet earth
len ratingtwo Please reenable phone controls mute keypad etc on the Lock Screen while in a meeting 
len ratingtwo After updating to iOS and locking my phone while in a video call all I see is a blank screen 
len ratingtwo Not practical to stream video that I can t pay attention to while driving just to mute unmute myself 
len ratingtwo Killing my data usage 
len ratingtwo Sometimes on incoming phone calls outside of Teams I don t receive an answer decline option from the person that is calling 
len ratingtwo Instead I receive an alert to answer a call from a meeting I was in earlier 
len ratingtwo I equate MS Teams to a batch of cookies that needs to be put back in the over for another half hour 
len ratingtwo The framework and feature set is there but there is zero polish or attention to detail in usability 
len ratingtwo Basic features are missing or broken and would quickly be found out with even a little more testing from the MS devs 
len ratingtwo Hopefully they continue to develop this app and can catch up to Slack one day 
len ratingthree There should be an margin of say minutes before stays changes to away when phone screen is off 
len ratingthree Just like Skype did 
len ratingone If you are using an iPad or anything not official Micro oft it is near useless 
len ratingone Constant freeze 
len ratingone Does not quit previous session 
len ratingone Has no thoughtful features 
len ratingone Avoid this tool 
len ratingone I HATE THIS 
len ratingone The drawing tools always glitch when ever I try to draw 
len ratingone Don t even get me started with class note book 
len ratingone I have one word for this app 
len ratingone HORRIBLE
len ratingfive During these times having a platform to communicate ideas and facilitate meetings is something that keeps my team safe while letting us do what we do best 
len ratingfive  Microsoft keep at it 
len ratingtwo I m using this app but the new features are horrible 
len ratingtwo I have to wait to get in a a meeting 
len ratingtwo Please delete this feature 
len ratingtwo It s horrible 
len ratingtwo And the fact that you cant call teachers Is horrible That s why i gave it two stars 
len ratingfour Ok so we all know the global pandemic has bringed us to do everything at home 
len ratingfour I am a student that uses this app DAILY and i really like it but recently they did this new update that changed everything but not a lot because you could still understand everything that u have to do in the app so over all i liked the update 
len ratingfour BUT there is this section on Microsoft Teams called assignments keep in mind that i have been using this app for YEARS with no problem at all this section let you see all your assignments that you have to do and they re due dates how much they re worth etc 
len ratingfour And this section was divided by every class teams group etc 
len ratingfour For example if you went to assignments it would appear a list of all of ur classes groups teams etc 
len ratingfour And you have to click the class that you would like to see the assignments 
len ratingfour I really liked how they were divided BUT now in the new update all of the assignments are put together and i REALLY DONT LIKE THAT because i like to keep everything very organized and i dont like that the assignments are all mixed together 
len ratingfour Overall i like this app a lot and its very easy to use is just the little things that bother me a tiny bit 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft 
len ratingfour Marker 
len ratingtwo Litterally doesn t give you privacy 
len ratingfour Currently unable to share screen and see participants or chat at the same time 
len ratingone I can t make a call 
len ratingone Basically y all took it away
len ratingfive Teams is a very user friendly app 
len ratingfive I can keep in touch with my co workers anytime I need to 
len ratingone Almost everytime I go to mute myself or turn of my camera it doesn t work this app is garbage compared to literally any other for group video calls 
len ratingone I was watching some guy scream the lyrics to how bad can I be from the Lorax and my entire class heard it PEOPLE HEARD IT 
len ratingone Fix this issue ASAP so no other poor students have to suffer 
len ratingthree Don t know why my private chat with the teachers has been disable 
len ratingthree Need help on that action
len ratingtwo When i go to do my work for school it will keep on freezing and i will have to keep on Restarting it
len ratingtwo Every time my daughter tries to get on Microsoft Teams for her school her app just totally freezes up and nothing can be pressed it s been two days now and I don t know what to do 
len ratingtwo I ve deleted and redownlowded the app several times and it doesn t help at all 
len ratingtwo What can be done about this 
len ratingfive Nice to have on my phone 
len ratingfive Works very well
len ratingone  Trash
len ratingone It acts slow and it lags 
len ratingone And it s dumb and stupid 
len ratingfive I use this app everyday for work 
len ratingfive It s a great application for business 
len ratingfive I love in app calls text or messages 
len ratingfive It s the only choice in my opinion for any Team oriented group
len ratingfour It s a great work messaging app i just wish it would work with Siri Shortcuts 
len ratingtwo There s an update and now nothing is organized 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work
len ratingthree For my club I need to have two devices with TEAMs on it but every time I download it on my iPad it freezes up and I can t do anything 
len ratingthree I ve tried restarting it and deleting and reinstalling the app but it rarely works 
len ratingthree But when it does it s really good so that s what the stars are for 
len ratingfive One of the easiest collaborative apps I have used in a long time as a team lead and team member 
len ratingfive Excellent app
len ratingone We have to go to school
len ratingone  Hi I ve been using the app with my students amp l ve been encountering some issues 
len ratingone  When I share my screen amp play videos ss can t hear the sound 
len ratingone  I couldn t stop or leave the chat during or after the lesson it s been so annoying 
len ratingone  I want to stop the calls also 
len ratingfive I wish LAUSD would you use this instead of using Zoom which is an unsecured platform 
len ratingfive I ve only had a minor difficulties with Microsoft teams as compared to zoom which always has some form of difficulty every single day 
len ratingtwo I m trying to type but its not letting me fix it please
len ratingfour When I ve been able to get the MS Teams platform to work its excellent 
len ratingfour I have sometimes experienced problems connecting to meetings using the link sent in email by the meeting organizer with the connection to the meeting failing 
len ratingfour Likewise chat message replies to other participants failed without an apparent reason for the failed connection or failed chats 
len ratingfour The interface once connected though is good 
len ratingone Es de nerds y nunca lo instalen voten una estrella y desinst lalo seria lo mejor 
len ratingone  Wont let me sign in
len ratingfour This app is okay with me and I recommend this app
len ratingfour It really works well other than the fact that it keeps crashing at random time 
len ratingfour the whole app just slows down and then freezes and its usually in the middle of a meeting so you have to leave miss content and reload the app only for it to do it again minutes later 
len ratingfive Can we ha e two windows of teams at the same one for chat another one for viewing documents
len ratingtwo Very Laggy I m seeing button text and tbh it s annoying me 
len ratingtwo  No offense 
len ratingone I have problems with this app I can t turn on the speaker and camera
len ratingthree I wish there could be a basic option incorporated to disable last seen on the teams app 
len ratingthree Other than that the app is very handy to connect to your peers 
len ratingtwo I only have a few issues with it will lag and kick me out of my meetings with my Teachers 
len ratingtwo And I will sometimes be in a class that the teacher has to click a little check mark to say like aye this person is a th grader in my class I recognise that name I will let them in but if you get kicked out in the middle of the meeting and the teacher has to let you back in you may miss important details and be counted absent tardy 
len ratingtwo Also THE DEMON CHILDREN IM MY CLASS somehow will give themselves permissions and remove mute and lower people s hands like why can teachers have the option TO GIVE AN YEAR OLD PERMISSIONS AND NOT EXPECT CHAOS 
len ratingtwo I rest my case 
len ratingone Logs me out all the time
len ratingfour The app functionality works well enough 
len ratingfour One thing I d ask is the ability to allow for custom tones for notifications rather than all the default tones 
len ratingone The Microsoft teams app has not been working on my iPad since early September 
len ratingone It just freezes and it won t let me join my classes 
len ratingone I don t know why the Teams app is not working on my iOS devices but they need to fix it 
len ratingone I am a student here and I just want to tell you that I learn NOTHING 
len ratingone I hate it here I just want the mic to mute when I press it 
len ratingone But NO 
len ratingone I have to have the whole class listen to me singing Schuyler Sisters without me knowing 
len ratingone Well rate the app write a review then leave 
len ratingone Peace out 
len ratingfive I love this I use it for my school
len ratingthree Pinning a video screen stopped working after updated to iOS 
len ratingthree I checked with an iPhone and iPad and it doesn t work on both 
len ratingthree Still works on another iPhone with iOS 
len ratingfour It s a great app because you can have meetings talk to your teachers or co workers and even during Covid you still have a job or school so I really do love this app exept 
len ratingfour I HATE that the creators of this app got rid of the chat 
len ratingfour Other than that I loves Microsoft Teams 
len ratingone It tells the teacher you have the camera off and my parents don t let me watch anime TwT
len ratingone La app me esta dando depresi n y no puedo mas con esto considero q es abuso infantil quitar app lo mas r pido posible gracias lt 
len ratingfive This app is really easy to use 
len ratingfive Specially if you use discord because this app is similar to discord 
len ratingfive TEAMS IS GREAT 
len ratingone  LOS MAESTROS JODEN DEMASIAU
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfour When my computer died and I started working from my iPad I was worried I would loose a lot of my functionality in Teams as my organization works almost exclusively in Teams 
len ratingfour I ve been pleased to find that for the most part the app offers the same functionality and even has a couple advantages 
len ratingfour In a multi person call the app will automatically shift from a multi view to a main speaker talks more than seconds without interruption and back as needed 
len ratingfour The down sides are mainly small such as you can t have chat open and see the video feeds of others in the meeting at the same time 
len ratingfour The only major piece of functionality that is missing is the ability to start a video call in a channel or a chat with yourself which we use to record and share presentations 
len ratingfour Developers Please add this function to the app and you ll have a star rating from me 
len ratingtwo Microsoft teams does not let me use my AirPod pros on my iPhone or on my computer 
len ratingfive So as many people were are doing online school so my th grade teacher she decided to use teams for the class ty for adding the ya d button for IOS now I could raise my hand 
len ratingfive Can you put the calling sign up and the text won I wanna call my friends NOW
len ratingfive My entire office used this and it s a great collaboration tool as well as organizational tool for conversations projects being worked on 
len ratingfive It allows us to keep all corresponding chats comments immediate issues all in place 
len ratingfive It also allows us to function properly as our office is on a rotating schedule with only of us in the office at a time 
len ratingfive With Teams we don t miss a beat 
len ratingone I ve been trying to enter my classes with this thing but it keeps crashing and no the problem isn t from my device it s the app needs MAJOR update
len ratingone Simplemente la odio 
len ratingthree They have no chat place left and that is really annoying 
len ratingthree When I have to text my teacher something I do it in chat but now I can t 
len ratingthree If they took the chat place away because people where getting bullied or something they should have just token the chat away from them not everyone 
len ratingone I always turn my camera on in my classes because is mandatory but it appears to my teachers that is off
len ratingone This is a really watered down version of the Teams I know and love 
len ratingone It is difficult to navigate start instant meetings and many other frustrating elements 
len ratingone Another example is when sharing a screen broadcast as it is called here the app crashes in the middle of a call please please avoid using this app on iOS and stick to Windows 
len ratingone Just terrible and frustrating 
len ratingone Why is this platform so broken also why did you mix all of the assignments together it was easier to look at them by clases you just ruined the app and made it more stressful
len ratingone First i was supposed to send a homework to my teacher but then i discovered that they removed the chat and the teacher already mentioned that if the assignment section dosent work you can send in the chat but now what i cant call or chat and the teachers wont get my assignments 
len ratingone I hope you can fix that problem thank you
len ratingfive Los fondos de pantalla en el chat no salen 
len ratingfive Necesito ayuda 
len ratingfive Gracias
len ratingthree any time I ever try to view my shifts team shifts the app insists I need to download Staff Hub which no longer exists to view them and I m out of luck unless I re download and even then it s a toss up if it ll work or not Fix this bug and the stars will be 
len ratingfour Microsoft teams is easy to use and it s helpful but can you just add homescreen widgets that show you the calendar 
len ratingfive I not only use this app for my job I also use this app for my own personal career ventures 
len ratingfive It s even good for family and friends 
len ratingfive Just so everyone stays on the same page 
len ratingfive I use other workflow apps as well but all together added up doesn t come close to the usage of Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive Great job guys 
len ratingfive I love this app and the trailblazing it has provided for the COVID times we re dealing with 
len ratingfive I honestly would believe in real homeschooling if I had real settings for all activity going on the platform 
len ratingfive Maybe a passcode with the login that shows deleted data etc 
len ratingfour Team is a very good app when it works as supposed to be 
len ratingfour It put heavy loading of network so folks in India or Egypt will have problems in conf calls with audio and sharing screen at the same time 
len ratingfour At time some users will have severe echoes during the call even in US and Canada 
len ratingfour Hence stars only 
len ratingone I am so mad now 
len ratingone YOU LITERALLY JUST GOT RID OF CHATTING WITH PEOPLE AND CALLING THEM 
len ratingone NOW I HAVE NO WAY OF CALLING MY FRIENDS OR CHATTING WITH THEM EXCEPT FOR ROBLOX AND ITSLEARNING 
len ratingone  ROBLOX AND ITSLEARNING DONT HAVE CALLING PEOPLE ON THEM 
len ratingone PLEASE JUST PUT BACK THE CHAT AND CALLS OR I M KEEPING ONE STAR ON THIS APP 
len ratingone I was in class and it was telling me my mic was muted while I was presenting
len ratingtwo the chat tab was removed and we need it back 
len ratingtwo I m having issues with teams it used to work just fine before now I can t click on anything and it just freezes on me all the time now
len ratingfive Since quarantined I ve been all over the place and me using teams is such a great way to connect to my teachers friends I love it so much but it works awful it s like freezes up in a call with my teachers
len ratingone  I m not able to join the meeting as a guest 
len ratingfive It has been a great app application to use for multitasking and multidimensional work and comm 
len ratingfive There are some aspects that could use some slight tweaks by enlarge great job for a change Microsoft 
len ratingfive I wish the MS Teams Application was accessible to laptops and desktops instead of just tablets and mobile phones 
len ratingfive This is a great application but I limited because of the accessibility issues 
len ratingone I have to use this for school 
len ratingone Currently the join button for you know joining the freaking call is not showing up on my laptop pc or iPhone 
len ratingone It s so glitchy there s only a few name icons people visible on the screen at a time when you try to look at the probably at least other people in the meeting they re literally in an unclickable button icon at the bottom left of the screen that ll say something like 
len ratingone It s not even more secure than zoom my schools teams got hacked and kids got into meetings and started screaming profanities 
len ratingone If teams decides to stop working you just have to live with it 
len ratingone It s so poorly designed and it hasn t improved like at all since the beginning of COVID 
len ratingone You would think Microsoft would clean this dumpster fire up but no they went ahead and just rearranged office again 
len ratingone My internet was pretty good in the morning and everything else was loading in and all but Microsoft teams kept getting frozen and not loading in for me 
len ratingone I reseted the app more than enough times but it still doesn t work 
len ratingone When it FINALLY loaded in it already took about or so minutes and I missed my attendance 
len ratingone Thanks a lot 
len ratingthree When using the mobile app teams constantly blacks out the whole screen so that you can not use it 
len ratingthree Even if you have meetings running in the background 
len ratingthree Other than that this app is pretty great
len ratingone Impossible to use it as it crashes immediately upon opening 
len ratingtwo My version of team freezes when I try to undertake some functions in the latest iOS 
len ratingtwo For example when I screen share and try to do other things it freezes when I switch back it shows the startup screen with the teams logo and white background 
len ratingtwo So this is necessary to fix ASAP
len ratingtwo The features are very interesting and have a great amount of features 
len ratingtwo It would be awesome if there was more drag and drop features between groups and chats 
len ratingtwo A lot of times you have to save a hard copy just to upload it again 
len ratingtwo It could be an amazing cloud based service but seems to be awkwardly riding a line between old and new school 
len ratingtwo Very excited to see the evolution 
len ratingfour That needs to be fixed ASAP 
len ratingone Idk
len ratingfive Yay
len ratingfive Super simple and keeps you connected all the time 
len ratingone  While there are many promising aspects in Teams the number of bugs and usage uses are almost inexcusable 
len ratingone For example downloading files times out when downloading more than one large video at a time even on a connect getting mbs down and up 
len ratingone App frequently starts in offline mode and cannot be started until reinstalled 
len ratingone Not a very handy feature 
len ratingone Cannot logon and pop error vanishes so quickly it is barely readable even though every other app works properly 
len ratingone Half baked 
len ratingthree When I am minding my business in another tab while I am in a meeting my mic will come unmuted and I get a notification saying that my teacher has muted me 
len ratingthree I never unmuted myself in the first place 
len ratingthree This is a big problem I should not have to be checking every seconds to see if my mic is muted while I am doing other things 
len ratingfive So good
len ratingtwo Really slow sometimes and it is slow at the worst times
len ratingone Takes forever to load and is a waste of time zoom is way better and echos and it s terrible if your using the website instead of the app and sometimes you cant even blur ur background 
len ratingone This is the worst app ever
len ratingfive Teams has been a great tool for remote working 
len ratingfive We use chat calls screen share and video 
len ratingfive It s so simple to switch between them 
len ratingone Not letting me into meetings it just gets stuck on initializing plz fix
len ratingtwo No se puede quitar foto de perfil de Teams 
len ratingtwo  I m using this app but the new features are horrible 
len ratingtwo I have to wait to get in a a meeting 
len ratingtwo Please delete this feature 
len ratingtwo It s horrible 
len ratingtwo That s why i gave it two stars 
len ratingthree It would be helpful the receive a notice that is la ding or show up on the screen rather than a small red dot when a message received
len ratingfive I used Skype prior to Teams 
len ratingfive I ve been on Teams for less than weeks and I find it superior in many ways already 
len ratingfour The app works well 
len ratingfour However the latest update that changed the way shifts looks works made it impossible to see who else is assigned on a given day 
len ratingfour It worked before but now it always shows screen that says no people working this day 
len ratingfour Hopefully they work it out and get it functioning the way it did 
len ratingfour Edit I found a way to make it work 
len ratingfive This is really great app for conference call 
len ratingfive Easy to connect very stable and nice looking UI
len ratingtwo I have notifications turned off for teams but I periodically check the app 
len ratingtwo Someone had called me I missed the call which is fine because I turned off notifications 
len ratingtwo However while if you tap on activity it will show you the missed call there is nothing on the activity Icon that shows you should tap on it to see that you missed something 
len ratingtwo It would be a nice improvement to see something on activity to show you that you missed something like the desktop app does 
len ratingfive I love teams teams it the best
len ratingfive Christian bale as Batman vs george Clooney
len ratingfive Omg 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Pls stop the hate
len ratingthree I have teams for work on my personal phone 
len ratingthree With callkit integration there is too many mixing of business and personal 
len ratingthree I absolutely do NOT want to see anything work related unless I am actively using those apps 
len ratingthree I also don t want my personal phone ringing for a work related call 
len ratingthree Please add an option to disable callkit phone mobile integration 
len ratingfive I would recommend 
len ratingfive Like zoom but more stuff 
len ratingone i dont like school
len ratingthree While the latest version allows you to call or join meetings it ll ultimately shut itself bc you need to update the microphone settings 
len ratingthree But when you go to your phone settings to enable the microphone for Teams it s not there 
len ratingthree The desktop version is levels above the mobile app version 
len ratingone  Microsoft Teams is the worst computer software platform I used because it keeps crashing all the time my camera stops working all the time and everything stops working all the time 
len ratingone I don t have to keep restarting my computer every time it keeps crashing 
len ratingone Please fix it NOW 
len ratingone Microsoft teams is down all the time and it makes me miss my online class 
len ratingone I don t recommend this
len ratingfive Teams has become my go to for everything 
len ratingfour I like it 
len ratingfour Is great video quality and audio 
len ratingfour Great to have the bar removed from the middle and number of people on screen 
len ratingfour But it still have to evolve for the IM functionality and interactive engagement with white board etc 
len ratingfour Adding assignment for free users is necessary please try to add thank you
len ratingtwo I d like a timer setting for availability and away options
len ratingone  On ipad it used to be good until people started going back to school it became heavy and even a iPad Pro was slow when using teams and the fact that this is high rated Microsoft app I expected better 
len ratingone Teams was a huge improvement to our organization but the app has issues with logging in 
len ratingone Outlook and our authentication apps can simply use my face to login for work 
len ratingone However teams requires my username password and then to authenticate with our app that then uses my face for verification while on the same phone 
len ratingone This makes using Teams extremely frustrating and so I ve uninstalled 
len ratingone No app should make it cumbersome to respond to a simple text message 
len ratingone Takes me longer to login than it does to respond to someone which makes the app pointless 
len ratingone Los maestro joden demasiau
len ratingfive So fast and easy to stay connected with my team 
len ratingone  The quality is terrible all the people on the call don t sound clear at all
len ratingone Stupid app
len ratingone This is making me so angry it s glitchy and won t lemme join this was the case for the last weeks due to that I ve been absent and school started deducting marks 
len ratingone But thank goodness my dad talked to the school and they returned my grades But right now I can t join this is getting on my nerves It feels like the app wants you to be angry 
len ratingfour It s an excellent app letting me do my work and communicate but I can t see the invite for my classes which is very important for me because school will determine whether I pass or I fail Microsoft if you can fix this bug it would be a even better experience and it will help me graduate other than that it s a great app but I can t see my classes 
len ratingone Please for the love of all things holy tell me how to join a video team meeting 
len ratingone I don t want outlook it s crappy 
len ratingone Everything online says to click on the email link or in outlook 
len ratingone Shouldn t one be able to access a wannabe Zoom meeting in the app 
len ratingone And yes I wish my committee would use the far superior Zoom video chat 
len ratingfive We went virtual over the last quarter of school and teams was awesome 
len ratingfive It gave me notifications and the calendar was an awesome tool 
len ratingfive I like how if you forget about a class it gives you a notification that tells you the class has started 
len ratingfive And how the messages work like well normal text messages 
len ratingfive I also like how you can message your teachers about class work or anything 
len ratingfive Maybe even just a thank you and how you can message class mates but not strangers from other schools 
len ratingfive I have never had a single lag 
len ratingfive Oh and I like the new feature of being able to see more than four people on your screen 
len ratingfive This works great as a collaboration app an app for virtual meetings even school 
len ratingfive I am trying so hard to think of any criticism or something back right now I am searching every inch of my brain 
len ratingfive It s like when you ask Siri and she doesn t give you an answer 
len ratingfive Well since there s nothing bad to say thank you for reading my constructive criticism comment 
len ratingfive  Liv
len ratingfive Easy and convenient to use 
len ratingfive This has become a vital part of our communication with colleagues and team members 
len ratingfour Hi i dont have teams icon on panel and i cant join a meeting 
len ratingfour The app is good but a main thing missing in the app but in the desktop is the whiteboard feature for meetings 
len ratingfour Please add that function 
len ratingfour It s awesome in the desktop version 
len ratingfour Even so still a great product and really helps our teams come together during the pandemic 
len ratingone I keep getting messages from a woman named Bently to vote on a movie for class 
len ratingone  Horrible app 
len ratingfour  The crater need to put background on iPad and phone and 
len ratingfour Teams is good for meeting but it s annoying like people keep sending massages like they are doing like those pictures and funny stuffs crater can u do please wait sec to chat 
len ratingfour Becuse people are keep doing that are not we are doing in class 
len ratingfour And Teams is good 
len ratingfour And great sorry if I am being mean or salty 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingthree I would like a way to capture a screen shot included in teams without having to use a third party like snippet
len ratingone My friend is not getting any notifications from the app 
len ratingone She s missing classes because of it 
len ratingone She s tried contacting teams support but no result 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone This isn t what the schools should be using this app don t even work right
len ratingfour It took a pandemic to finally make Teams a usable product 
len ratingfour I suffered through Lynx Skype for Business and earlier dysfunctional versions of Teams 
len ratingfour Winston Churchill presciently described Teams when he said paraphrasing You can trust MS to makes Teams great after they have tried every other approach 
len ratingfour It does work well now and am happy to use it 
len ratingfour I still have trouble connecting outsiders and don t want to be tech support 
len ratingfour Teams works better for small groups and the virtual backgrounds are better 
len ratingfour Zoom is still better with large diverse groups running multiple platforms 
len ratingfive Love teams
len ratingfive I love the voice option in chat cause I can just leave a voice mail thing for VAs saves 
len ratingfive E writing time
len ratingone  It makes me sign in all the freaking time
len ratingfour  The update that I downloaded it for teams it shows me the options that are down and ya it s a good thing but there is another thing it shows me on the right hand the profile picture of the person who is talking it covers the content that is being shared share screen so I can t see everything 
len ratingfour If you guys just lower down the profile thing on the right hand 
len ratingfour Please please please it would be easier 
len ratingfour But everything is great in the app except this thing 
len ratingone How do I stop MS Teams availability icon changing automatically on my profile photo 
len ratingone I work on two separate computers next to each other 
len ratingone Both are used for two separate companies 
len ratingone They both use MS Teams as their communication app 
len ratingone When I work on one computer for more then minutes the other computer shows that I am away not available from MS Teams 
len ratingone I need to be available to ask any question on both computers 
len ratingone I have looked in the MS Teams settings and there is no way to adjust this or change the timeout from a few minutes to a few hours like you can do in Skype for Business 
len ratingone Thanks
len ratingone This app is poop why do you make teachers in this 
len ratingtwo Every time a new message comes in the badge number goes up by one even after they have been cleared 
len ratingtwo It is bringing back all of the notifications that have been cleared each time a new one comes in 
len ratingone It s is so boring
len ratingtwo Very difficult not easy to use
len ratingfour I love this app except one bug 
len ratingfour I live in the east coast and it does not take daylight saving time into account 
len ratingfour For example when I create am meeting it becomes at am automatically 
len ratingfour Therefore I always need to use outlook for scheduling 
len ratingfour Hope this bug could be fixed soon 
len ratingone i was doing my homework just fine when out of nowhere it told me that there was in issue with the whole homework tab and i couldn t access my homework no matter how many times i clicked try again it didn t do anything then i restarted it and it just kicked me out of my account and wouldn t let me back in and it wasn t just in teams that it kicked me out of it was all of my microsoft applications and it told me that there was a problem singing in so i tried to sign in manually and it tu old me my account didn t exist even tho it was the same address i have been using since before quarantine and it wouldn t let me back in to my account then it just randomly started working again MICROSOFT IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY AND ITS LAGGY AND CRAPPY DO NOT RECOMMEND USE GOOGLE CLASSROOMS INSTEAD ITS WAY BETTER
len ratingone This was a great app 
len ratingone Then something changed 
len ratingone I can t get to the assignments in the app from my phone anymore 
len ratingone Too bad we have to have this app for school 
len ratingone I will probably fail now 
len ratingone Thanks guys 
len ratingone Not like they give us anytime to fix this I have assignments due today that I can t get to 
len ratingone Well there goes my GPA 
len ratingone  Hey texkidd this sounds like you signed in to Teams on your phone using your personal Microsoft account instead of your school account 
len ratingone You can fix this by adding your school account from the menu by selecting Add account 
len ratingone Alternatively you c
len ratingone  Very bad 
len ratingone Don t need this app 
len ratingone It s useless and makes me have assignmen in one day 
len ratingone Pls get rid of it
len ratingfive  has been a weird year 
len ratingfive Microsoft actually develops an app that works 
len ratingfive This is million times better than Skype for Business 
len ratingthree I would like to know how I can delete old conversations from people who are no longer team members 
len ratingthree Also I cannot seen to receive important announcements even thought I have it tagged as message me with new Information this is NOT AT ALL what was said 
len ratingthree But I was not able to receive new of my CEOs passing because it was posted under important announcements even though I had the bell tagged 
len ratingthree I would like an explanation for this if it s possible 
len ratingthree That s all 
len ratingthree Goodnight good paws and good luck 
len ratingone I use this app for work quite often 
len ratingone Changed my passwords today per company policy and now I can t log back in at all 
len ratingone I get to the login page and it just a blank white screen 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingfour wish we can change meeting background
len ratingfive Teams has improved the effectiveness of my team immeasurably 
len ratingfive TEAMS keeps everyone in the loop
len ratingtwo It won t let me make video calls 
len ratingtwo Missed classes bc of that 
len ratingtwo I thought having the app would be a good alternative to not having my laptop but nope 
len ratingtwo App doesn t work 
len ratingfour Not yet a five 
len ratingfour They mobile version on iOS does not allow for changing tone on notifications 
len ratingfour The existing tone is weak so it is easy to miss notifications 
len ratingthree Whenever it pops up which seems every other swipe it bugs the hell out of the Assignment module 
len ratingthree So if the kid is taking and exam and god forbid he swipes and triggers the TSweb thing the screen goes white and we have to go back to Teams tab Class and relaunch assignment exam form there 
len ratingthree Also the Join button to join a meeting in calendar is right below the Share button and too often the user triggers the share instead of joining 
len ratingthree And get rid of the notification rows at the top of the screen when in a meeting 
len ratingthree Nearly Impossible to dismiss 
len ratingfive  Great app tho
len ratingfive  Buena aplicaci n para aprender cosas nuevas 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive I am so glad my company is using as it has saved us a great deal of stress during the COVID shutdowns 
len ratingfive It truly is a lifesaver I hope we can keep it 
len ratingone Please fix this bug
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingthree I would like to pin my chats so frequently used people are at the top 
len ratingthree This is how i do in on my computer and it would be nice if it matched 
len ratingone Since my OS upgrade can t log in as guest 
len ratingone Thanks for allowing me to miss an important meeting
len ratingfour I d like to be able to attach graphics currently I cannot 
len ratingone  Lately MS Teams has been busy out a lot of new updates features 
len ratingone When doing so they forget to implement changes across all platforms e g 
len ratingone iOS and Windows 
len ratingone The latest issue is MS Teams Calling and adding additional participants to a call 
len ratingone Previously when calling a landline you had the add participant icon at the top right and could then add a rd caller but now it is missing 
len ratingone When using it in Windows the add participant navigation has been moved to the floating menu
len ratingfour This app is really great for school use and work 
len ratingfour One thing that would make it better would being able to talk with each other in the lobby like a class lobby where you can talk to your peers while waiting for the organizer to admit you
len ratingone Everything needs an improvement 
len ratingtwo Please add an option to turn off the buttons so they aren t using screen space 
len ratingtwo The latest update makes them always on screen which reduces the visible area and there is no way to hide them and use the whole screen like the previous version 
len ratingfour Generally pretty good but chat needs inline response function and in video you should be able to move the camera from bottom right of screen like in Skype 
len ratingfour Also there should be a last number redial for group calls instead of inputting fresh every day 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo This app was for my school every time i go to a school meeting i get kicked and it is not my internet i would really love it if teams would just update the app and make the glitches go away 
len ratingone Genz give it a so it can get banned from apple App Stores no cap
len ratingfive  It s really ear good because you can communicate with your teacher and your friends
len ratingthree No pop ups to members when message was updated
len ratingfive So teams is a flawless app truly truly 
len ratingfive But as I said an app can t be an app with its flaws 
len ratingfive So Teams is a great app but I have problems 
len ratingfive  I m on tablet so sometimes when my class is starting I cannot get in this problem is not because of the internet nor teachers specials students etc And I have been delayed by teams many times and I m not proud of that 
len ratingfive  The Raise Hand feature it s really helpful for teachers and what not but it seems that when I raise my hand it doesn t SHOW that I m raising my hand in the organizer s screen 
len ratingfive Other than those two ONLYY problems Teams is an amazing app for communication and sharing 
len ratingfive From your fellow teamer Xx sieGTheCutiexX 
len ratingthree  Honestly it s really bad always lagging I don t recommend it
len ratingone Honestly I m surprised I gave this app one star 
len ratingone It glitches and every time I join my class meeting it glitches me out of the app 
len ratingone It takes things off my calendar and keeps deleting itself
len ratingthree There is no authority for organizers I want give silent for students I can t why it s easy please Add this important feature to the organizer
len ratingfour I like it but wish I could delete conversations as well 
len ratingfive I want the update
len ratingfive Wonderful app for remote workers who have team members spread out 
len ratingfive Gives me and my coworkers the ability to work from anywhere in the world 
len ratingtwo Que la app tuviera un bot n para reportar a los maestros si hacen o dicen cosas q no deben hacer 
len ratingfive Very good for collaboration and document sharing 
len ratingfour My administrator took away the chat so can you plz take that away 
len ratingone I HATE IT FOR SCHOOL other then that it s excellent
len ratingfive I love the app and application 
len ratingfive It s a great tool to get business done 
len ratingfive This is amazing because you can chat with friends 
len ratingfive It is also good for school
len ratingfour Good job 
len ratingfour Sharing screen on desktop while talking on the phone is not possible 
len ratingfour Or transfer from desktop to mobile is not possible 
len ratingfour But overall is good 
len ratingone I am not a user of Teams app and didn t even have the app installed till today 
len ratingone The reason I had to install the app is just to find out how to remove my name from the team group I didn t accept invite and still get multiple notifications a day on my personal email from the group 
len ratingone Can t we have a basic authentication out of band e g to ensure that my personal email is not misused by some random person using it on Teams 
len ratingone I looked into the invite and have to send a email to a email in that invite to remove me 
len ratingone How do i get myself unsubscribed from what I didn t subscribe to begin with 
len ratingone Does it mean anyone can use someone else email address to register 
len ratingfive I do school on this app lol
len ratingone Let us change our away setting 
len ratingone Every time I try to use this app on my iPhone it doesn t let me login 
len ratingone I have to delete the app then reinstall it 
len ratingone Every time 
len ratingone why does it literally freeze ever two seconds i don t understand
len ratingone Im not blaming it on the app its just my teachers give us to much work 
len ratingfour Would be great to have hide swipe on mobile chats
len ratingthree  Please reenable phone controls mute keypad etc on the Lock Screen while in a call 
len ratingthree After updating to iOS and locking my phone while in a video call all I see is a blank screen 
len ratingthree Not practical to stream video that I can t pay attention to while driving just to mute unmute myself 
len ratingthree Killing my data usage 
len ratingthree Good app otherwise I m not missing Skype at all 
len ratingfour I wish the chat function had a better alert pop up so you can easily see when someone is messaging you this was a good function in Skype
len ratingfive Much more user friendly than Webex 
len ratingtwo  The app is fine but the biggest low hanging fruit is that you cannot match the system s appearance light dark 
len ratingtwo This is a no brainer
len ratingone  I have to wake up at just because of this stupid app 
len ratingone I hate it so much 
len ratingone You guys need to add a feature we re I can disable notification I m in class trying to sleep and all I hear is ding ding ding when I disabled notifis I m trying to sleep in peace but I can t because of all these ding ding dongs and now I have a headache please fix this it gives me Severe headaches but what s good is that I can mute my teacher 
len ratingfive This is a great app to bring people ideas and materials together to form a total communications package from anywhere 
len ratingfive I highly recommend 
len ratingfive  Mark F 
len ratingfive  Communications collaboration document sharing and app integration all at the fingertips 
len ratingfive In many ways this is ahead of the desktop version especially with multi tenant access 
len ratingone This app needs work 
len ratingone It s failing to sync which makes it completely useless
len ratingfive GREAT APP
len ratingthree I use everything Microsoft 
len ratingthree It s quick easy and everything s connected up until today 
len ratingthree I love using the To Do app on my desktop at home and at work using my organization s email on both the To Do app and on Teams is a breeze 
len ratingthree There was envelope integration for To Do in Teams 
len ratingthree It eliminates one extra window from being open 
len ratingthree However I checked my To Do list right now in my organization s Teams and my ToDo list is gone 
len ratingthree Upsetting as we re about to start a meeting about deadlines 
len ratingthree Disappointed as I do not have my laptop on me 
len ratingthree Hope this issue gets resolved 
len ratingthree I loved the integration 
len ratingone It does not work and it s very laggy and hard to find stuff
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingone I can t chat
len ratingfour Can you add the chat again please
len ratingthree I had to uninstall and install several times 
len ratingfive Very easy to use and love it
len ratingone I DONT LIKE IT Specially for school
len ratingtwo So I used teams for like a year now but you guys removed the chat I don t know if it s my school how did it or if it was an upgrade in teams ether way please at least try and bring back the chat cause I my friends don t have phone numbers and teams is the only app that uses a email that I know of so please try bringing back the chat thank you so much for reading 
len ratingtwo  Hi jdusbauxbhs sounds like you might have signed in to Teams with your personal Microsoft account instead of your school account 
len ratingtwo You can fix this by adding your school account from the main menu or by signing out from your personal account and then sign
len ratingtwo I installed teams yesterday and joined a call with only one other person on it 
len ratingtwo I later noticed my battery had drained and when I checked the usage Teams was responsible for of the use 
len ratingtwo Yikes 
len ratingone Okay so I did my homework right 
len ratingone And it was due at so I opened the assignments tab to turn it in 
len ratingone It wouldn t load 
len ratingone So I waited getting increasing anxious as time ticked by 
len ratingone I waited 
len ratingone And waited 
len ratingone And waited some more 
len ratingone Nine minutes came and went and by I was literally having a panic attack 
len ratingone Then right when the clock struck twelve it loaded 
len ratingone I kid you not right when it was too late to turn it in it loaded 
len ratingone Long story short I turned it in a minute late and I m very furious at Teams right now 
len ratingone Anyways it s a good app and I highly recommend it 
len ratingone This app doesn t even deserve a star 
len ratingone There are hardly any options the quality is bad you can t have a gallery view the most people you can see at a time is nine people there is no option to raise your hand virtually and there is a lot of echoing even if there are only a few people unmuted 
len ratingone I DON T RECOMMEND 
len ratingone Found out that this app is pasting clipboard text in app when you open the app 
len ratingone Please remove it ASAP
len ratingfive I love using it to contact my co workers 
len ratingfive That way i don t have to exchange my personal phone number 
len ratingfour The fact that you can t use devices at once 
len ratingfour I often answer a Teams call on my phone app but then can t easily transition to sharing screens on my computer 
len ratingfour Other than that it s been great during this wildly difficult time 
len ratingfour When I share I pad screen pupils can see my screen but they can t hear the sound of a video on the laptop they can hear the sound of the video but on I pad nooooo 
len ratingfive Teams is a great app 
len ratingfive I m doing my school with teams on ipad a feature I would like is to do backgrounds on iPad 
len ratingfive The app makes staying connect with my team so easy 
len ratingfive Very easy to send pictures and view files 
len ratingfour Me gusta mucho la app 
len ratingfour Es muy completa y permite trabajar muy bien 
len ratingfour Sin embargo tiene varios fallos relacionados con bugs que no permiten ver bien la pantalla compartida ya que est se ve completamente distorsionada no por falta de internet sino en serio distorsionada y de los colores que no son pero supongo que esto se arreglar pronto 
len ratingfour Las funciones del paquete de office en l nea son muy limitadas y no permite hacer muchas modificaciones grandes en un periodo corto de tiempo o se va a trabar 
len ratingfour Olviden las macros en l nea no van a funcionar as como muchas otras funciones importantes de la suite de office
len ratingone teema sis to the night club u go chile 
len ratingfive Cool app to use for work purposes 
len ratingfive Easy to use once you learn your way around 
len ratingfive Not many complaints yet 
len ratingthree With the latest update the audio controls to mute can break and you must hard exit the app and rejoin your meeting 
len ratingthree I ve also had the audio controls disappear on me and again had to restart the app to get them back 
len ratingfive After ios app is crashing when you share screen e try to open another app using multitasking 
len ratingfive This application is an excellent tool for bridging the gap with remote employees 
len ratingfive The app is very easy to use and is suited for all levels of technical aptitude 
len ratingone  My sons school district had a lot of issues with it 
len ratingone It was a nightmare 
len ratingone McKinley County Schools 
len ratingone Why does teams need to paste whatever is on my clipboard when I open it 
len ratingone Blatant violation of user trust and privacy 
len ratingfour It opens it crashes 
len ratingfour I got a new phone and it is better
len ratingone  Its ruining my life
len ratingone  Teams was not working 
len ratingone Issues leading me to miss some classes 
len ratingone I m very livid 
len ratingfive This is Prajith You just need to update teams
len ratingfive It s awesome another superior product by Microsoft
len ratingfive Wow
len ratingfive This is an awesome app it helps me stay in contact with people during COVID if I could give it million stars I definitely would
len ratingfive Teams
len ratingone Disconnects all the time 
len ratingone I have a solid internet connection and I am able to message my coworkers in other apps but teams breaks all the time 
len ratingone This app is pure trash 
len ratingone I get a login error on my iPad when trying to login to Teams App 
len ratingone It worked fine before update 
len ratingone Also there is no way to completely remove and reinstall the app 
len ratingone Even after clearing the cache uninstalling and reinstalling the app remembers my old login 
len ratingone Come on Microsoft this is a rookie move 
len ratingone Guess I can t use Teams until you decide to fix the issue 
len ratingone BTW I am connecting using a hybrid AD On Prem O GCC config 
len ratingone I can log in fine on a PC 
len ratingone It s terrible I m a kid and I press sign in and it does not work
len ratingfive In my opinion a good program is one that does not require a users manual 
len ratingfive I started using Teams and was able to do everything that I wanted without having to refer to documentation 
len ratingfive So good job teams is super intuitive it goes beyond my criteria of a good program 
len ratingfive This is a awesome app 
len ratingfive And my respects MS teams increases and individuals productivity throughout an average meeting 
len ratingone  Microsoft teams do not work so well
len ratingfive This app is perfect for continuing conversations from my PC to phone 
len ratingfive I never miss a beat 
len ratingfive This is the best MS product ever 
len ratingone This app allows me to participate in school so it s complete trash star
len ratingfive Yep it s awesome way better than Doom
len ratingfive This app is so easy to use for class and it s more efficient than zoom 
len ratingfive User friendly multi uses 
len ratingone The Teams app reads the contents of the clipboard after it logs you in 
len ratingone I m very interested in what Microsoft and my employer 
len ratingone are doing with the contents of the clipboard from my personal devices 
len ratingone Completely unacceptable behavior 
len ratingtwo  Bad very bugy a lot of bogs needs work
len ratingfive Es la mejor en su tipo
len ratingfive I actually use my desktop app for file sharing viewing and the phone app for messaging and joining calls 
len ratingfive Trying to do everything in one platform is a PITA 
len ratingfive But this option is nice 
len ratingfive The quality of joining calls via the app is amazing too 
len ratingthree We use teams for pretty much everything at work 
len ratingthree It works fine on desktop but almost every time I use it on mobile it either freezes crashes or never successfully opens 
len ratingthree It can be frustrating because we have to move around at work and there s been times where we get calls through teams and I never knew it came through because it struggles to work on my iPhone 
len ratingthree Other than that the app works fine 
len ratingthree  The app is convenient except that it doesn t give you access to Outlook email 
len ratingthree If Teams gives access to my calendar it should also allow me the option to view my email 
len ratingthree If some how this apps can easily work with a low or moderate internet connection that would be awesome 
len ratingthree But it s still a nice communication apps 
len ratingone I found out that even when I mute myself and turn off my cameras my teachers can STILL hear me 
len ratingthree After the last update I haven t been able to use teams 
len ratingthree I want a meeting link which I can share with nonuser of Team also 
len ratingone I hate this app like it s so bad it ruined myQuarantine
len ratingfour Inconsistent network performance occasional with calls consumes lot of system resources but very powerful app with lots of functionality and perks
len ratingone I don t like it because we have to go in every day
len ratingfour I use teams for work calls and it operates well 
len ratingfour It doesn t close out after long meetings I can do everything I need to do with the iPhone app 
len ratingfive Seems to be a responsive app that does what it s supposed to do 
len ratingfive I m new to Microsoft Teams Outlook etc but so far so good 
len ratingone As the title reads this app is just horrendous to use and for what I m using it for is even worse 
len ratingone First when put in team and doing assignments on mobile and turning them in then logging in on a desktop all the data get lost somehow and I end up having to do it again 
len ratingone Secondly I can t even get in a conference call with everyone because there s no button to allow me and when sent an invite by the host it immediately kicks me off the app and I have to redo everything 
len ratingone Third it s really hard to just navigate like it wasn t made to be user friendly and I really hate it 
len ratingone This app is so much worse then google classroom it s not even funny 
len ratingone Devs step your game up this app is complete trash 
len ratingone If I could give it a lower rating I would but sadly Apple doesn t allow negative criticism on their app store 
len ratingone Bad app that does not support browser access 
len ratingfive I m new to teams and the love it 
len ratingfive I just need to figure out how to balance my usage with email and teams 
len ratingone Nope
len ratingone  It scared my children
len ratingfive I have been opportuned to use quite a few apps and decided to take teams for a ride 
len ratingfive I couldn t help but be reminded of the good old MSN chat apps 
len ratingfive This is an advanced version that allows the audio as well as video calls 
len ratingfive The video doesn t freeze like other apps and I can also use it at work 
len ratingfive Keep it up Microsoft 
len ratingone Whatever updates you think you accomplished have been unsuccessful and am now unable to login to the app with my credentials
len ratingfive  Nice app good for school
len ratingfive It so good I love it
len ratingfive Love the app
len ratingfour Generally I really enjoy Microsoft teams 
len ratingfour One of my favorite features is the immersive reader 
len ratingfour Especially being dyslexic the reader really helps me understand the text without having to reread three or four times 
len ratingfour It has a really nice natural voice 
len ratingfour The bad thing about this app is that it does not include the immersive reader 
len ratingfour Pretty bummed about that 
len ratingfour Overall though it s a good app 
len ratingfour Seems like most of the low ratings are people who are being forced to use this program through school 
len ratingfour But for work this app works flawlessly and very easy to use 
len ratingfour The only thing we need now is a widget now that Apple iOS supports the feature 
len ratingone  Tengo un iPhone una Samsung Tab S y una tablet Samsung Galaxy y ninguna me deja colocar fondos de pantalla y me lo est n solicitando como puedo obtener este accesorio
len ratingone ITS HORRIBLE DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IT DOES NOT LET ME SEE MY CLASSES 
len ratingtwo My class doesn t even pop up sometimes it always glitches
len ratingtwo I can t always raise the hand the icon appears on my phone sometimes and sometimes it disappears
len ratingone The app is really confusing 
len ratingone I couldn t go on Bcs I got the link and couldn t go on 
len ratingfour Need the ability to have more channels or sub channels ability to have only designated members in a specific channel 
len ratingone take this off the appstore just like you was gonna to tiktok this don t work and if i get in trouble for YOUR site crashing on me lol i ain t got time for this is there a button to negative rate it like y all on my nerves and it s only in the morning chile 
len ratingthree Teams shouldn t let teachers change the due dates on assignments to prevent teachers from changing the due date of an assignment on the day it s due 
len ratingthree It s happened to me 
len ratingthree Teams also shouldn t let a teacher make a video call schedule on the current day to prevent last minute calls 
len ratingthree If teachers stop making last minute calls and schedule a video call meeting days earlier students can make time to be able to join the call 
len ratingfour Ms Teams is a great application but I cannot upload files during conference calls
len ratingfive There is a problem wan untouched are in meting wan some kick me from the meting I can see he name 
len ratingfive It need to show me like you Ben kick from name I wished you fix it that will help as thank you for reading my report
len ratingone Lag
len ratingfour I m a teams user and work well with it 
len ratingfour However the latest update has been causing my iPhone Pro running iOS to heat up each time I open it 
len ratingfour It s getting hot to the touch at the back and towards the power button 
len ratingfour Hopefully this can be remedied with a quick update 
len ratingfour  Something you need to fix is the status 
len ratingfour Sometimes the status says available and stays like that for the whole day even through The Whole night 
len ratingfour And other times it says the person is last seen even though your chatting with him 
len ratingfour Maybe you can fix this 
len ratingone Stupid app should be better better online class so stupif
len ratingone THIS APP IS DESTROYING MY WILL TO LIVE VOTE STAR SO ONLINE SCHOOL CAN BE SHUT DOWN
len ratingfour This is a huge let down in the app to try and take notes in another app or check on something quickly while in a meeting 
len ratingfour While in a call you add another app or use Slide Over and it cuts your video 
len ratingfive  It fum but I want from you to aptitude this team
len ratingtwo I can t raise my hand 
len ratingtwo my ios is My teachers angry on me because I can t raise my hand 
len ratingfour This app is good for school but it s just that our school not naming them will use this app to spy on us 
len ratingfour Even when we are not on the app staff from school can look through it 
len ratingfour My boyfriend told me one of his friends got a call from the school because his friend said a cuss word on iPhone messages 
len ratingfour It s messed up how school systems work and we never gave permission to the school to look through our phones 
len ratingone Not a fan 
len ratingone Too busy 
len ratingone Hate email trails and teams makes it worse 
len ratingone Too many conversations for one to keep up with 
len ratingone Some good features but the chat is just too busy and aggravating
len ratingone The app calendar only allows to invite internal organization only 
len ratingone I wanted set up meeting with client but since the domain is not same as my organization the calendar within Teams app will not allow me to add outside organization invitees 
len ratingfive  It s great to connect with friends and family 
len ratingfive Microsoft killed it with teams 
len ratingfive This allows me to manage both business at once and stay really organized 
len ratingfive That conference calling is excellent 
len ratingfive I like it better than zoom 
len ratingfive Keep killing it Microsoft Peter Kulturides CEO The Career Management platform
len ratingfour The app is good for talking and everything but I think you should get a notification when someone that you talk to a lot comes online
len ratingone This app is HORRIBLE 
len ratingone I have never felt more uncomfortable in a situation 
len ratingone The call quality is terrible and disconnecting is SO common 
len ratingone I shouldn t be forced to even do these classes 
len ratingone I am so disappointed 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate now that I had great support from our AGRs 
len ratingone I was in a meeting and it dropped my call and my computer started to glitch from this app 
len ratingone I keep having to delete and redownload this app because it almost never works 
len ratingone I have been late to multiple classes and I have been counted absent times this semester 
len ratingone I am not the only person having this problem 
len ratingone I am missing a lot of notes and important info for my classes 
len ratingone Fix this app 
len ratingfive I love it but I hate school lol
len ratingone  You need to download many other apps just to use teams
len ratingfive Honestly works just as great as the desktop app 
len ratingfive I ve done work meetings messaging file downloads 
len ratingfive Only thing is attaching sending pictures 
len ratingfive Don t know how to do that even on the desktop 
len ratingtwo i hate school but ig this app is cool also can u guys add mirror invert if u don t have it already 
len ratingtwo i don t wanna look ugly or unsymmetrical on camera 
len ratingfour Only reason why I m giving it stars is because my coworkers send too many messages 
len ratingfour Microsoft is great but i get overloaded with messages sometimes lol
len ratingfive Makes my life easier
len ratingone  Classes 
len ratingone Since updating to iOS I ve noticed that Microsoft Teams copies the contents of my clipboard whenever I switch to the app even when I m not trying to paste something in to a message 
len ratingone This is a big privacy concern for me 
len ratingone What else is Teams snooping on that it as no reason to do 
len ratingtwo Imagine needing this app for class and its full of problems 
len ratingtwo It will kick you out the call then when rejoin turn off audio so you can t hear your teachers 
len ratingtwo That s not even the beginning 
len ratingtwo It won t actually mute you half the time 
len ratingtwo Last thing I need is my teachers hearing what s going on in my house 
len ratingone We didn t need Cortana 
len ratingone We needed all the bugs fixed 
len ratingone We need the keyboard to not cover half the active chat anytime you switch back into it on the iPad 
len ratingone We need reactions to not place it s context menu in the upper right corner of the screen 
len ratingone We need proper text format continuity across platforms 
len ratingone What a joke 
len ratingone This may be a good app for adults at work but it is a terrible app for elementary school children and their parents 
len ratingone It is glitchy and the constant updates fix one problem and create another 
len ratingone One concrete example of how bad this is for kids is that the hang up button on video calls is right next to the dots that lead to features like raise hand Making it far too easy for kids to accidentally hang up on their class 
len ratingone This in turn leads to problems rejoining the class which sometimes doesn t work even when the teacher is clicking on admit Another example is that the video call does not present its buttons and tools the same way on different devices making it much harder for teachers help kids in real time find the features he or she wants the kids to use 
len ratingone These are simple design fixes that Microsoft doesn t pay attention to 
len ratingfour Too much performance needed for Teams Microsoft 
len ratingfive Great application
len ratingone Every time Teams or Outlook is opened it steals the text from your clipboard for no apparent reason 
len ratingone Very weird indeed 
len ratingfive Teams has allowed me to receive and relay individual or group messages in real time from coworkers within seconds 
len ratingfive It s quick and easy to use 
len ratingfive I m always having to do things in this Covid The way I can get messages join meetings and get calls on my cell is tremendously easy 
len ratingfive I m never out of touch and always accessible when I want to be 
len ratingfive This blows Skype away with stability and functionality 
len ratingfive I can view presentations and even video if I m in Starbucks or a place with Wi Fi 
len ratingfive Download it today if you use it on your laptop or work computer 
len ratingfive I am very happy with this app
len ratingfive Teams is very easy to learn and navigate 
len ratingone Whenever i need to submit my assignments for school i ll submit them and then a few days later ill check back on them 
len ratingone And guess what 
len ratingone It says it is overdue 
len ratingone This app is unreliable for school and honestly annoying as hell 
len ratingfive I have adhd and am pretty scatter brained 
len ratingfive I love the ability to go mute for long periods of time 
len ratingfive I can do anything from laundry to homework to exercise to wack to play my instrument 
len ratingfive It s great
len ratingfive This app is essential for our business 
len ratingfive Would love to see tighter Siri integration and an Apple Watch app that shows user list and who s talking and more if possible 
len ratingtwo Want to be able to select a Virtual Background as a default for all video calls and meetings 
len ratingtwo I m running iOS on my iPhone Xr and have already installed the most recent Teams update 
len ratingtwo The Long press on the Teams app to quickly initiate a call is NOT shown as an option 
len ratingtwo  Teams update installed and same problems exist 
len ratingtwo  Teams update installed and same problems exist 
len ratingtwo  The latest iOS and Teams update installed and same problems exist 
len ratingtwo I am so frustrated with this app on my iPhone and iPad 
len ratingtwo I m a teacher who is trying to hold classes on Teams and the record option disappeared from my Teams app after the first time I used it 
len ratingtwo I tried restarting my iPad 
len ratingtwo That didn t work 
len ratingtwo Then I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and finally the record option reappeared 
len ratingtwo As the organizer for these classes I should always gave the option to record 
len ratingtwo Please fix this app 
len ratingtwo There isn t enough time between my classes to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the darn app 
len ratingone Awful app in all the ways always crashing good internet signal and this app still says that the internet is weak and I lose time in classes
len ratingtwo Good functionality in general 
len ratingtwo Cannot use with personal MS account 
len ratingtwo If I m mistaken please enlighten me 
len ratingone On iOS there orange indicator shows that iOS captures audio even when it is muted 
len ratingone My messages stop working and now I can t talk to my teachers but over all it good
len ratingfive Great way to keep communicating with your team for quick and more informal communications
len ratingone I really need this app and can t get it to work 
len ratingone I ve tired everything and I really need this app for work 
len ratingone Fix your app please
len ratingfive I am so happy with Teams 
len ratingfive I like all the capabilities it offers and the clarity it provides with sound and camera 
len ratingfour I like teams but how do you start a meeting on iPhone 
len ratingfour I searched it up but the meet button isn t where it says it is 
len ratingfour Plz help
len ratingone  yeah
len ratingone They turn off the chat 
len ratingthree After every update it gets slower and slower 
len ratingthree And more crashes 
len ratingthree  In summary is ok 
len ratingthree I would like a meet now button on the mobile app version and a less confusing layout in the channels area I mean I would like to see more clearly where a post ends and the next one starts 
len ratingfive ok i came here to whine about how the program would be a thousand times better if there was a dark mode for teams but then i realized there IS a dark mode for teams thanks microsoft
len ratingone  It bearly works
len ratingone Download Teams amp Teams cannot be found in settings to allow cellular 
len ratingfive The teams app is amazing as it has great features to collaborate with colleagues as well as with your clients 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive  Teams is Awesome and very user friendly easy to access and maneuver through 
len ratingfive Efficient in all areas 
len ratingfive Calls chats and video conversation
len ratingtwo Just why did u have to disable the chats
len ratingtwo My school district forced everyone into using Teams and we have had nothing but problems 
len ratingtwo People are missing icons teachers cant record their meetings screen share wont work kids are getting stuck in lobbies and severe network issues 
len ratingtwo They need to get these bugs fixed because its in no way shape or form competent enough to keep up with the demands of the high school digital learning format 
len ratingone I can t send messages no more and I to send my work to my teacher so yeah
len ratingone I LITERALLY DONT LIKE MICROSOFT TEAMS ANYMORE BC IT TOOK MY CHATS OFF AND NOW I CANT TEXT MY FRIENDS 
len ratingfive We have switched to teams in our office with all the craziness 
len ratingfive I absolutely love it 
len ratingfive Great for collaborating from anywhere 
len ratingfour This is really good and easy Also there s a couple problems it s glitches and raises the students hand and mutes the teacher yes I am a student I m in rd grade but also it s very easy and awesome I rate u a 
len ratingfour I would rate u a but there is no 
len ratingfive Works well needs a bit of improvement in multi account management but overall great performance 
len ratingone THIS IS BROKEN IDONT WAANNA WAIT UGH
len ratingfive Teams allows me to talk with coworkers both by computer and cell in one stream 
len ratingfive I never have to worry about a computer based chat not being available on my phone or the reverse 
len ratingfive Teams can keep the conversations all in one string no matter what device I used 
len ratingone I don t like this app because I try to login and it keeps saying wrong password when I know that s the password
len ratingthree On both my phone and my laptop the latest updates seem to make it harder to get to your contacts list 
len ratingthree One my laptop is switched from a toggle to a drop down when you go to chat 
len ratingthree This only changes from one click to two after waiting a second for it to think but liked the old interface better 
len ratingthree On my phone I can t find contacts at all 
len ratingthree If I click chat I only see the chronological recent chat feed and can t find my alphabetical contact list 
len ratingthree Please bring this back 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingfive The translate of message is present right very useful thank you for this function 
len ratingfour I feel as though with microsoft teams when you click assignments you should be able to see all of your assignments and their due dates as well as which class it is for all on the same screen 
len ratingfour I constantly have to click on each one of my classes to figure out what i have due and if i have anything due that night 
len ratingfour Please update it that would be amazing and so helpful 
len ratingfive Features and performance make it like the desktop app no compromising
len ratingtwo It is crazy that I can not deleted used account when it was used for other people 
len ratingfive Out of all the communication and collaboration apps I have 
len ratingfive This one is the most efficient and easy to use 
len ratingtwo You re forcing me to clear the notification badge out of hours 
len ratingtwo I don t need that thing looming over me why can t it clear itself 
len ratingthree Overall it s a really good app and I ve been using it ever since quarantine from working from home 
len ratingthree The main pet peeve I have about the app is the fact when you make a phone call 
len ratingthree It does not indicate whether the person is picking up via telephone or video call 
len ratingthree When you dial a phone call the person you were dialing can pick up either way 
len ratingthree And often times when the phone initially connects it does not show the video call but when I hang up I see the person picked up be via video on their side 
len ratingthree So it s as if they ve been looking in my ear the entire time 
len ratingthree There is a pause when the call initially connects so you don t know how the other person connected 
len ratingthree Unless u pull back and check after you have started the call 
len ratingone Bad app it is bad 
len ratingtwo I m using a third party keyboard and the send button is overlapping and cannot send 
len ratingtwo I have to scroll down and to send my message but that doesn t work all the time 
len ratingtwo The keyboard is called Gboard by Google 
len ratingone What happened opened link previously installed app on device but app offloaded when memory got low error message appears when opening teams meeting link saying address is invalid I bring it up to my leadership team that the link is bad when it isn t as soon as I noticed app was offloaded reinstalled and opened link just fine 
len ratingone Please fully test and develop your application properly to give the end user the correct information so they don t look like a fool when it was a simple matter 
len ratingone Thanks
len ratingfive I ve been using teams for a bit and I love it 
len ratingfive It s so smooth lots of features and very easy to use 
len ratingfive Highly recommend it 
len ratingfive I like it a lot but I think there should be notifications for when a meeting is started 
len ratingfive That s all good app easy to use just that one thing 
len ratingfive Its great app help me work on the go and also attend meeting but I wish they allow two login as I work for two company 
len ratingtwo There are several serious issues with the app creating a team from the app won t register the team will not be able to change photo will not be able to create a meeting until i work with a team on a desktop 
len ratingtwo  recorded meetings will not download open with stream does not work 
len ratingtwo  would appreciate if some key settings for teams and meetings be available 
len ratingfive I never thought I would be able to work so efficiently from my phone 
len ratingfive It s really amazing 
len ratingone I m Just a Teenager Who is Just trying to enjoy there break But No 
len ratingone I GUESS SCHOOL REALLY DOES RUIN EVERYTHING like seriously There s A virus going on some people are stressed out About this amp School just makes them more stress by giving them assignments with this Virus going on School isn t important Yes kid s Needs to learn But Still there s just a lot going on And School Shouldn t give kids who are Scared of the virus more stress Like For real Can Schools just Give people breaks from school 
len ratingone  I know I sound like a little immature kid on the Internet But Believe me i hate this virus amp I m worried too And School is stressing me more out 
len ratingone I don t hate Microsoft teams I just hate on How School has to continue During this whole virus 
len ratingthree Voice messages cannot recorded created from desktops And the Android recording issue isn t solved yet
len ratingfour Would love to delete remove organizations off my account but there s no simple way of doing it
len ratingone  why do my teachers tell me I have to ask to use the bathroom 
len ratingone You don t pay the bills
len ratingfour I feel like the app drains my battery and when I walk away from my computer or phone for one minute it already says I m away 
len ratingfour And there should be a shortcut to dial in when connection is slow 
len ratingtwo  the app suddenly whenever it wants kicks you from a meeting or sometimes it lags out or you cant even open the app 
len ratingone It s just bad 
len ratingone C 
len ratingfive Works really well offering all the features the desktop app does in the most compact form 
len ratingfive Great app kudos MS 
len ratingfive I enjoy this app 
len ratingfive It is easy to navigate and helpful to get assistance ASAP 
len ratingfour The app is so good i recommend to everyone but i have a problem So im in Morocco specifically marrakesh and i installed Microsoft teams for studying and stuff but when i enter my phone number they say it isn t correct but it is because i already used it in so many apps before and i guess it s because that the number begins with not as usual in Morocco so please i really need help like support or something for my problem here so i can you fix this problem as soon as possible please 
len ratingfour Contact me please if you need more information
len ratingone Hay mejores plataformas
len ratingfive  Good app but every sec it turns to a black screen then it goes back to normal pls fix this
len ratingfive Microsoft has finally impressed me with this app 
len ratingtwo  I hate this app it s always kicking me out crashing being soooo slow speech gets disoriented and my teach disabled the chat the then turned it back on and several people still can t do it 
len ratingtwo One of the calls we couldn t even do 
len ratingtwo And when I went to music a music class that was canceled was still there so I was stuck in the wrong meeting for minutes 
len ratingtwo Then the correct meeting comes on finally but I get kicked out times in a row 
len ratingtwo And there s only minutes of music left 
len ratingtwo So now I m considered basically absent to music 
len ratingtwo I HATE teams it deserves stars 
len ratingtwo Zoom is better 
len ratingtwo  percent of the stars are probably fake 
len ratingtwo BTW fix your problems 
len ratingtwo Updated It s worse Updated once more Chats ok more star still bad tho
len ratingfive It s nice
len ratingtwo It s a good app sure but it like it was only made for mobile users 
len ratingtwo When using it on PC it basically hates not being the center of attention 
len ratingtwo It will lag your computer if you have even just one window other than it opened 
len ratingtwo I would write a review on my computer but everything is laggy and it won t even let me type in characters without almost freezing for a good minute or two 
len ratingtwo The PowerPoint feature is good and that s really the only redeeming quality about it 
len ratingtwo Other then that I don t like it and would definitely use a different app to do my work and meet with peers
len ratingone NO ME DEJA HACER NADA Y YO NO QUIERO COJER CLASES ESTOY ARTA XD
len ratingfive This app is necessary if you are managing a remote team 
len ratingtwo I can edit my meetings through meeting chats but now I cannot 
len ratingtwo While calendar shows only the event in the upcoming week there is no way to edit past events or bi weekly events that is more than one week from today 
len ratingone the connection is horrible things don t send when they have to and the chat has a limit amount of chats this is terrible
len ratingone When I started online school we used teams to turn in assignments and work 
len ratingone I personally disliked the app because the visuals were confusing and unappealing 
len ratingone If the app had more color and had a section for extra credit assignments I would be pleased by it 
len ratingone This is why I am so glad our school is now using Google classroom 
len ratingthree We can t share sound when we share videos from YouTube When we share display and we share YouTube videos the other say we don t hear the sound 
len ratingthree Could you fix it please 
len ratingfour Great tools for Teams 
len ratingfour Meetings with customers and group presentations are perfect on Teams 
len ratingfour  Please add include sounds button for video and make it possible to download attendance list
len ratingone  I HATE THIS STUPID APP IT ASKS U FOR NUDES AND PERSONAL INFO
len ratingone Connecting to a call is very difficult and it will not even let me sign up on computer for school forcing me to use this horrible app
len ratingfour Teams has worked fantastic for virtual communication but the virtual meeting platform could use some extra love to allow registration options and more depth in general 
len ratingfour Ok first of all this app is working 
len ratingfour You can get into calls and whatever 
len ratingfour That s the only thing actually good about it 
len ratingfour Problems I have VERY often No First of all this app is not bad bad 
len ratingfour It s fine 
len ratingfour Why 
len ratingfour Because of all the bugs in this app 
len ratingfour The main thing is basically the chatting and meeting 
len ratingfour That s fine 
len ratingfour No problems with that 
len ratingfour But when I want to leave the app and go to another app like YouTube Roblox Google etc 
len ratingfour As I click on an app it will immediately kick me out of the meeting which is very very annoying 
len ratingfour So then I ll have to keep joining back every time I want to go to another app 
len ratingfour No Second problem is that when I m in a call of people are trying to type in the chat I can t see the chat 
len ratingfour This is really irritating because sometimes they type in chat very important stuffs and I can t see the chat 
len ratingfour Yes I know there is a button on the top right hand corner that say s Chat but if I click on that I won t see the chat either way 
len ratingfour No one s typing in the chat but they are 
len ratingfour Very weird 
len ratingfour However that s not that bad since I can just ask what it is because I can t see the chat 
len ratingfour No This one is also quite irritating 
len ratingfour I can never be able to join a team 
len ratingfour So then I try a link to join the team 
len ratingfour This pops up and says Team deleted or your no longer in this team I click ok then something else pops saying Join Team click that nothing even happens 
len ratingfour Yes there is a code to join a team however that doesn t work I try to enter the code and when I m done typing in the code it doesn t me bring me to the team 
len ratingfour In conclusion This app has a lot of bugs 
len ratingfour But it s also quite a good app 
len ratingfour The first problem happens very often but sometimes not 
len ratingfour The other two happens all the time 
len ratingfour I really don t know if it s something with my device like the type Mobile Pc Laptop etc 
len ratingfour or maybe the version 
len ratingfour All in all this app has some bugs but it s useable 
len ratingfour  Thank you for reading this super long review tho 
len ratingthree i hate that when i m in a call but i m on a different tab doing work 
len ratingthree when i go back to the call there s this little tab saying Are you still there i would press the im back option but it will reload and kick me out the call and i ll have to ask for permission to join the call all over again and i m in school so it will look sketchy that i left the call
len ratingfour As an Executive Assistant would like to have the option to manage additional calendars 
len ratingone Ifjfndjfjf
len ratingone  my teachers are making me use it
len ratingone I m getting really mad at the app it doesn t show some of my classes and out of no where it doodles and lags it s like if fornite was on a laggy Flip phone it doodles of and turns my camera on or microphone when it wants to not when I don t want to and the lagging makes my teacher freeze and boom there on a lesson and a class mate is asking me to help them and it s just takes me out and just now that app closed on its self
len ratingfour Makes work possible 
len ratingfour We have so many things to manage that it would be impossible to organize communication for various project categories without something like Teams 
len ratingfour The best features are the chat rooms and threads because sending quick files and pictures is speedy and easy on the go 
len ratingfour Meetings are great too because the calendar shows times topics and allows a quick join via notification when someone starts the meeting even if it s a few minutes late so you re not wasting time in an empty conference 
len ratingfour Adding guests and external meeting members is relatively easy and works better than other programs I ve used at previous jobs 
len ratingfour Calls sound as good as normal phone calls video chat works great even over cellular and consulting with teammates then transferring them calls works smoothly 
len ratingfour A few very minor bugs have not hampered my enjoyment of Teams much but I do have to mention them to be honest Voicemails don t usually play until I click on several voicemails back and forth and when they start they often don t output audio via Bluetooth accessories speakerphone or receiver only unless I had the aforementioned wireless headset connected when opening the app so closing reopening the app often fixes that but not always 
len ratingfour  If I have poor cellular reception there is audio lag between people on the phone so we re sometimes accidentally speaking over each other 
len ratingfour This is likely just an inherent complication of translating secure digital audio into something cellular carriers accept as I don t usually experience this when connected to WiFi or with strong cellular signal 
len ratingfour  Copy paste works ok if you want the entire message but if you just want a phone number email website or street address within a paragraph it can sometimes be trickier since it tries to intelligently add metadata to the copied text so it can open the corresponding app 
len ratingfour Pasting inside an edited message often doesn t place the pasted text where the cursor is but instead puts it near the end of the message or in a random spot that might be in the middle of a word 
len ratingfour The workaround is simply creating the edit in an external note app 
len ratingfour All in all I could never go back to the old apps I ve used for work and have enjoyed having our entire company s internal communications in one place except where emails are more appropriate of course 
len ratingfour Happy to see the new features and improvements we ve enjoyed over the years and excited to see how it gets even better going forward 
len ratingone VIRUSES naw just hate school 
len ratingfive Teams works great to get a face to face meeting together 
len ratingfive You can quickly schedule a meeting and teams will notify your group 
len ratingfive Works good for crews working in the field 
len ratingfive They can sign on from the car the office the hotel room 
len ratingfive You can have a regularly scheduled time or pull up a meeting in minutes 
len ratingfive It works great 
len ratingfour Can t accommodate more than 
len ratingfour No notice provided when maxed out so callers don t know why connection cannot be made 
len ratingfour My company has implemented Office so I chose to standardize on Teams as a one stop place for my team for communications 
len ratingfour I like how you can integrate so many different apps for project management 
len ratingfour I also like how Incan get notifications or communicate easily on any device quickly using the Teams apps 
len ratingfour The only issue is discovering more ways to use teams effectively such as best practice 
len ratingfour I have also noticed that sometimes connecting or network issues are a problem 
len ratingfour Overall I think it is a nice product that appears to be getting better 
len ratingfour They just need to work more on connectivity issues although some could be related to individual networks 
len ratingtwo  the app suddenly whenever it wants kicks you from a meeting of in a worst case scenario doesn t work at all 
len ratingfive My school is very happy with teams because it really helped us so thank u
len ratingone Hate school
len ratingone terrible app it needs to be shut down 
len ratingone I can t open the tab and doesn t show all my files
len ratingone Useless
len ratingfour I really love the Microsoft s teams app and find that there s nothing wrong with it except I find that I look weird on others computers because it flips it so if there s ANY WAY that could be fixed the app would be perfect 
len ratingfive Fricken amazing being connected to work all the time
len ratingone Teams and anything with Microsoft is bad OneDrive anything it s so bad I rather use google services please make it better it is one star it deserves
len ratingone If you want something to go wrong every day select Microsoft teams you constantly get kicked off students will not be able to get logged back in you cannot control any features and it s horrible on your Wi Fi 
len ratingfour Problems I ve encountered Sharing video clips just does not seem to work The video chat feature lack features like breakout rooms 
len ratingfour It also seems to not be as clear a connection as other programs 
len ratingfive We need teams so we can learn and the most important thing is it lags
len ratingfour The biggest gripe is when you schedule a teams meeting everyone gets invited even if you deselect the automatic adds before you send the appointment 
len ratingfour The rest is pretty good
len ratingone sashineleba sashineleba sashineleba sashineleba Madloba 
len ratingthree I want to be able to change my account profile picture 
len ratingthree I am a student and my teachers want us to change our pictures so that they can see us and know what we look like but now that Teams updated and changed that ability I can t change it 
len ratingthree I had a profile picture before but now it s gone 
len ratingfour Not letting me answer calls
len ratingthree  I only use Teams for work and the app is fine for me 
len ratingthree However I don t like that I cannot delete some of these messages in Chat 
len ratingthree Serious upgrade needed because that part is annoying 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingone Trash
len ratingtwo The app freezes whenever I open it on my iPad so I can t use it 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingtwo If you are a teacher looking to get an app for the classroom please get google classroom 
len ratingtwo It s better in every way
len ratingfive I can t find the teams icon to join a meeting and I think maybe my iPad is old or the app needs to update but I hope you can find a way to fix it or at least tell me what s going on 
len ratingthree Teams is a great app and the only problem i have with it is when i use it on my phone 
len ratingthree The screen blacks out randomly and completely 
len ratingthree I ve done things to try and avoid this glitch like refrain from using other apps or interacting with things that wouldn t normally be necessary but every time i get a blacked out and frozen screen 
len ratingthree I hope you can fix this bug soon 
len ratingone I hate this cause I hate school 
len ratingfour Need to be able to modify surveys Delete and redo them as well

len ratingfour Teams good program happy with it 
len ratingfive There are so many glitches
len ratingfive The raise hand thingy isn t on my ipad 
len ratingfour To much lag and kicked out a lot
len ratingone I hate this school app
len ratingone Do not get this no matter what the connection is trash and you are very glitchy I ve tried both zoom and teams on different devices and zoom is better 
len ratingone Everybody is like oh zoom can get hacked it s happened a few times teams is so much safer ya zoom can get hacked but so can teams 
len ratingone Zoom preforms way better I recommend downloading that instead of this trash
len ratingone Very bad quality do not like
len ratingone It s trash
len ratingthree When will we be able to raise hands on iPhone and iPad 
len ratingone This app is garbage you lose a lot of connection and the clothes are way expensive
len ratingone Hi iam a Teacher and iam using this app in my iPad and my iPhone 
len ratingone The problem is when inside the class i can t shot down the mic for the students they make noise and make other students never hear my voice 
len ratingone Also in PC app there is a way to end the meeting with one button Unfortunately not included iPhone and iPad 
len ratingone I hope you help me and the other Teachers whom Suffering All The For You 
len ratingthree Overall it s a good app it could use a bit of work though 
len ratingthree The app sometimes crashes and it won t let me tap anything 
len ratingthree There s also many problems about the quality of the calls 
len ratingfive I use this app for audio only along with my laptop 
len ratingfive Other similar apps have an audio only mode 
len ratingfive I recommend this 
len ratingfive Somewhere in between Skype and Slack would recommend the app
len ratingone Lag
len ratingfive The best app for teachers but we hop to keep the app for ipad same the laptop 
len ratingfive Sync really well with desktop teams application 
len ratingfive Provides almost all functionality of what desktop application provides
len ratingthree Sound in my computer during calls is of poor quality 
len ratingthree I receive comments from others on the call that they can t hear me well and I have to call back from my phone 
len ratingone This app is terrible
len ratingone First day trying to use app and I couldn t connect To a meeting 
len ratingone Zoom is a thousand times easier to connect 
len ratingone I get on the app to search for meeting and can t find anything to help 
len ratingone The word meeting doesn t even come up in search 
len ratingone It kept saying we couldn t complete call
len ratingtwo Bruh so outdated
len ratingfour  I m a th grader at my middle school and even I need to complain about some things 
len ratingfour The reason I gave this a star was because of some of the things you guys need to improve on Could you guys add a delete your comment button 
len ratingfour Today my iPad was laying on my keyboard and the button were pressed on and when I clicked off my meeting it was on my page 
len ratingfour Everyone saw it so yeah I d like you to add that 
len ratingfour This would be my only complaint but beside that I d like everyone who s reading this to have a nice day 
len ratingfour Please be a little faster
len ratingone The app is very laggy and has many issues and bugs audio is cut out of the meeting times I find that way too much
len ratingfive And really love the background scrubbing
len ratingone It doesn t allow me to sign in 
len ratingone It just spins and asked me to re enter password
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone i dont like school
len ratingfive Teams hands down the best app for videos calls messaging for your company 
len ratingfive Just overall great
len ratingtwo There is this stupid glitch that makes me not get in meatings
len ratingfive I like it but it needs improvement because white board is bad
len ratingthree Raise hand option is not available disappointed
len ratingtwo Wth
len ratingone  It opens it crashes
len ratingtwo I always used ms teams in my ipad but when I used it on my desktop I could see the big difference 
len ratingtwo This app pales in comparison to the one on the desktop 
len ratingone I hate how you can t join other people s teams 
len ratingone How will other people join my group 
len ratingtwo This app is really annoyed me these few days it doesn t work properly I can t even access to my class now but lucky there s no test or quiz it just really need to fix things up as fast as it could
len ratingfive I love this app it is so easy to contact everyone quickly and efficiently
len ratingfive This app helps you maintain your focus on the claimant and have the ability to stay in tune with your team 
len ratingfive I highly advise this app to people who work remotely or with large groups 
len ratingfive Also you can use your own emojis and text format through your phone instead of desktop format 
len ratingfive Nice job
len ratingone I hate school
len ratingone Seems like a social media for work 
len ratingone Miss Skype wish Skype could ve been improved on 
len ratingone Seems like a really big buyout for MS to get the rights to Skype then ditch it
len ratingone My phone blacks out when I m in a call so I think it brought a virus
len ratingthree Can you fix a bug were I cannot unmute the microphone on iPhone 
len ratingthree Please fix this bug 
len ratingthree This app needs to be updated 
len ratingfive Me gusta todo en un solo lugar videos 
len ratingfive Llamadas 
len ratingfive Chats 
len ratingfive Reuniones 
len ratingfive Archivos 
len ratingfive Trabajo en colaboraci n y calendario 
len ratingone  WHY CAN IPAD USERS CHANGE THERE BACKGROUND PLEASE ADD THAT IN THE NEXT UPDATE ITS ANNOYING AND JUST RUDE 
len ratingfive Really easy to transition between Teams meetings and chat features 
len ratingfive Great communication tool 
len ratingone An absolute piece of garbage my school is using it and it is impossible to navigate it s not able to do a video call correctly none of my assignments turn in it doesn t connect to my internet and it can t even support one small school in Idaho 
len ratingone Piece of crap would do zero if I could
len ratingfive My kids use Microsoft Teams for their online classes 
len ratingfive On the assignment tab you click on an assignment and there is an attachment 
len ratingfive Now you can no longer send then attachment to a printer as the options button has been removed 
len ratingfive Please help 
len ratingfive Team has met and apparently exceeded my expectations performing at its level 
len ratingfive I ve become more comfortable with this platform as my confidence has grown over the time using it 
len ratingfive For me and the rest of the professional world this is a critical tool to have in facing the challenges surrounding our modern times 
len ratingfive It s nice to have the same confidence that the App performs as well as the Desktop version 
len ratingfive I have found that whether it be a quick Chat note or a colleague sharing a quick update to a presentation it s at my finger tips on the go 
len ratingfive Teams is awesome and so is the APP 
len ratingfive  Teams is good the only thing is that it won t let me log in
len ratingfive Something happened to the chat
len ratingone It is really bad ima leave it at that
len ratingone It s so lame that this iOS App does not have support for TTS support 
len ratingone So much for Microsoft supporting those with disabilities 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone It s terrible 
len ratingone Its horrible 
len ratingone teams should be a cuss word if it isn t already 
len ratingthree Working ok but interferes with Skype also receiving interruptions because of internet shortage even the signal is ok 
len ratingfive The app is good My school provide me details of login I am using since last months But the problem is from last update Now I cannot take out print or share assignment in my Ipad In my android phone it works fine Please check it out
len ratingfive So I have been using this for school and I would like to make a suggestion for the next update 
len ratingfive Fix all the bugs 
len ratingfive Please kindly fix it cause whenever I join a meeting it Lags 
len ratingfive Thank You and have a nice Day Night 
len ratingfour  So teams is the best app to communicate during quarantine and I agree that this app is amazing but I have a problem I m using tablet so sometimes when my lesson starts it doesn t show up 
len ratingfour It shows that the lesson is recording but I can t find a way to enter 
len ratingfour Fix this problem I haven t entered several times just because I d this problem 
len ratingfour I would like more flexibility to use photos in the app 
len ratingtwo Every single time I use Teams on iPhone the volume is just set to and my ears couldn t handle the loudness 
len ratingtwo It is so loud and terrible that I now have hearing disabilities during quarantine 
len ratingtwo I don t want to compare anything but even Skype has this function I just can t believe that a year old communication app has better user experiences than this 
len ratingtwo Disappointed I do not recommend using Teams 
len ratingfive I can t say I have mastered TEAMS I have 
len ratingfive What can say it s the most used tool in my tool box 
len ratingone  It made a giraffe come to my house and knock it over then I went to my friends house and then an elephant came and trashed the house
len ratingtwo It is really annoying when I get error message when I install it in my old iPads
len ratingone I hate this app because the new update doesn t let you will talk with people 
len ratingfive Teams is so much better and so good it s hard to describe 
len ratingfive They add so many great features it s hard to take advantage of them all 
len ratingfive Not your dads MSFT
len ratingfive This app it s the favorite way for students to work on Teams but the last update doesn t work very well 
len ratingfive In assignments students can t download or print docs when I used the whiteboard on a meeting student with iPads can t see the Whiteboard 
len ratingfive I hope and wait for another update with this bug fixed 
len ratingone  Now that school is virtual for children schools are forcing these apps on parents 
len ratingone I refuse to use something I don t want and that takes up storage space on my phone 
len ratingone If everyone is required to wear masks for a fake virus then it should be a choice if a parent wants to home school their children without having these stupid apps forced on parents and being told their negligent for choosing not to use these apps 
len ratingone So the app works perfectly fine but there is one concern I m worried about 
len ratingone So now that we ve started online school ive had teams on my phone but many people have said that if you had teams on your phone it can go through your phone or your school can go through your phone by the app 
len ratingone So I would like for you guys to not go through all our stuff because that s very personal information 
len ratingone Thank you for your time 
len ratingfive  This is one of the best product from Microsoft after windows office products 
len ratingfour When I m away from the computer the Teams app on my iPhone integrates seamlessly with the desktop 
len ratingfour Love the chat features 
len ratingfour Calls come in and can be done easily just like any other phone call 
len ratingfour Audio is clear even when I m on the go and using mobile data 
len ratingfour I took off one star because my only issue is that the calendar items take a bit long to sync when changes are made through Teams on my Macbook and it has thrown me off a few times thinking I missed meetings Otherwise I love it 
len ratingone For some reason this past week I have not been able to access from my phone it freezes on the home screen not rude what to do as this is a requirement for my school 
len ratingfive Stocks are gonna rise because of Corona 
len ratingfive Well it s a very useful tool for schoolwork
len ratingone The mute option doesn t work in the mobile app 
len ratingfive I m happy that my organization switched to Teams 
len ratingfive There s noticeable improvement in how content is delivered during meetings 
len ratingfive Less lag interruption and glitching 
len ratingfour App works great and helps my team stay informed and organized 
len ratingfour Would love it if we had the functionality to adjust the order of my channels 
len ratingfour A click and drag function of sorts 
len ratingfive Using the alerts on my Apple Watch I haven t missed a single meeting since I installed the app 
len ratingone App doesn t load on ipad 
len ratingone Deleted and re downloaded multiple times and it never goes past the teams logo 
len ratingone Only once did it work properly and the next day when I went to use it it didn t work again 
len ratingone Very disappointing specially since I need this app for virtual schooling
len ratingfive  So hi this app is really good and i use this for online class I really like it it glitches on the video call sometimes but besides that it s So yes bye 
len ratingfive Quick easy to manage where your people groups or clients are 
len ratingfive Comes with high quality video and audio time 
len ratingfive Basically like an office in the palm of your hand or lap lol considering what instrument you are using 
len ratingthree  When I go into a meeting it says would you like to join on this device 
len ratingthree Even though there is no other device I am on I say sure but then it turns the audio off so I can t hear them 
len ratingthree There is like no way to turn the audio back on 
len ratingthree They also have another glitch I go in the meeting and I try to click something but it doesn t let me 
len ratingthree Also when I share my screen or go on another app it ends the meeting randomly 
len ratingthree Other than this it s actually pretty decent 
len ratingfive I use Microsoft Teams for school an it is astonishing I understand that it is working so and kinda bad because there is school and work now 
len ratingfive Overall this app is the best in my opinion 
len ratingfive I love it but you should do a little bit of updating and it would be better 
len ratingone Sooooo I had a class on teams for school 
len ratingone I downloaded the app and went through a link and said CALL ENDED BUT IT LEGIT JUST STARTED
len ratingone  How long does it take a Microsoft team engineers to add the feature to add customized backdrop change loop video clip and picture to the phone app 
len ratingone Never 
len ratingone Come on guys it s not that hard to code and it s an important feature to have 
len ratingone Any other group video chat apps out there can do that already 
len ratingone Do you guys really want to wait till the Pandemic is over and then add this feature 
len ratingfive We love our teams program 
len ratingfive We use it daily for a variety of things and have had no issues 
len ratingfive I would highly recommend others to use it as well 
len ratingone  no
len ratingfive This a great app to use to share documents pictures and have team meetings 
len ratingfour When calling into teams calls my battery gets chewed up quickly 
len ratingfour Other than that it s awesome and very minimal bugs
len ratingone The app won t let me and my classmates get in 
len ratingone My teacher has to post a new link each day and it s the same one 
len ratingone It s so laggy 
len ratingone Google meet was better but some kids had to ruin it for us 
len ratingone SMH 
len ratingfive Teams is a good way to do your homework or meet your friends or teachers
len ratingone There should be a beauty filter 
len ratingone Zoom has one and it s wayyyyy better 
len ratingone And understanding how to use teams is really difficult 
len ratingfour Only thing I would fix is to be able to access past conversations 
len ratingfive I like the app reason it is secure and names can be used 
len ratingfive Also you could have a meeting anywhere anytime 
len ratingone hihihihihihihihihi ok bye now hehe i put star
len ratingone It keeps disconnecting and booting me out mid useage 
len ratingone  I get the response that I don t have network connection meanwhile I have network 
len ratingfour Anger management court appointed classes use this app 
len ratingfour First of all I d like to say it s a great app for collaboration and it has helped me in attending college 
len ratingfour My college uses it for online classes so yeah that s cool 
len ratingfour Please I have a really tiny request 
len ratingfour It ll be great if you accept it 
len ratingfour PLEASE OH PLEASE CHANGE THE TUNE THAT PLAYS WHEN JOINING A CALL OR WHEN SEARCHING FOR NETWORK 
len ratingfour  IT S VERY VERY ANNOYING 
len ratingfour Other than that it s a great app 
len ratingfour Well that got repetitive 
len ratingone Senda porquer a de aplicaci n
len ratingfour This app is helpful and is fun to use but can be extremely frustrating at times 
len ratingfive This app makes being apart from our team easier 
len ratingfive When jumping into a meeting it is easy to present edit and work as a team 
len ratingfive The integration is much better with the desktop app than it ever was with Lync Skype for Business 
len ratingone Terrible terrible
len ratingfive I don t normally write app reviews but I am going out of my way to give Microsoft Teams stars because we use it at my workplace and it has been a game changer 
len ratingfive Way more streamline and reliable than other teleconference applications 
len ratingthree It s really really glitchy and unorganized in the meetings 
len ratingthree But I like how it has the share screen and raise hand features 
len ratingthree I also like how it can connect to OneNote Word etc 
len ratingone Me dio cancer
len ratingfive I just started working at a company that uses Teams and I ve been really pleasantly surprised at how well it works 
len ratingfive I m a fan 
len ratingone So I have a best friend and I can t talk to her because u removed chat 
len ratingone I would really love for you to add back chat 
len ratingfour Very complicated at first but after that it s good
len ratingfour Despu s de usar la aplicaci n para la computadora estoy usando la versi n IPad para mi hija y me gustar a que se asemejara m s a la versi n de la computadora particularmente el calendario los fondos de pantalla y que el cono para subir la mano est en la pantalla principal 
len ratingfive Much better than wading through email spam less complicated than SharePoint and less cluttered than social media for business communication 
len ratingfive I ve never yet seen an instance where this app has failed 
len ratingthree  It s ight but I hate my teacher she is a Karen nice app tho
len ratingtwo Was working at a multinational 
len ratingtwo Just connected to teams using my Hotmail account 
len ratingtwo It successfully sent me an OTP which I entered 
len ratingtwo Then it gave me a that s not valid message 
len ratingtwo Now after repeatedly trying to open Teams it crashes for me on opening 
len ratingfive  Good could use some music
len ratingone I downloaded this for my school account now when I try to access through the app on my phone I get the message the browser isn t supported try downloading the app 
len ratingone I am already using the app 
len ratingone What now 
len ratingfive Please keep CVR for the National Guard it took a pandemic to get my soldiers on here and if we dissolve CVR for a new version of teams it will be months of work again to get the entire platoon back on the system 
len ratingfive I absolutely love CVR in Teams so please do not take this tool away from the National Guard Leaders 
len ratingfive This is the one system the army has utilized that all users love and can work easily across all demographics tech friendly or not 
len ratingfive It s amazing it let s you do school work and more
len ratingthree I have the teams app on both my laptop and my cell phone 
len ratingthree When I log off of my computer and change my status to away it will randomly change me to available even though I never open the app or login to my computer 
len ratingthree This makes it difficult because people think I am available when I am not 
len ratingone it s so laggy and doesn t show my work 
len ratingone I am a teacher and have been using Microsoft teams as my classroom platform since my school requires it 
len ratingone Teams crashes all the time 
len ratingone My students constantly have trouble uploading assignments 
len ratingone They always have to restart the teams app to get it to work properly 
len ratingone Also when using teams on my laptop it makes my computer hot and the fan turns on full blast because running teams takes up about of my computer usage 
len ratingone Do not use Teams for school use 
len ratingone Use google classroom 
len ratingone It is so much better 
len ratingone Microsoft teams constantly freezes echos kicks people out and sometimes on the calendar tab it doesn t show most of your classes 
len ratingfive Enjoy user friendly format and all the cloud environment offers 
len ratingone just use zoom 
len ratingone the whole UI and everything is playing bad
len ratingone cant even give zero stars 
len ratingfive Helpful to me
len ratingthree  Holaaaa 
len ratingthree No hay forma de compartir audio cuando se proyecta video 
len ratingthree No podr an solucionar esto 
len ratingthree Es una limitaci n muy grande para quienes damos clases a trav s de Teams 
len ratingthree Saludos Jennifer
len ratingfour Difficult to share multiple screen with ease 
len ratingone completely useless
len ratingone Grammar check is so simple and Microsoft cannot implement it 
len ratingtwo I need the option to turn off incoming teams calls for the mobile app 
len ratingtwo Chat features are fine they re easy to ignore when I m not primarily working 
len ratingtwo But the incoming phone call option is more intrusive 
len ratingtwo I had to uninstall until you fix that functionality 
len ratingfive Productive for work 
len ratingfive Seamless across multiple devices
len ratingfour Skype is simpler 
len ratingfour MS Teams chat is too busy
len ratingfive Better than desktop version 
len ratingfive Great app and easy to navigate
len ratingfive I think MS Teams is great app with better Security and additional features that Zoom doesn t have 
len ratingfive I know there are people who say that Zoom is more intuitive but personally I don t agree 
len ratingfour During design reviews need to be able to sketch on the presenters screen like Webex is able to do currently you have to screen shot the presenters screen then share my screen and sketch Webex is live and can do that on the presenters screen without the fuss
len ratingfour i am a very insecure th grader who regularly uses this app for online school 
len ratingfour my crush is in my class and i really think there should be an inverted filter so our faces don t look lopsided haha
len ratingfive I love this app I can talk to all my friends from school and because of the virus stoping ur form seeing each other we can just call 
len ratingone bad it is too many bugs 
len ratingfive It a great app for school I love team
len ratingfive I am this from months it s so much useful for me for daily meetings and daily work activities
len ratingfour  I love Microsoft Teams it works great 
len ratingfour The reason why I didn t put stars is because there sometimes a lot of problems with creating a meeting so that is something that they should work on besides that it is perfect it is basically Messages and phone and FaceTime rolled into one 
len ratingfour I hope lots of people use this app
len ratingtwo After last update i am not able to download photos that attached in assignments when i use the iPad version
len ratingfour Chats don t update since last update 
len ratingfour It used to say New message and you would swipe up to refresh and message would appear 
len ratingfour I know have to get out of the Chat and go back in 
len ratingfour P I T A 
len ratingfour Otherwise app is pretty good 
len ratingfour Need the ability to search by 
len ratingthree I literally was using the restroom and it made me join a call out of nowhere without my knowledge 
len ratingthree I had to delete it off of my phone to prevent this from happening 
len ratingthree I wish it would notify me via notification instead of call 
len ratingfour I have been using Microsoft Teams for a couple of months now and I love it 
len ratingfour I manage a group of staff members and when we had to shelter in place we worked remotely 
len ratingfour I initially just communicated by text phone email and video conferencing 
len ratingfour I was all over the place 
len ratingfour Teams has helped me to stay organized track people s work and start conversations as a group without clogging up our text inboxes 
len ratingfour It has helped us as a group to work alongside one another meet with ease and share files in a collective place 
len ratingfour It was fairly easy to learn 
len ratingone It s way to laggy
len ratingfive My thing is a glitch my video my presenting is glitching and everything is freezing
len ratingfive Perfect for Work 
len ratingfive You should be able to contact anyone in your agency at a click of a finger 
len ratingfive It allows you to schedule meetings easy 
len ratingfive Those are my favorite options but Teams help out in so many ways 
len ratingfive Excellent way to communicate with coworkers during difficult times
len ratingfive This is the best app for school I love it so much 
len ratingfive This app is not to be sending people pic or to talk to people this app is only for idea students just so u know
len ratingthree I don t love the way it s written 
len ratingthree It s not intuitive enough 
len ratingthree I have to spend too much time figuring it out and I don t feel confident that I know all that it can do 
len ratingthree I do appreciate that learning videos are available but I either don t have time to watch them or I m too tired from working 
len ratingtwo It is so glitchy and it takes hour for the class to end and boring
len ratingfive Basically the same app but I was introduced to it by my job 
len ratingfive Honestly it s a discord for adults and business people professionals 
len ratingone  Keeps kicking me off when I m meeting with my class for school
len ratingone It Always freezes on me every time i try to get on the app and i get frustrated that ill be late for class
len ratingone Good but needs more improvement
len ratingone  Just hate school 
len ratingtwo I am an educator and as of last week the app has been broken on my device 
len ratingtwo I have not been able to use my iPad at all during my lessons 
len ratingtwo The app freezes as soon as I attempt to do anything 
len ratingtwo Prior to that it was working great even better than the desktop app 
len ratingfour Sometimes disconnects and reopen
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Lol I m a th grade student and I love it just add a little more color
len ratingone I can t find the delete option for old calls and texts messages 
len ratingone Please fix this and make a limit to how many times a person spam calls you Teams because it s annoying 
len ratingone I don t want this app to take up my iPhone s storage space 
len ratingone Add a delete option and I ll give it five stars I promise 
len ratingthree  This app was working excellently for me previously I used to be able to switch between apps while still being able to listen to the meeting and i could also switch off my ipad to save battery life and still be in the meeting 
len ratingthree But i don t know if there s been a new update or it s a glitch or something but the app immediately shuts off when i try to switch apps or close my ipad 
len ratingthree It s very inconvenient if there s been an update my suggestion is to bring back that feature 
len ratingthree I like it but I can t change my background even though I updated teams 
len ratingone This is such a bad app because it alway glitches and kicks me out of my meeting and it gets annoying also there is no icon for the video and audio call button in the personal chat I updated reseted my settings deleted the app and did every single update and it still doesn t work properly and doesn t have the video and audio icons in the personal chat 
len ratingone So just fix this issue PLEASE 
len ratingone This takes all the WiFi in the house 
len ratingone It s also very complicated 
len ratingone Very low quality mics are not recommended 
len ratingone Rate this app low so discoed will be the new king 
len ratingthree  Honestly tho what would we do without it 
len ratingthree Overall the app is great 
len ratingthree It works well and helps keep you connected to you work 
len ratingthree However I would like the option to be offline where people can t message me because even if you re out of office or away there is no true way to disconnect without it looking like you re ignoring people 
len ratingfive  good
len ratingone It crashes
len ratingfour Teams app cannot activate authenticator 
len ratingfive My productivity tool shed is now complete 
len ratingfive Intuitive and easy to use 
len ratingfive Meets all my requirements 
len ratingfive You guys did it 
len ratingfive Keep the good work 
len ratingfive Sad life
len ratingone No
len ratingfive Microsoft teams is a great app to use especially when you re trying to communicate clearly to others and it allows while Microsoft teams is a great app to use especially when you re trying to communicate clearly to others and allows you to share your screen to help others all in all a good app
len ratingthree It s really good and and actually amazing 
len ratingthree I wish the chat feature which is really good can be better and more fluid like emails that are received in outlook and composing a chat is like composing an email Because sometimes if you have multiple chats going at once I feel it s easy to respond to the wrong chat 
len ratingthree I don t like the typing bubbles that shows up when someone is relying typing to a message 
len ratingthree It gives me anxiety seeing those typing bubbles 
len ratingthree I don t like them 
len ratingthree I m sometimes who is a professional but also struggles with dyslexia so the bubbles don t make people like me feel so good 
len ratingthree The type new message are needs to be bigger and when the user hits enter on the keyboard I wish it when to the next line instead of sending the message 
len ratingthree TEAMS is a great tool and it s the future but it must be more user friendly 
len ratingone Terriable on battery life drains your battery almost faster than you can charge 
len ratingfour Can improve areas like finding meeting call chat history when connected with mobile and switching to pc not finding the on going call if not meeting Apart from that everything is good as I used 
len ratingfive Great app for work with a usable dark theme
len ratingthree Everything works fine 
len ratingthree I just really want them to implement CarPlay on the app 
len ratingthree It s been a long time since the original suggestion on their forums 
len ratingfive I ave found teams to be a great support and valuable tool for our creative design processes 
len ratingfive It is easy to use efficient and fosters a high level of collaboration 
len ratingfive We work on complex mixed use buildings melding hotels with residential retail office and parking 
len ratingfive Each use has a distinct grid serious service issues separation of users and complex interdependencies and teams allows us to work through these as a team with great results 
len ratingfive I highly recommend teams 
len ratingfive Best collaboration tool 
len ratingfive Teams is better in the voice video quality compared to Skype
len ratingfive Makes working on the go simple 
len ratingfive Always getting updates 
len ratingfive Bug reported get handle fast 
len ratingfive Everything I need for work is connected 
len ratingfive Life is easy with this tool 
len ratingfour  It s starting to not let people join meeting and the mics are getting muted when the mic is on so no one can talk 
len ratingfour Everyone s thing is reset
len ratingone I don t really understand why this is needed it feels very wired and strange 
len ratingone I hate it
len ratingfour I wish there was an option to privately chat with individual people like zoom but it s overall a good app 
len ratingfive  good but it gives me way too much stress 
len ratingfive best app for professionals
len ratingfive Great for collaboration with this COVID 
len ratingfive Saved many companies and kept businesses and innovations going 
len ratingfive The app is an excellent stable platform 
len ratingfive It would be excellent to have the ability to share calendars between specific people or teams by default 
len ratingfive Also it would be beneficial to have a link between calendar and tasks 
len ratingone  My son Harry Potter said he couldn t do the proper hokis pokis spell parents plz help out email me on Karen Com ayyyy
len ratingfive Simple interface great quality 
len ratingfive Love the product 
len ratingone Well If The Teachers Couldn t See What The Student Do On Privet Chat Or Control Chats I Would Like More The App 
len ratingfive I ve been a teams phone user for quite sometime now 
len ratingfive I use it not only for virtual meetings with clients and employees but also as a complete in the cloud VOIP system with a phone number attached that I can dial out with 
len ratingfive I do wish the phone dialer was easier to access as it takes a couple of taps to get to 
len ratingfour Merging two incoming call Continuing an ongoing call on another device 
len ratingfour For example start on PC then go on Mobile 
len ratingfour  We have that option if a meeting was setup but not a love call Lost a feature that was good Favorite Chat contacts Adding external users to calls a lot easier
len ratingfive When the pandemic started and when the distance learning started my school used this app and don t get me wrong it s amazing for school 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and it s the only way I can keep in touch with my friends so anyway get this app 
len ratingfive Great way to stay connected with coworkers and family 
len ratingfive Use it daily 
len ratingfour I love the app but sometimes it get glitchy so please work on the bugs 
len ratingfour I love how it is built for classrooms 
len ratingfour I would add features like maybe private chatting a person if you need to ask the teacher something 
len ratingfour Or maybe new reactions 
len ratingfour I love the app though 
len ratingone every time i try to open the app it just closes immediately 
len ratingone i can t join any of my meetings for school
len ratingfour The app is useful but I don t want teams calls showing up on my recent calls list on my personal phone 
len ratingfour They should occur through the app only so I don t pocket dial my coworkers 
len ratingfour Or if you can toggle the merge on and off 
len ratingfour Any solution would be appreciated
len ratingone I don t like it because it is lagging
len ratingfive I study in this app Microsoft teams app i like it I mean I hate it because the moe shut down the chat and now I can t talk with my bestie 
len ratingone Even running their Mac version software
len ratingthree This app is great for team calls but sometimes I have long calls 
len ratingthree I m not always required to have my camera on 
len ratingthree I just don t like that I can t close my phone without leaving the call 
len ratingthree I also keep getting kicked out of certain calls sometimes 
len ratingthree Besides that the app is pretty good 
len ratingthree I hope there s an update when I get off the app and small version of the call is still at the corner of the screen 
len ratingone  So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So badSo bad So bad So bad So bad So bad So bad
len ratingfive It s pretty user friendly 
len ratingfive Allows collaboration 
len ratingfive I love the ability to add notes and attachments
len ratingone I don t want to do school give the a bad rating get it off of the AppStore please so I don t have to do school 
len ratingthree It doesn t provide a raise the hand button for me and the quality is not the best 
len ratingone the layout of the app is so bad you always have to download other apps like one note and word in order for the teams apps to properly function 
len ratingone the mic also keeps on randomly unmuting during team calls causing embarrassing moments 
len ratingfive I recently started a new job at an amazing company I was really worried about virtual on boarding and not getting to have a good relationship with my partners 
len ratingfive In the two weeks I ve been on boarding I ve been doing video calls using the chatting function and using Teams to schedule meetings regularly with everybody on my team 
len ratingfive This application is super functional and looks good 
len ratingfive I would recommend any organization get it especially during these Covid times 
len ratingfive  Tom
len ratingthree Calendar can be improved 
len ratingthree Multi week view helps 
len ratingthree I feel teams calendar doesn t have a view like outlook 
len ratingone Like my teacher is asking me to change my profile picture but your system is messed up Microsoft 
len ratingone Fix this problem 
len ratingone It s very annoying to post a review like this 
len ratingfour Collaboration is great Teams meeting is not good at recording attendees The chat function during teams does not always record all attendees logging in Having a record of attendees would be very helpful Screen size function should be easier
len ratingfive Best flattening tool I ve used in a good while 
len ratingone Loaf loaf loaf 
len ratingfive I ve dealt with zoom webex and apps for my sons school 
len ratingfive Teams is far and away the most intuitive and useful program for this purpose 
len ratingfive The video quality is superior and the interaction with the chat is seamless 
len ratingfive Also add in the connectivity with the other Microsoft products like outlook 
len ratingfive There really isn t a competition with these others programs
len ratingfive Thank you and I look forward to more workshops like this one 
len ratingfive  Be safe and Healthy Marty
len ratingone Thanks for making me miss my English class and fubaring my computer 
len ratingone Cingua tu madre 
len ratingone Whenever i scroll through my gallery the entire photo gallery just starts bugging out and vibrating 
len ratingone I ve reset my phone and it s only gotten worse 
len ratingone This is ONLY on your app 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone This is the worst app for learning 
len ratingone I love the app but after if u went through what I went through u would want to punch your phone like ughhhh I just wanna go to class and it won t let me talkin bout some I m offline login to your WiFi like IM LOGGED IN SMH 
len ratingfour It s like the computer app just a bit buggy the reason for stars 
len ratingfive The TEAMS app is very user friendly 
len ratingfive I love the screen sharing option very helpful when staffing cases with co workers 
len ratingfive Hello Microsoft Corperation 
len ratingfive I need to let you know something when there is too many people on it it starts to glitch be sure to update that ok 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Very professional and easy to use 
len ratingone Pee pee poo poo 
len ratingfour The new separate screen feature makes it really difficult to perform screen sharing 
len ratingfive Team s has really increased my Work productivity and has enhanced my digital Life and exceptional collaboration among team members and all across organization and even outside vendors 
len ratingfive Hats off to Microsoft for creation an exceptional Collaboration product called Team s 
len ratingthree I love the app and a majority of the functionality but why doesn t Teams have an additional FaceID setting like microsoft outlook 
len ratingone  Rate this Star I really don t wanna work I wanna watch anime and bakugou katsuki
len ratingfive A true one stop shop for all collaboration activity 
len ratingthree It s fine 
len ratingthree But an e mail i clock on in the iOS Outlook app shouldn t pass me through Safari to ask me if I want to open the announcement or comment I d chosen in Outlook in Teams 
len ratingthree That s a waste of time 
len ratingone bad
len ratingone  I hate this app it s always kicking me out crashing being soooo slow speech gets disoriented and my teach disabled the chat the then turned it back on and several people still can t do it 
len ratingone One of the calls we couldn t even do 
len ratingone And when I went to music a music class that was canceled was still there so I was stuck in the wrong meeting for minutes 
len ratingone Then the correct meeting comes on finally but I get kicked out times in a row 
len ratingone And there s only minutes of music left 
len ratingone So now I m considered basically absent to music 
len ratingone I HATE teams it deserves stars 
len ratingone Zoom is better 
len ratingone  percent of the stars are probably fake 
len ratingone BTW fix your problems 
len ratingone It s soooooo bad tho
len ratingfive It s definitely the future in good hands 
len ratingfive Okay so basically I can t see the meeting that is going on still a great app though 
len ratingfive Just please fix this bug 
len ratingfive Very ergonomic 
len ratingthree Its a good app but it definitely could use custom backgrounds for ipad
len ratingone We re using Teams for virtual learning and it has proven to be unreliable 
len ratingone She misses every other scheduled meeting 
len ratingone It has bad quality and it glitches and it sends me out of the meeting and I can t even get into the app
len ratingone Worst app I have ever used
len ratingfour Sometimes messages aren t sent delivered in a timely manner 
len ratingfour Otherwise great app 
len ratingfive This app seems to work pretty seamlessly with my laptop app 
len ratingfive I m very happy with the usage so far 
len ratingone It wasn t what I hoped
len ratingfive I like cheese
len ratingfour Would love to give stars 
len ratingfour Features like reply and forward would great option and makes life easy 
len ratingfour Reply feature on the message that is available on mobile app should be enabled for desktop 
len ratingfour One other feature I would like to have is screen capture feature like the one on jabber 
len ratingfive I was not happy when I learned we were moving to Teams in my company 
len ratingfive I don t like change of any kind for the first days 
len ratingfive I reluctantly attended the initial training class on how to use Teams rolling my eyes thinking I will never figure this out It s been six months and I m a huge fan 
len ratingfive I can t live without it 
len ratingfive I use it on my laptop and I have the app 
len ratingfive I ve ventured out to learn more about all the other options on surveys and forms but am still learning 
len ratingfive It took me about a day to figure out chat and navigate participate comfortably in a chat 
len ratingfive It took me hours to learn how to successfully present a presentation and share screen w co workers 
len ratingfive It took less than min to set up my own Teams channel 
len ratingfive Forms and other apps are taking a bit longer 
len ratingone  How come Teams doesn t work when close to the internet box 
len ratingone  It was the only way to chat to my best friend I would be happy if u added it back
len ratingfive I like Teams a lot 
len ratingfive It s been great being able to share my screen with coworkers 
len ratingfive Just a question how do you permanently delete a chat when you re done with the topic 
len ratingfive It seems like the chats are always there 
len ratingfive It would be nice to be able to delete them 
len ratingfour please let us mirror our video on microsoft teams 
len ratingone Sometimes I ll turn in an assignment and it tells me that i turned it in and then I ll go back and it says i haven t done it
len ratingfive Really helps leadership and teams stay in sync 
len ratingfive Growth is inevitable withTeams 
len ratingone As someone who has used Slack and now Teams Slack is by and far the better platform 
len ratingone Easier interface less bugs and error better connectivity 
len ratingone My company is already looking to switch back to Slack in 
len ratingtwo it doesn t work
len ratingone  I hate school 
len ratingthree Teams is consistently updating it s list of integrations to offer 
len ratingthree I want to use Teams for all of my biz communication 
len ratingthree The devs are figuring out how to notify me when I m using a platform that can be integrated in real time 
len ratingthree The platform is missing a specific funneling cadence for tracking and forecasting progression but I m certain that s due to growing pains 
len ratingthree The mobile app could be more IOS friendly but the tech lagging is understandable considering the source 
len ratingthree Overall the devs deserve a round of applause 
len ratingthree It s a terrific platform for optimizing multiple communication methods like emails CRM s and clouds management 
len ratingthree As it continues to mature I m expecting this platform to integrate an optimized AI mix and pivot into more of a Personal Assistant for customers 
len ratingthree If I m in the ballpark with my review and Teams is close to implementing a GTM product with the following milestones it could soon become an everyday app for me Adapts to my current Work from Home lifestyle with a Personalized Assistant 
len ratingthree  Optimizes my Work Life balance streamlining all of my online activity with personalized suggestions 
len ratingthree  Secures monitors and protects my IP PI database consistently with an All In Security Assistant 
len ratingthree  You guys need to make system default an option for dark mode cause I work during the night sometimes in the dark you know the vibes and im tired of having to close my app just to switch it
len ratingone  No
len ratingtwo When I work on this ITS VERY GLITCHY I DIDNT LIKE THAT PLS FIX IT 
len ratingone  I hate this app it s always kicking me out crashing being soooo slow speech gets disoriented and my teach disabled the chat the then turned it back on and several people still can t do it 
len ratingone One of the calls we couldn t even do 
len ratingone And when I went to music a music class that was canceled was still there so I was stuck in the wrong meeting for minutes 
len ratingone Then the correct meeting comes on finally but I get kicked out times in a row 
len ratingone And there s only minutes of music left 
len ratingone So now I m considered basically absent to music 
len ratingone I HATE teams it deserves stars 
len ratingone Zoom is better 
len ratingone I like this app it s very easy to understand and it s easy to contact your teacher but when you join a call it messes up my thing glitches and I either can hear or I can t see or can t turn on my mic 
len ratingone Sometimes it won t even tell me I suppose to be in a call 
len ratingfive Great way to connect and do training with our soldiers during this time of uncertainty 
len ratingfive I m an IT guy and as soon as we did the transition from Skype to Teams it was literally night and day 
len ratingfive Such an easy app to use and works exactly like the desktop one
len ratingthree It works well 
len ratingthree But needs to make notifications for calendar events and ability to continue a call when the device is locked and screen off 
len ratingfive I enjoy the app on my phone 
len ratingfive It allows me to stay connected to my team mates when I m away from the office and when I m having tech issues I can still connect with them from my cell phone 
len ratingfive It s the same as using the app on a desktop 
len ratingone I m just trying to do school but this app keeps glitching
len ratingone No
len ratingfive I literally live all of my work life on Teams 
len ratingfive Love the multichannel accessibility that allows me to switch between my laptop and my phone with great ease 
len ratingfive  Teams is super useful quick and easy I use it especially in the time of pandemic and is very useful to communicate with team members so we all are updated quickly and effectively 
len ratingfive Cheers Microsoft Teams
len ratingthree Teams works fine 
len ratingthree The built in calendar and chat works great 
len ratingthree But it really needs an annotation tool for team projects 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone This app VERY BAD NOT GOOD no notifications
len ratingone yeah no 
len ratingone Poo poo
len ratingfive Excellent tool for keeping up with business 
len ratingfive Invaluable for companies that take productivity seriously 
len ratingfive Become a solution provider 
len ratingfive Get Teams 
len ratingfour Wish you could delete chat but the rest is great
len ratingtwo When you search for a specific word or sentence you can t see the entire conversation on the right 
len ratingtwo That totally lost the searching purpose 
len ratingfive This app I rate a because of how orginazied and they way its build
len ratingone It s not letting me text my friends
len ratingone why would my chats get disabled how am i supposed to get on my calls now why is that feature even there tf give me my access back
len ratingfive We use this to communicate
len ratingfour  It happens often where i go to my assignments tab and nothing pops up it just stays on a blank screen 
len ratingfour It is very frustrating and annoying when a teacher is trying to explain an assignment to me and when i go to look for it none of my assignments classes show up at all 
len ratingfour The only way i am able to fix this is to completely close the app then open it back again 
len ratingfour There are also other small glitches that are similar to this where the only way i can fix it is to close the app 
len ratingfour As helpful and organized this app is please Microsoft look into the small glitches because they are very counterproductive 
len ratingfive This app makes Zoom look like crap 
len ratingfive This has truly the best features and capabilities 
len ratingfive cool App
len ratingfive See title
len ratingfive As a company we have replaced jabber with Microsoft Teams
len ratingone i dont like school 
len ratingfour Wish you could copy and paste from oneNote 
len ratingfour Other than that good collaboration tool
len ratingfive Keeping connected amp informed is so important
len ratingfour I love the Teams app but it isn t very work friendly when you re in meetings 
len ratingfour If I m attending a meeting or watching a presentation my status will move to an Away status 
len ratingfour Since I work from home it s imperative that my leaders know I m online this makes me seem as if I m away even when I m at my computer working 
len ratingfour It also forms t connect with my Outlook very well as it pertains to WebEx or other webinars I attend it ll stall say away 
len ratingfour If you all can fix that this is a perfect app 
len ratingthree I have predictive text on my iPhone already 
len ratingthree Don t need it twice 
len ratingthree I am accidentally fat fingering those new little buttons when trying to type a message and it is really an issue 
len ratingthree I generally love the teams app but can t be sending accidental messages to my coworkers 
len ratingfour I love the app for school but it s really glitchy and when I m on a call it freezes and I have good WiFi at my house and I use my iPad witch I got years ago and it s still working fine it s just I had homework and I don t know what I have for homework anymore and now I think I m gonna get an f but all I m saying is that there might be a glitch in the app or something but that s all
len ratingone I didn t like this app at all I use this app for school and most of my classes got hacked by a random person 
len ratingone It was very inappropriate and since this is used for school and work so I expected the security to be better but I guess not 
len ratingfive How can i buy tickets and watch the lakers game virtually
len ratingone  Download the app for a better experience but I downloaded it to my tablet and it doesn t work as well as the online version when 
len ratingone Settings are so confusing 
len ratingone I can t never figure out how to change display name during meeting 
len ratingone During an important meeting I spent most of the hour trying to figure out how to mute the chat since it keeps beeping every time someone types a message 
len ratingone It says log in to your Microsoft account to change settings so I go online to Microsoft sign in and enter my work email and it reads this account doesn t exist even though that s the one I use to log in to all microsoft apps 
len ratingone Also sometimes I can see myself in a small screen on the corner sometimes I can t sometimes I can see everyone sometimes I can t 
len ratingone Randomly I see to screens and I have to choose which one to close 
len ratingone Frustrating 
len ratingone  delete the app online school is tiring me luv 
len ratingone I use Teams for work and thought it would be great to access on my iPad 
len ratingone Unfortunately though the app launched and allowed me to login it would not respond to any taps after that 
len ratingone I tried deleting and reinstalling restarting my iPad all to no avail 
len ratingone I m disappointed that this app for me turned out to be utterly useless 
len ratingone It works perfectly good when it works I ve tried using it multiple times as this is the way my child s school chooses to do our meetings and that ONE time I was able to connect it worked wonderful never been able to connect again it kicks me out in a split second if I get lucky enough to join a meeting never had a problem with Zoom 
len ratingone The real downside is I have missed very important meetings and it s very frustrating
len ratingfive Oof on the quality but overall great App
len ratingfour Is is possible to change the use of the word Owner to Editor which best explains the role 
len ratingfour Besides the colonial connotations of the word Owner the word editor is most commonly understood and makes the most sense as nobody owns the platform we use at work 
len ratingone It s OK but it needs a few repairs my daughter is having trouble logging in because it won t allow guests it says you can but it won t it will not let you win and it s driving me crazy 
len ratingfive Functionality is great 
len ratingfive I can do the main tasks I need to and has come in handy working from home big time 
len ratingthree So do online school and my teacher tell us to use curtain apps and I download the apps but I m still in the meeting call but then I go out the app but like I said I m still in the call then when I go the app I just downloaded I get kicked out of the meeting call immediately and it is very annoying so I give this app a three
len ratingfive Teams is a good app but sometimes it loses control Anyways cheers for teams
len ratingfour The functionality of the app is spot on 
len ratingfour Would give it stars if it didn t drain my battery so much 
len ratingfive Best Office Ucaas application 
len ratingone I have had nothing but issues with this app since downloading it 
len ratingone Trying to use it to stay connected with my residents in my dorm hall has been a NIGHTMARE 
len ratingthree With Skype and other applications we could allow multiple people manage recurrent meetings during absences from work 
len ratingthree This should be enabled for teams 
len ratingfive Best MicroSoft program ever 
len ratingfive Seem less versatility 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone It doesn t work sometimes and I can t join a important call 
len ratingfive Excellent tool to get in touch with your co workers and share files 
len ratingfour First bug logs you out every few days which is no lt a problem but it pretends you re still logged in and doesn t prompt you to log in either 
len ratingfour You re rocking along waiting on communication that will never come until you try to send a message and it still pretends you re logged in until the message fails 
len ratingfour Then and only then as far as I can see does it prompt you to log in 
len ratingfour Then you re fine for next few days 
len ratingfour Second perhaps this is not a bug but a wish item I d like to be able to share my screen from iPad Pro 
len ratingfour No way to do that 
len ratingfour Third the Share Screen is not a uniform icon placement across the Mac Windows or iOS apps 
len ratingfour When you re telling someone where the share screen icon is and what it looks like well unless they have your same OS it s not gonna make sense to them 
len ratingfour After you figure out the quirks this is a highly functional very handy app 
len ratingfour It s really incredible for all that it does do 
len ratingfour Sorry my review only seems to list the few but major complaints I had 
len ratingone this is the reason i have school bill gates is daddy btw 
len ratingfive This app does a great job of taking the teams functionality over to mobile devices 
len ratingfive Basically all the functions you are used to from the web and desktop versions are Incorporated 
len ratingfive Even better than those or can handle multiple teams accounts at once with easy click between 
len ratingfive This means that for anyone using teams with multiple employers or organisations this app is a must 
len ratingthree I use this app for school and I love it 
len ratingthree Especially since it s allowed me to go to school virtually 
len ratingthree The one thing that I absolutely hate though is the Assignments tab 
len ratingthree Instead of seeing a list of my assignments like it used to be I have to click on each individual classes tab in order to figure out if I have any assignments 
len ratingfive Every time I exit the and open the app again while in a meeting it randomly kicks me out of the meeting or it gets me trapped in the chat area Dear Microsoft please fix this Thank you
len ratingfive App works as expected and have not had any issues with being able to use it 
len ratingone ruined my life
len ratingone Performs just like you would expect a Microsoft product that you need to work works 
len ratingone Freezes 
len ratingone Doesn t load 
len ratingone Meetings never open 
len ratingone Get WebEx if you need a meeting app 
len ratingfive So convenient and easy to attend meetings
len ratingthree Would like a setting that you can set your availability to show you are still available even though you may or may not have been in Teams 
len ratingfour Hi first of all I would like to thank you for this great app it is amazing and helps a lot and presenting and meeting with my team daily thing I would request to enhance since I work with three monitors minimum with two is to have that capability is on one monitor will have the video feed of the participant and the second monitor I can see the presentation as a handle many teams that option will be very viableAnd will accomplish two points one is to see everyones attentiveness and the other to monitor the presentation thank you very much and hope this can be added as a feature
len ratingfour Need to be able do polling without the audience seeing the outcome results 
len ratingone This app is so laggy it s so glitchy and there is literally nothing to say about it except I HATE IT SO MUCH 
len ratingone I really am not trying to be mean but this is so glitchy so laggy and it never works 
len ratingone My daughter had to go to the office because she couldn t log on class but actually he thought that we didn t want to log on 
len ratingone THANKS ALOT TEAMS 
len ratingone This app is utterly useless and an annoying obstacle to my education 
len ratingone I despise it as much as I despise my worst enemies 
len ratingfive Nice work Microsoft 
len ratingthree The app allows you attend meetings while being mobile however I don t like having to sign in again before attending the meeting 
len ratingthree Most times the app doesn t notify you until multiple times of trying to join the meeting which ultimately can make you late if you waited to the last minute to sign in 
len ratingthree All the rest seems good except how to get to the iPhone speaker phone since it s automatically on the regular phone speaker 
len ratingfive This app is a great way to stay connected with your DCP team and supervisor 
len ratingfive It s a perfect way to see who is active on the site as the app auto populates every time you log on to your computer and shows a active status 
len ratingfive This app is also a great way to chat with co workers and share ideas and information 
len ratingfive  years of service and counting CPS Walker A 
len ratingone I have reinstalled TEAMS twice but it continues to shut down as soon as I log in 
len ratingone This just started a few days ago 
len ratingone As an educator I rely on TEAMS to interact with students and staff 
len ratingone Please help 
len ratingfive Since working remotely Microsoft Teams has been an invaluable resource for our team 
len ratingfive I love that you can answer teams calls view screen share etc from the app just as you would on a computer 
len ratingfive This has allowed a great amount of flexibility for members of my team 
len ratingone  This app is horrible it has so many issues for me it turns off my phone the mic doesn t ever work and I can t connect
len ratingfive Great work well for our need 
len ratingfive Communicating through the day 
len ratingfive Application unexpected close 
len ratingone BAD
len ratingone It keeps kicking me out I can t even log in I need it for school and I can t even use it 
len ratingone I don t like this app but I ll tell ya who does my dad i don t really like it because I m just a teen and I think it s boring but my dad needs this for his work company JTI this is my dads phone but I need my dads phone because I have a special game on hear so I can text my friends but on my phone it does not let me get that special I mean app not game so where was I 
len ratingone oh yes so my phone did not let me get that app so I use it the next day I wanted to delete this app but then I thought but my dad needs this appro make money for me so I did not delete it and that s it end of story
len ratingfive Team is great tool to speed up your work Super keep it up 
len ratingfour Everything syncs and it s a seem less transition 
len ratingfour ONE exception the Quiet Hours only works for messages and notifications it does NOT silence calls 
len ratingfour Teams needs to fix that 
len ratingone THIS APP IS GARBAGE 
len ratingone It never works correctly and is always glitching 
len ratingone If you were thinking of using this app for school FIND A DIFFERENT ONE 
len ratingone This app never works and is made terribly very hard to navigate and is NOT user friendly 
len ratingone Terrible app do not waste ur time on this trash 
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingfive Enables me to always be in touch with my team 
len ratingone This app is so hard to use 
len ratingone honestly I liked google classroom better
len ratingone  And has been occurring for a month devs are sleeping or something 
len ratingfour Wish I could view excel sheets and chat simultaneously
len ratingone Doesn t work
len ratingfive When they first launched Teams at work I was hesitant and honestly it was another app that I had to log into 
len ratingfive Once Covid hit and everyone had to use the platform it is such a lifesaver 
len ratingfive Now I only wish I had email incorporated so I don t have to look at outlook anymore 
len ratingfive Great job development team 
len ratingone As soon as I open the app it immediately shuts down 
len ratingone I can see I have messages with students but I can t get to them on my iphone 
len ratingone When I tried using teams to do my online work everything just completely erased and all my passwords had been now all my progress got school is now all gone 
len ratingfive I feel like the app version works just as well as the windows desktop version 
len ratingfive No complaints from me 
len ratingfive I love it it s so cool 
len ratingone I hate this app I hate all my teachers even tho I don t know them 
len ratingone I hate school sm 
len ratingone Images take TOO MUCH to load it needs a lot of development and i have had mental breakdowns just bc of this app
len ratingone Read reviews doesn t work on iPhone
len ratingone Por favor no quiero cojer clases virtuales elim nenla 
len ratingfour Hi 
len ratingfour Because of the pandemic I m taking classes online 
len ratingfour I only have one issue and really it s more of a preference 
len ratingfour It would help me out if the assignments tab just showed you the assignments you need to do 
len ratingfour I d rather not go through every channel to see if I ve got assignments to do 
len ratingfour Also if all the assignments were listed in one place it d be easy to return to that page afterwards 
len ratingfour It would make doing my assignments fun if they disappeared from the list once I turned them in 
len ratingfour Like mission accomplished quest completed 
len ratingfour That kinda format 
len ratingfour I m not a great student so I m not on top on what I need to do and for what class I need to do it for

len ratingtwo Teams kept dropping my audio today 
len ratingtwo Not sure if that was a Teams issue or the host s laptop 
len ratingtwo I only know it was the most frustrating meeting I ve attended in recent years 
len ratingone  I hate school
len ratingfour Overall good but sound quality could be a little better 
len ratingone I downloaded teams because that s what my school is using for classes this year so I liked the idea of having quick access on my phone 
len ratingone Everytime I open the app however it crashes and closes almost immediately 
len ratingone I have an iPhone update 
len ratingone I have work to do for school 
len ratingone My school laptop is slow meaning I need to use this app

len ratingone Fix this 
len ratingone App crashes as soon as you open it 
len ratingone Useless 
len ratingone Please fix this Microsoft 
len ratingthree Don t get me wrong the app is very useful and functional but it still lacks some features when compared to the desktop app 
len ratingthree Now you guys DO know that an iPad Pro processor can handle a lot more 
len ratingthree Some of us don t want to use a computer to start a meeting or schedule them 
len ratingthree I d like to be able to do so from my iPad 
len ratingthree Please consider adding these features

len ratingthree Tried restarting and removing and reinstalling the app with same results 
len ratingthree It did work well before the update 
len ratingfive My employer has been stuck in the Outlook and generic Skype world for years 
len ratingfive Teams and the Microsoft suite are maki g us more collaborative and dare I say happier individuals as much as a program can make you happy when you used to use a rock and chisel
len ratingfive Teams is a good product and the app is well designed 
len ratingfive Allows me to be fully connected and engaged on the go 
len ratingfive No fumbling with links or dial in codes 
len ratingfive One tap and I m in the meeting 
len ratingfive The issue I have is dealing with customers and clients when dealing with commercial and gov versions of office 
len ratingfive That can get a little tricky 
len ratingone MS Teams keeps crashing upon opening before I can read anything both on my iPhone Plus iOS and on my iPad Air iOS 
len ratingone Our school will be relying on this and we can t use it 
len ratingone Bad 
len ratingone After latest update can no longer log in when Duo is enabled on a work account

len ratingfour Teams is great

len ratingone It s crap
len ratingfive Great way to stay connected 
len ratingfive Fast alerts so you are not waiting for someone to reply to an email 
len ratingthree If I forget to swipe away the app when it s backgrounders it s guaranteed to drain my battery 
len ratingthree Very frustrating to suddenly find my phone half dead because Teams is running in the background doing who knows what 
len ratingfive I am using this app right now for school and it s good but I just wanted to see if I could get help with the app because every time I press the app to get in it instantly kicks me out like the ordinary bug just wanted to see if it was only me or not 
len ratingone Used to work but yesterday it started crashing every time I open it 
len ratingone Uninstall and reinstall doesn t help 
len ratingfour Use it for meetings

len ratingtwo Pathetic 
len ratingone  Borren la aplicaci n porque hacen aplicaciones para estudiar no quiero
len ratingfive No complaints here 
len ratingfive Normally use Teams on my Mac but the iOS App sure is handy while I m away from my desk 
len ratingfour One thing to fix can I access and share files while Teams videoconferencing 
len ratingfour That will help immensely 
len ratingone Constantly crashing 
len ratingone I can t even get the app to stay open for a moment 
len ratingone Very upset 
len ratingfive  It is just simple and easy
len ratingfour No option to do full screen during meetings
len ratingthree It may be out IT but Teams isn t as fully integrated with Outlook as Skype is for contacts
len ratingfive MS Teams has proved to be an amazing tool during COVID 
len ratingfive I use it daily 
len ratingone Not a good app google classroom is better why tf did my school make us do this
len ratingfive Teams is the best conferencing app in the market right now 
len ratingfive Zoom s got nothing on it 
len ratingfive My friend and writing coauthor told me today Teams is the best collaborative tool he has ever used 
len ratingfive I think it s really good but I deleted it a while ago because I thought we were gonna go back to regular school but we aren t so I downloaded it today and it keeps like kicking me out of the app also I start school next week so I would love if you could tell me why that s happening or if you could fix it thanks for reading
len ratingfour It has some bugs will bing on my phone even though I am working on the computer the settings say it isn t supposed to do that 
len ratingfour Sometimes I try to answer a call and it goes to message after rings and I can t figure out how to fix that because other times itwill ring and ring 
len ratingone When I m in a meeting the chat freezes and it gets all chaotic
len ratingfive Please enable the option to send and receive SMS Texts via Teams 
len ratingfour I hope you develop the app so we can take meeting attendance in excel every time i need to do that i must use a computer 
len ratingthree So the desktop app version works just fine but the app on my phone doesn t 
len ratingthree Every time I open the app it closes automatically 
len ratingthree I ve only had the app for five days it worked fine the first four but today it starting being glitchy 
len ratingthree Kind of annoying since this is now what I have to use to teach my virtual students 
len ratingone  I used to love this app 
len ratingone Our school used Teams for remote learning after spring break 
len ratingone It worked pretty well at that time 
len ratingone Today I was trying to check my groups for the new school year 
len ratingone But it keeps crashing 
len ratingone I deleted the app and downloaded it again but it still doesn t work so I restart my phone 
len ratingone It worked a few minutes and then it died again 
len ratingone I don t know if it s my phone s problem or the app s 
len ratingone I updated my software to iOS last night 
len ratingone Is there anything to do with the update 
len ratingone IT KEEPS CRASHING EVERYTIME I OPEN THE APP
len ratingone App will not work crashes immediately after opening 
len ratingfive Absolutely tremendous platform 
len ratingfive Enabling success and communication 
len ratingfive Great for work from home and work on the go 
len ratingtwo I don t know if it is just my phone but the app needs to be fixed
len ratingthree Can not admit people into rooms from the iPhone app 
len ratingthree This has become very problematic 
len ratingfour In the beginning there were no problems with feedback noise I have been using it since March 
len ratingfour Over the last couple of weeks there has been several different noises within our meeting 
len ratingfour Feedback noise when others are talking echo and a loud noise sound like a buzz 
len ratingfour Not able to stop the noise when ending call and starting over had to wait until it stopped on its own 
len ratingfour Feedback noise was for an entire meeting which made it hard to understand and hear 
len ratingfour Literally read her lips while she was speaking 
len ratingfour Outside of that it s easy to use and I like being able to share my screen record meetings and use the chat 
len ratingfive  Very good 
len ratingfive Really this app deserves stars 
len ratingfive Very good app I have installed both in my IPad and computer 
len ratingfive It has many features like you can add background effects in your background share your screen record the call add subtitles and invite participants and even guests 
len ratingfive In chat you can not only write messages but edit it like a champ 
len ratingfive You can post in multiple groups not allow people to reply and much more 
len ratingfive You can also attach files and give praises and create a poll 
len ratingfive in files column you can upload files make folders download them sync them you can also make assignments and give grades 
len ratingfive and the new features just made me drive off 
len ratingfive The opening in new windows and together mode raise hand and quick meet option are just great 
len ratingfive I don t know why the foolish people are disliking this app but I like it very very very very very very very very much 
len ratingtwo Tablet don t support meeting recording 
len ratingone Does not work with iOS on iPhone X 
len ratingone Every time I open it it immediately closes 
len ratingone It worked before update to iOS 
len ratingone i m giving a bc y all ain t letting me change my pfp 
len ratingfour For the most part MS Teams is a great application with lots of features 
len ratingfour However I have two complaints 
len ratingfour  Unlike it desktop version you don t have custom background calls for meetings 
len ratingfour  When in you in the chat overview window it doesn t report the person correct status until you into that chat session 
len ratingfour  There is no car play support 
len ratingfour That second point is very annoying since you have to go into each chat session to get updated statuses 
len ratingone I have Microsoft accounts one for me and one for my children which I have had since originally opened on a desktop computer 
len ratingone These accounts use my phone number for verification 
len ratingone Today I download the Teams app to my iPhone and login using my one phone number 
len ratingone The app sends a verification code I add code hit continue then I receive an error message about my phone number saying to use a different phone number that my phone number is already used 
len ratingone I just received the code through that phone number 
len ratingone Therefore I can not move on 
len ratingone I could not use the app 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone I also have OneDrive app on same phone and didn t have any problem signing onto both Microsoft accounts one at a time through phone 
len ratingone I am very disappointed 
len ratingfive The only thing we need is to replace ZOOM with whatever Microsoft Teams has and this would Rock 
len ratingfive It s okay app to socialize
len ratingfour App works perfectly in every way EXCEPT no support for iOS MacOS text shortcuts and NO SUPPORT for OFFICE AUTOCORRECT 
len ratingfour Makes chat excruciating in comparison to Slack
len ratingfour I use this app for work video meetings and it is great 
len ratingfour My only issue is that it constantly will switch the mic to mute randomly and cause a lot of confusion 
len ratingfour This happens to everyone in my meetings so I know it s not just me 
len ratingfive This app is very useful 
len ratingfive I work in IT and this allows our group to communicate with each other and collaborate on issues 
len ratingfive It s a great tool for any team especially given our current climate 
len ratingone Doesn t work on Linux this teams app is just Skype but worse 
len ratingone No dial in numbers 
len ratingone All frustration 
len ratingone Thanks Microsoft 
len ratingfour Efficient and makes communication smooth in the cloud 
len ratingfive  a va bien
len ratingone Way too much going on 
len ratingone Has made simple tasks turn into scavenger hunts 
len ratingone The new teams location services is not working as we have location sharing on on all devices for the family and still not showing location for days at a time 
len ratingone Poor execution 
len ratingone Notifications not working on some of the devices in our chat or status always showing offline 
len ratingfive I love the efficiency 
len ratingfive The best way to get ahold of people in our company 
len ratingfive E mails are for big ideas amp long winded explanations 
len ratingfive Teams Chat gives you a platform to get your points across to important contacts in just a few sentences 
len ratingone For some reason I get notifications saying work is due i don t want to do work please fix
len ratingfive Easy fast way of communication virtually and sharing ideas 
len ratingfive  Very easy to use where I can communicate anywhere with my colleagues
len ratingone  Primero no hay fondo en ipad Segundo las llamadas no sirven el teams dw mu computadora esta lento pero lo demas rapido Tercero cuando entrego algo aparce que no entregue Cuarto es ilegal porque miran chats privados y eso es invasion a la privasidaf Quinto nadamas aparecen personas y no todo el salon Sexto zoom sirve mejor
len ratingfive Much smoother and workable 
len ratingone Couldn t even get into the meeting bc it was always saying the meeting ended and then it said meeting was full 
len ratingone I tried every minute and even waited for the meeting 
len ratingone I also tried on all my device and it still didn t work 
len ratingfour It would be nice to have the option to like or add other responses to messages 
len ratingfour Then I d change my review to stars 
len ratingone Get rid of this app pls it s other app better than this
len ratingfive I ve had a great experience getting familiar with Teams mobile easy to use amp helps keep our group organized 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingthree So I rlly enjoyed teams I always use it ft with my friends but sometimes it lags a little but not much but what I didn t like was that when I want to share my screen sometimes it Doesn t share and other times there s no sound Can u guys pls fix this 
len ratingthree Thx great job with this app btw 
len ratingfive I love working with Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive It has been very reliable with IM and online video meetings 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingfive I work for a government agency and this app has been a lifesaver to communicate with coworkers and have meetings 
len ratingfive It s very user friendly 
len ratingfive It has made working from home a breeze 
len ratingfive Great tool to communicate with co workers
len ratingtwo This would get stars but you can t delete conversations 
len ratingfour The teams app has brought a new level of communication both internally within our company and also with customers and vendors 
len ratingfive Excellent app easy to navigate and has a lot of good options 
len ratingfive They ve even increased the amount of people you can see at one time 
len ratingfive I m glad I switched over 
len ratingfive really smart app 
len ratingthree Pratique
len ratingone The app itself is decent but there are too many technical issues 
len ratingone The app is either offline or crashes anytime I try to use it 
len ratingone It s also very hard to turn in assignments rarely does it when I try 
len ratingone Needs to get worked on more other people I know are having the same issues 
len ratingone And sometimes can t even use the chat 
len ratingone I can t sign up the previous owner of my current cellphone number which I got last year still has my new phone number in his account here 
len ratingone Is there a way where we don t use our cellphone number to register to this app 
len ratingone  Or better is there a way for that person to be informed that he should remove my phone number from his account 
len ratingone  I need to register ASAP I am attending an online convention next week using MS Teams thanks
len ratingfive Very organic and intuitive 
len ratingfive Love the aesthetics too 
len ratingfive Microsoft is the best 
len ratingthree My shifts tab will not populate since the last update 
len ratingone I can t log in and everytime I add a password it says put your current password cuz your password may have been expired so I put my current and then I put my new password and it says we ve seen this before choose something stronger how do I choose something stronger when it s my current password 
len ratingone Please tell me it s my current password I can t change it and when I type random things as the password it still says we ve seen this before try something stronger do you have any explanation or help
len ratingfour The ability to get media while out and about 
len ratingfour I ve been stuck away from WiFi and needed to use my phone to sit in on meetings and have not been able to see the data which was just slides 
len ratingfour I understand preventing video heavy media but give me the option to view it 
len ratingfive Great communication app 
len ratingfive Reach all teammates any time 
len ratingfive Send important messages out to all so all are on same page at all times 
len ratingfive Get questions asked and answered timely with use 
len ratingfive Helping considerably in covid times as we cannot All be together 
len ratingfive Microsoft did a great job with Teams but not sure why they re supporting bad actors like TikTok 
len ratingthree Screen share takes up to times just to share screen
len ratingfour This app is extremely reliable 
len ratingfour I appreciate its simplicity 
len ratingfour I wish I had more ability to differentiate the teams I correspond with 
len ratingfour  I could just be new to the app though 
len ratingone It allows teachers to give you work AND FaceTime you 
len ratingone No thanks luv 
len ratingfive Love being able to use Teams on my laptop and phone for when I step away but still need to be accessible 
len ratingfive Video quality is great too 
len ratingfive Praise Internal integration of various technologies Skype Sharepoint Outlook Calendar etc 
len ratingfive and external connectivity with Office constituents is seamless and functional 
len ratingfive In particular remote meetings capabilities including chat desktop share audio all work well within our corporate network 
len ratingfive Also client based app and web based app have essentially the same functionality and look and feel which is definitely preferred 
len ratingfive iPhone based mobile app works well so far 
len ratingfive Very good compliment to the main Teams usage on my corporate Microsoft Surface Pro 
len ratingfive Criticism I was never a fan of the Sharepoint based file presentation and interface 
len ratingfive Windows Explorer in details mode using libraries shortcuts etc 
len ratingfive is preferred for file management 
len ratingfive Maybe Sharepoint file presentation is needed for tablet devices 
len ratingfive I m a longtime laptop point click user 
len ratingfive Also in meetings it was not obvious how to re display the control bar enable mute for example once the control bar disappeared automatically 
len ratingfive I learned how eventually but guidance on such important items should be more prominent 
len ratingfive I had to hunt for a solution 
len ratingfive Una aplicaci n excelente 
len ratingfive Puedes mantener reuniones con un sinn mero de persona una buena comunicaci n 
len ratingfive Y tiene varias herramienta para un buen desempe o y f cil de usar 
len ratingthree Some crashing during calls which can be very frustrating 
len ratingthree But overall good experience 
len ratingthree Also hard to see who you re chatting with can make for an easy misfire 
len ratingone This app is horrible because it is confusing
len ratingfive Works well
len ratingone This app has good moments with connecting and access to files when it lets you join 
len ratingone I m sorry to hear that your grandma passed away I actually am like obviously I m gonna be upset about that innit yeah 
len ratingfive Say no to Email 
len ratingfive No Longer use email for internal work communication 
len ratingfive One thing I would add though is that the notifications for when you have a group meeting ring like a call 
len ratingfive Currently I have to set alarms on my phone for when a group meeting is 
len ratingthree When your group consists of more then two people sometimes you want to reply to an earlier comment but you can t because there s newer comments after it 
len ratingone Not that good I prefer zoom
len ratingfive  Stars 
len ratingfive Im in Florida but when sending invites to colleagues the time comes back central vs eastern time
len ratingfive It took about a month for the MS team to resolve but notifications are working once again 
len ratingfive Thanks MS 
len ratingtwo Had to sign up to use round and round and round and round 
len ratingtwo Links don t work 
len ratingtwo What a disaster 
len ratingtwo And I m tech 
len ratingtwo I hate using zoom but at least it worksZ back to google hangouts
len ratingthree I wish there was a way to indicate available all the time whether on the app or not since I personally use my mobile app mostly of the time and my coworkers do not realize I am actually available for them via Teams 
len ratingthree Also when looking at the contact list it would be nice to see a brief comment status for a person right under their name if they choose to add one ex 
len ratingthree  Out of Office till xx xx xxxx or Working from etc 
len ratingfive I am very satisfied with the functionality of Microsoft Teams and with the integration of Microsoft Teams into my workflow 
len ratingfive It allows for seamless collaboration with my colleagues 
len ratingfive This tool can use some specific improvements like allowing incoming calls to join ongoing conversation for example 
len ratingfive But overall I give it stars 
len ratingthree Teams works fine as long as both parties have the app 
len ratingthree It is easy to use which is good 
len ratingthree But can t compete with Zoom or GoTo Meeting if the our user doesn t have the app 
len ratingthree Then it doesn t work for video chat 
len ratingone It has problems
len ratingfive I found this App very functional especially when working on team projects 
len ratingthree The reason i gave this app stars is cause of the glitches i mean like when ur in a class it just freezes and sometimes automatically signs u out for no reason This app needs improving on updating messages because they take a long time to send Good app but needs improvement 
len ratingfive  Please add white board function to iPad app
len ratingfive I thoroughly enjoy using Teams 
len ratingfive The best of all apps in the market 
len ratingfive Very easy to use with excellent UI 
len ratingfive Use this for school and it s very easy to use and not hard to understand the functions 
len ratingone Trying to join my company meeting and not working
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingfour For the most part this app has been great 
len ratingfour Connectivity has been stellar with a few issues but better than anything else I ve tried 
len ratingthree So I have been experiencing an issue related to logos and my school prefers and is recommended to have our own picture so if you could update it faster the issue will not lead me to marks loss 
len ratingfive I lost Power and was not able to use my PC 
len ratingfive But the Teams App got me back to business with my team 
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingfive Much much better than Skype for Business 
len ratingfive Team chat files and meetings are all available and useful on the phone 
len ratingfive Teams in general has come a long way this year 
len ratingfive Microsoft seems to have really put in effort to improve the product significantly since March 
len ratingfour I like the app 
len ratingfour It works well 
len ratingfour In video calls I wish the iPhone app would enable the backgrounds 
len ratingfive  We use this over counties for work and it helps tremendously with travel expense to the agency 
len ratingfive Video is very clear 
len ratingfour Need better search capabilities within a chat
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Really great for coordinating with teams and handling a lot of aspects of organizing and collaborating 
len ratingfive Necesito que bajen la versi n para poder instalarlo en mi iPad por favor
len ratingfive I started using Microsoft teams to organize my Pilates studio during the pandemic 
len ratingfive Found this platform very easy to communicate have meetings and organize material 
len ratingfive It feels a lot cleaner modern design and easier to use than Google docs 
len ratingone  Don t waste your time and money 
len ratingone Teams is horrible for education 
len ratingone Stick to Google 
len ratingfive TEAMS is working well for team meetings and training during the current Covid crisis 
len ratingone In this most recent August update the fonts are way too big 
len ratingone I have to set my system font smaller for it to be readable again 
len ratingone  Trashy 
len ratingfive I am incredibly passionate about Teams and how it delivers an optimized amp integrated experience for teams to collaborate across geographic and office boundaries 
len ratingfive With integration into outlook emails conf calls video calls chat sessions document sharing message boards etc 
len ratingfive is all integrated in Platform 
len ratingfive Use these features interactively to see the power of the teams For example I ll be on a video conf call when I decide to quickly share my screen and pull up a document from teams library 
len ratingfive My team and I can then send chat messages to other colleagues while conferencing in team member to ask a question 
len ratingfive All this occurs without ever leaving the platform 
len ratingone Links sent out never seem to open into chats on the app while on mobile 
len ratingone It will open safari for me and tell me to download the app when I already have the app 
len ratingone Almost impossible to join into chats with links on the mobile app 
len ratingone Al troubleshooting and steps online are for the computer version 
len ratingfive  Easy to use and great chat features 
len ratingfive So far it s had everything I ve tried using it for 
len ratingfive Also easy on mobile 
len ratingfive This product helps a lot with communication within our company 
len ratingfive Many times we don t have time to have a big conversation with talkative people at work every time they call so this keeps it short and to the point 
len ratingfive Just be aware of people using it just to pass messages 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive I am just amazed at how well this allowed us to switch from Office to Telework 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive This is an excellent app 
len ratingfive It is very efficient and it makes communicating with teammates easy 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingthree Teams does not allow you to sign back in early if the event is still on your calendar 
len ratingfive With the introduction of private channels and the underlying separate private group for allowing secure documents Teams is proving to be a game changer 
len ratingfive We are getting ready to launch a rollout to about employees with our new spin on the SharePoint 
len ratingfive We are a mixed group of Mac and PC iPhone and Android and I now believe Teams and it s cross platform beauty is ready for the game 
len ratingfive Thanks Microsoft and keep up the good work 
len ratingfour I love the app and use it everyday 
len ratingfour two things will add value improve the voice quality and canceling of background noise 
len ratingfour  integration with confluence page 
len ratingfive This app is amazing Like a combination of zoom and email 
len ratingthree Messes with wi fi functionality 
len ratingthree If you take a meeting on the way in or out of a building audio gets very jaggy 
len ratingthree On the way back in the app literally bars your phone from getting back on the wifi 
len ratingthree Apple needs to make sure no developers app can strong arm their stack like that 
len ratingfive Spoon feeds you
len ratingthree Desktop app shows person video can still only see other videos on the iOS app 
len ratingthree Even on the iPad version where there is plenty of space 
len ratingthree Really a bummer 
len ratingthree The phone version is nice but the desktop version needs to add Forward Messages and Reply feature 
len ratingthree Plus I would like it better if multiple message Forward was available 
len ratingfive I m so glad to be able to have so much functionality for work on the go 
len ratingfive Very smooth running updated often 
len ratingfive Super useful for productivity at work 
len ratingfive  So
len ratingfive  You saved tiktok 
len ratingfive I m in a well maintained and configured environment 
len ratingfive If it s done right teams is a joy to use we all find ourselves saying can you hear me 
len ratingfive Can you see my screen 
len ratingfive Where s John 
len ratingfive Screw it let s all meet on teams and now we just start there great product and the app does what it s supposed to 
len ratingfive My only gripe would be the need for better integration with existing windows based teams meetings and the app 
len ratingone Slack is way better 
len ratingone Teams is clunky and non intuitive 
len ratingone Only reason I use Teams is due to Microsoft s monopolist power 
len ratingone This is why competition is a good thing and a monopoly is not 
len ratingthree Okay I use Teams for online classes but my problem is that you can t change your profile picture 
len ratingthree It says to try again and or not available 
len ratingfive  thank you 
len ratingfive THANK YOU FOR BUYING TIKTOK 
len ratingfive  This app is amazing no bugs and not to much information SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE TRUMP APP 
len ratingfive  this app is amazing I can talk to my friends and it s not slow I love it so much thank you so much for creating an app this amazing 
len ratingfive Teams is a great collaboration tool as is 
len ratingfive Even better if you discover the collaboration depth with the SharePoint back end and conferencing features integrated with outlook 
len ratingfive Thankful we were using this pre Covid and were able to adapt to this strange new world 
len ratingfive  Microsoft saved TikTok love y all
len ratingfive Thanks for saving tiktok 
len ratingfive Thank you for helping not band TikTok
len ratingfive I was a reluctant participant to Microsoft Teams when it came out 
len ratingfive I felt that this is yet another application that s purporting to bring teams together and make it easier and fun for distributed teams to huddle 
len ratingfive I am glad I was wrong 
len ratingfive Teams kind of grows on you 
len ratingfive It doesn t have a lack of features but they are presented in a way that facilitates better interaction 
len ratingfive Yes there are issues when you invite someone external to participate on your Teams 
len ratingfive This part of having external users I thought was quite difficult in the beginning but it has come a long ways 
len ratingfive Also the part where you are having live events with external participants 
len ratingfive I can understand that Teams has to observe a fine line between external participation and security 
len ratingfive I think they have done that 
len ratingfive I also find the limits on video conferencing a challenge but for internal meetings it works rather well 
len ratingfive I love how you can bring in various assets into the meetings and engage with them 
len ratingfive There s a lot to love about Teams and a lot to poke holes at ultimately the type of application will drive the engagement from your participants and your eventual appreciation 
len ratingthree It would be nice to see reply to a specific message option every where and not just iPhone app
len ratingfive I am a service manager of a company that has techs in states 
len ratingfive So we always have had issues with bringing our team together 
len ratingfive This has solved that 
len ratingfive Plus connecting all those techs to the support staff in the office in one app 
len ratingfive And having the management team to have instant visibility of activity and projects we all share 
len ratingfive Again all this in one app 
len ratingfive Can t say enough good about it 
len ratingfive I used to not like you but I m since you bought TikTik i fw you for that 
len ratingfive Lysm 
len ratingfive  I study in this app Microsoft teams app i like it
len ratingthree  Pretty good 
len ratingthree Wish Ability to PLEASE forcibly mute someone and make that person STAY MUTED 
len ratingthree Think of the teachers PLEASE 
len ratingthree ALSO ability to send invite for someone to unmute themselves much like in Zoom 
len ratingthree You can request someone unmute themself and it sends them an invite 
len ratingthree Great for less tech savvy people 
len ratingtwo  Want to be able to select a Virtual Background as a default for all video calls and meetings 
len ratingtwo I m running iOS on my iPhone Xr and have already installed the most recent Teams update 
len ratingtwo The Long press on the Teams app to quickly initiate a call is NOT shown as an option 
len ratingtwo  Teams update installed and same problems exist 
len ratingtwo  Teams update installed and same problems exist 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingthree Very slow on my laptop
len ratingone Fine 
len ratingone Heres your review 
len ratingone Hopefully the pop ups stop 
len ratingfour Can t call contacts from phone app but at the same time sharing computer screen 
len ratingfour It ask me to join the screen sharing and audio from the same device 
len ratingfive  The Microsoft team app helps me stay connected even when I am away from my computer 
len ratingfive Great app and great addition 
len ratingone When I joined a call the mute button is automatically enabled and greeted out 
len ratingone I tried to unmute but I get a message that I must leave the call to unmute myself 
len ratingone Why is this a thing 
len ratingone The point of a virtual meeting is to be able to communicate 
len ratingthree  Like the new update 
len ratingthree However when on a teams call and I go to lock my iPhone XS the call is ended 
len ratingthree I d love to be able to lock my phone and stay on the call 
len ratingfour Je mettrai bien toiles mais il n y a pas la possibilit de passer des appelle vers un num ro de t l phone tiers partir de l application installer sur l iPad 
len ratingfive This app streamlines all MSFT team contents files and Channel communications that I need to check with my cell phone occasionally when I m away from my work laptop 
len ratingfive Wonderful app 
len ratingone When someone finishes a task it doesn t alert anyone 
len ratingone It should report back to the person who wrote it 
len ratingone Epic Fail 
len ratingfive I like the app 
len ratingfive Requests to rate the app are relentless please stop Microsoft team
len ratingone Sorry but Zoom is easier to navigate
len ratingone This free version comes with non working security breaches to you live account tablet and mobile devices 
len ratingone Contacting Microsoft support regarding there responsibility in supporting and allowing false and damaging version with their corporation label means talking with third party companies and reps whom are uneducated unprofessional and terrible service 
len ratingone I will have to let my employer know having Microsoft team has been a waste of time and money all the way around 
len ratingone Microsoft Support Rep name Reygen non last name illiterate is the reason the for this review 
len ratingone Terrible and non working like the company 
len ratingthree very intuitive system other than problems with intermittently not receiving notifications 
len ratingthree Hope it s fixed soon
len ratingfive This is a wonderful tool that I love using
len ratingfive Awesome App 
len ratingfive Easy to work 
len ratingfive Great Video Training in Apple 
len ratingfive Definitely 
len ratingfive Microsoft teams has some neat features with good quality reception for both audio and video 
len ratingfive In the chat feature you can not bullet thoughts 
len ratingfive When u hit enter it sends the message 
len ratingfive I would like there to be an enter creature without sending
len ratingthree Please add a reply button to make it easier to know who the moment is for 
len ratingthree In a work situation
len ratingfour My only issue with this app is that the video recordings do not playback on my phone when I go to watch them 
len ratingfour I am not sure why this is but it is very frustrating 
len ratingthree Great app only issue is I m only receiving notifications intermittently and I have no idea why 
len ratingfour My only criticism would be that my Teams app doesn t allow me to call people outside of my Organisation if they haven t been included and it hasn t been set up in my Outlook calendar set as a Teams meeting 
len ratingfour  Unless I missed how to do it 
len ratingfive Perfect app to stay in communication with employees and conference calls
len ratingthree  Pretty good 
len ratingthree Wish Ability to PLEASE forcibly mute someone and make that person STAY MUTED 
len ratingthree Think of the teachers PLEASE 
len ratingthree ALSO ability to send invite for someone to unmute themselves much like in Zoom 
len ratingthree You can request someone unmute themself and it sends them an invite 
len ratingthree Great for less tech savvy people 
len ratingone  The UX UI is disappointing
len ratingfive Now i can play minecraft whit my friends at school
len ratingthree There is no replacement for Slack
len ratingfive Very helpful features Easy to use
len ratingfour Pooop emoji is very important
len ratingfive But only because they make me use it at work 
len ratingfive Practical and applicable
len ratingone App keeps crashing since update 
len ratingone  If I m gonna use online school I wanna use ZOOM
len ratingfive the app is a really helpful way to stay in contact with my teams during covid 
len ratingfive nothing will ever replace face to face interactions but Teams is a very helpful tool 
len ratingfour I think its much faster than the desktop version 
len ratingfour Would love to see share screen mode as well if at all possible 
len ratingthree Desperately need virtual backgrounds for mobile use 
len ratingthree Big feature missing that is crucial for mobile 
len ratingone I can t delete the accounts I have logged in 
len ratingone It s terrible 
len ratingthree  Me gusta mucho la app 
len ratingthree Es muy completa y permite trabajar muy bien 
len ratingthree Sin embargo tiene varios fallos relacionados con bugs que no permiten ver bien la pantalla compartida ya que est se ve completamente distorsionada no por falta de internet sino en serio distorsionada y de los colores que no son pero supongo que esto se arreglar pronto 
len ratingthree Las funciones del paquete de office en l nea son muy limitadas y no permite hacer muchas modificaciones grandes en un periodo corto de tiempo o se va a trabar 
len ratingthree Olviden las macros en l nea 
len ratingthree Decent app but it s using of my phone s battery in the background over just a couple hours 
len ratingfive AWESOME 
len ratingfour I love this app it is so easy to use 
len ratingfour My ONE request is please please change the monthly shift view to look like an actually block calendar instead of long horizontal lines 
len ratingfour It is just awful 
len ratingtwo We use Teams all the time but suddenly the iPhone apps fonts are HUGE and there is no way to change it 
len ratingtwo What s up Microsoft 
len ratingtwo Not receiving any notifications despite trying every troubleshooting method available online 
len ratingthree Microsoft teams has a lot of cool features 
len ratingthree It is very secured 
len ratingthree But a problem with the app is when the network speed is low or more number of users login into the the same meeting the features offered for both the presenter and attendee keep disappearing 
len ratingthree So the advantage ms teams has over other apps is lost 
len ratingthree My institution uses the app and all presenters face the same problem 
len ratingthree The app may still be a beta version I do not know 
len ratingthree But they need to fix these issues fast 
len ratingthree Otherwise people will quit on Microsoft and switch to google which is more user friendly 
len ratingone We use this app a lot for work and we have it downloaded on our phones and today the application stop working it keeps kicking us out when we try to open the app please look into this
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingthree I love having Teams available on my iPad Pro 
len ratingthree However this app in its current state is too basic and does not match the Pro level abilities of the latest iPad Pros 
len ratingthree It feels too much of a bigger iPhone app 
len ratingthree For example I can t view a file that s been uploaded in a Teams meeting 
len ratingthree The only way I can view the file that is being projected is if the host is doing a screen share from their device 
len ratingthree This is the same issue on my iPhone 
len ratingthree I would understand this being an issue on the iPhone but not on the iPad Pro 
len ratingthree Teams needs to have significantly more desktop features on iPad Pro 
len ratingthree I hope I am woefully ignorant and its an error on my end the almost star review of this app makes me think I am but it is not readily apparent either way 
len ratingthree I hope this gets updated and if it does this app will be a star app for me 
len ratingone In the latest version the notifications really stink 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive Does what it is supposed to and easy to use 
len ratingfive Ability to jot down some notes under calls and meetings for personal use historical context for later would be helpful
len ratingfive This tool is quite friendly and easy to handle and I think is better than Skype 
len ratingfive The only concern is that I think at this stage it is only corporate and restricted to the public so I wonder if this APP will be access to everybody 
len ratingone La aplicaci n en s es muy buena pero si solo puedo escuchar las clases grabadas pero no verlas no me sirve de mucho 
len ratingone Para m es un gran problema porque tengo muchas clases que son bastantes visuales como dibujo 
len ratingone Espero puedan arreglarlo porque ayudar a mucho para aquellos estudiantes que no tienen una computadora y solo pueden estudiar a trav s del celular 
len ratingone Pd los videos grabados desde junio son los que est n presentando este problema 
len ratingone Hasta el momento no veo que se haya solucionado 
len ratingone Pd No puede ser problema de mi celular porque ya lo he probado en celulares y tienen el mismo problema 
len ratingthree It would be great if teams has an option to point on the screen to show presenter what we are talking about 
len ratingthree Marking on screen or highlighting specific text e t c
len ratingfour Good App to stay connected
len ratingthree Like others I am experiencing the App opening for second and then crashing 
len ratingthree This began today July after Before I updated to the latest version of the app

len ratingfour I have the latest update and it s a real inconvenience can you fix this 
len ratingone The Teams app keeps crashing immediately after I log in using my iPad 
len ratingone All software is up to date and I have tried deleting the app restarting and reinstalling but the problem recurs 
len ratingone It was working well but now crashes constantly on iPhone s
len ratingone Not sure what s been going on with the app but has been crashing for the past week it feels like 
len ratingone Crash happens seconds into opening even after hard reboot of iPhone or iPad 
len ratingone Had been working perfectly fine for months 
len ratingone Will revise rating if fixed but un usable atm 
len ratingone Latest version crashes every single time you open it 
len ratingone Restarted app 
len ratingone Rebooted phone 
len ratingone Removed and reinstalled app 
len ratingone Runs fine in background and gets notifications of messages 
len ratingone But try and open the app and it just crashes back to home screen 
len ratingone I ve never seen an iPhone app fail no miserably in over a decade of ownership 
len ratingone Otherwise prior to current version 
len ratingone Teams had been working fine for a year now 
len ratingone Constant updates 
len ratingone Many improvements 
len ratingone Still very basic compared to what other companies are doing or even what is available on their desktop version 
len ratingone I put my work email and password into the login screen 
len ratingone It took me to allowances for notifications and then just shut down 
len ratingone Every time I try to open the app it just closes 
len ratingone I need this for work 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone Latest update crashes app
len ratingone After the last update I updated the app crashes while it loads 
len ratingtwo Just started crashing 
len ratingtwo Tried uninstalling app on phone and desktop 
len ratingtwo Still no good
len ratingone Ordene una pizza por esta app y nunca llego 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I love how even though I home working teams it makes me feel right there in the office 
len ratingone I have teams on my desktop and laptop but on my iPhone it kicks me out and says only my IT admin can add me and kicks me out 
len ratingone I spoke with IT and they said i have should have access but it still tells me I have access restrictions 
len ratingfive Teams is a great technology platform that allows me to collaborate with my entire company 
len ratingone  Me dio cancer
len ratingfive This app is a game changer our dept 
len ratingfive applied this tool to the way we work with ease and it has been really nice to watch it all happen 
len ratingfive Grateful 
len ratingfive I love TEAMS because it s easy to use 
len ratingfive I love TEAMS because it provides powerful tools to enhance the experience for all 
len ratingfive I love TEAMS because it creates connection amongst the participants 
len ratingtwo Since schools have shut our preschool program has been using teams 
len ratingtwo So far it s been an easy app to use 
len ratingtwo However since the last update I can t react to the teacher s posts for our team 
len ratingtwo Our principal has muted staff and parents from comments in the group but has allowed us reaction 
len ratingtwo Which stinks because it looks like am not checking in with my teacher s daily lessons 
len ratingtwo Before the updates I had no problems leaving or 
len ratingtwo Until I can react again am leaving a two star review 
len ratingfive I have never written a review on any app even the ones I like 
len ratingfive Don t ask why however I had to write one on teams because it s healed a lot of unneeded frustration in the sales entry aspects of my career 
len ratingfive I have been able to talk to internal customer service people without waiting I the cue on the phone for a simple fix 
len ratingfive Reach back out to the same service people if the previous issue is unresolved instead of trying to find Nemo in an ocean of service people when calling back 
len ratingfive I ve been able to see and understand my organization s structure and look up managers and key organizational people 
len ratingfive Also I ve strengthened more working relationships within my organization 
len ratingfive Teams is an effective and efficient systems and tool which has even More to offer than I care to type 
len ratingfive MS teams has been a great platform for me to attend meetings
len ratingfive I originally started using teams because of my employer but once I started my own business it was a no brained 
len ratingfive It makes communicating with my employees so easy and effortless 
len ratingfour I find the Teams app to be SOO much quicker than Teams in the laptop 
len ratingfour Not sure why but I get msgs about seconds QUICKER through the mobile app than on the computer 
len ratingfour The only issue is I m no longer getting notifications and I can t figure out why 
len ratingfour Notifications are turned on on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo  Screen goes black for recorded videos can t review them back not on this phone but on others and computers 
len ratingtwo Too long to load 
len ratingtwo Sometimes it lags and it is not the internet problem 
len ratingtwo Please fix it 
len ratingfour Only discrepancy I have is when you have a day off you get notified through email every time someone sends a message 
len ratingfour So when you return you have a million emails stating who had messages through teams 
len ratingfour That s the only reason for a star 
len ratingfive It is awesome I live it 
len ratingfive It has so many cool features 
len ratingfive I totally recommend it 
len ratingfive I love it but the only thing I would like to do is delete chat history 
len ratingfive Thanks Roger
len ratingone While teaching a class the share options are sometimes not there 
len ratingone Often I ll tap the screen while teaching a class the icons come up but not all of them 
len ratingfive Outstanding service best on the market
len ratingfive The only negative I find is that once I type in a message there is a line that remains even after I delete the message 
len ratingfive Not sure what purpose it is intended to serve but for our purposes it just clutters up the channels unnecessarily 
len ratingfive Sometimes a comment serves its purpose and eliminating it from the chain allows for clearer instructions 
len ratingfive Love being able to stay connected to my team even away from my desk
len ratingfive I ve been using Team since this July and I love it 
len ratingfive It is awesome 
len ratingfive I would recommend this application to anyone especially in this time of pandemic we are experiencing 
len ratingone Seems like looks like you re offline while every single app on your phone works perfectly is teams favorite thing to say 
len ratingone Blaming the customer rather then the poor platform 
len ratingfive Started using this for work pretty handy 
len ratingfive One app for meetings calendars and planning
len ratingfive The MS team really hit a home run 
len ratingfive The only criticism I have is that there are some buttons in the bottom toolbar that have huge functionality perhaps a bigger button would make sense 
len ratingfour Stop making me re log in pleasedo what messenger Hi Georgey Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfour Could you please go to Settings and Send Feedback to us 
len ratingfour This will help us get more information to solve your issue 
len ratingthree Love this app while I m on the go but have to have it open to receive notifications 
len ratingfour  Phenomenal app and works well on the iPhone 
len ratingfour During late night meetings however it would be nice to have a more adaptive UI go black or dark gray instead of a bright white chat view 
len ratingthree I cannot start a meeting from my end because the video or call buttons are not showing up on my app
len ratingone Stream yikes by nicki minaj 
len ratingfour When using the teams app in computer it crashes suddenly and fails to Write anything
len ratingfive Teams is by far the best communication tool in our gearbox 
len ratingfive Effective quick well intermediated 
len ratingfive Only recommendation is to build the menu bar with greater capabilities including favorites for links to share point file folder structure 
len ratingfive There are a few additional features that will make it a force not easily removed as the dominant player of communications 
len ratingone  laggy and never works for a full class so many technical issues
len ratingthree I ve had major issues with my calendar section of the app never loading 
len ratingthree It continually says it is updating but never finishes loading 
len ratingthree I would also really love to have more features that mirror the desktop app 
len ratingthree I can t initiate using the whiteboard from a video call but I can participate if someone else starts it 
len ratingthree As a teacher I d love to use this 
len ratingthree It is also really difficult to use video conferencing for teaching because I cant keep the chat open with the video screen at the same time 
len ratingthree Please consider adding a pop out where the chat can come up next to the video like the desktop app 
len ratingthree I also find it difficult that I can only use one note if it launches the app which also lack features that are available on the desktop version like the math function rather than being able to use OneNote directly from teams 
len ratingthree Lastly I want to be able to manage my teams from my iPad app because currently some of the manage features are only available on the desktop version 
len ratingthree Otherwise the platform itself isn t bad and some parts of the app such as assignments are exactly the same as the desktop version if I have them side by side to compare 
len ratingthree I m not sure why the app has less functionality than the desktop version but with so many people using tablets nowadays especially to teach from please make them the same with all functionality 
len ratingone The MS Teams app was working fine up till this morning now it just crashes 
len ratingone I have tried deleting and reinstalling the app and yes on the current version of the app already and updated iOS on my iPhone Pro a few days ago 
len ratingone So everything updated and now app crashes 
len ratingone Will change review if when fixed till then only star 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingone Too many requests for feedback 
len ratingthree I m reeeeallly trying to be patient as Microsoft s offerings overall are great 
len ratingthree But I ve had this issue gripe since with Skype for Business when is Microsoft going to perform this ONE CRITICAL UPDATE 
len ratingthree The videoconferencing is good but limited in several ways 
len ratingthree I m seriously considering bearing the cost of RingCentral so potential clients can text me directly through my business line instead of my personal line e mail or moving on to another vendor 
len ratingthree I ve lost business due to this issue 
len ratingthree  come on MS 
len ratingthree Add the SMS feature in Teams ASAP 
len ratingfive TEAMS gives the users choices on how to receive sound through the computer sound card or by calling the user on a phone 
len ratingfive In addition the presenter can switch on the SYSTEM SOUND which allows prerecorded material like music and videos to be effectively transmitted to the TEAM 
len ratingfour Yes yes yes yes yes 
len ratingfour Yes yes yes
len ratingtwo I downloaded the Teams app for the first time 
len ratingtwo I have a new phone 
len ratingtwo New carrier 
len ratingtwo It showed two accounts to select from for logging in 
len ratingtwo Both accounts are from former employers years old accounts in which I never used Teams while employed at those orgs 
len ratingtwo How are they there 
len ratingtwo Creepy How do I delete them 
len ratingtwo There appears to be no way 
len ratingtwo I ve tried reading all the online forums I can find 
len ratingtwo How stupid of a design is that to not let users delete old accounts 
len ratingone After the last update notification are not coming through 
len ratingone No matter what the settings are they aren t coming through 
len ratingone Works fine on the desktop but not on the phone 
len ratingone I have to open the app to see if there are new messages 
len ratingone Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingfour  Microsoft has created a truly outstanding tool that has proved itself invaluable with regards to remote working from an iPad iPhone 
len ratingfour A few items that would be game changers On iPad allow users to open chat participant list in a sidebar while still viewing the participants in the call 
len ratingfour The fact that the entirety of the screen is taken up by chat and participant list is a major frustration when monitoring groups and or chat 
len ratingfour  In call support keyboard shortcuts for muting unmuting opening chat participant list at a minimum 
len ratingfour The recent addition of keyboard for formatting posts is appreciated 
len ratingfour  As many have mentioned feature parity with desktop browser with regards to allowing to view participants is a must 
len ratingfour Even if this option is relegated to more powerful hardware iPad Pro 
len ratingfour  This is more of an iOS limitation I imagine but the ability to use the camera in the background thereby not showing the avatar while multitasking 
len ratingfour Even better allowing PIP of the current speaker as done in FaceTime would be a true game changer 
len ratingfour Thanks for all the fantastic work on the app 
len ratingthree I like the app 
len ratingthree I hate the update 
len ratingthree Apparently I am either an idiot for not being able to find YouTube Google etc 
len ratingthree the option in the app to change the font size in the chats or the developers are idiots for connecting the chat fonts to the DEVICE font settings and NOT making an option for the app to change the chat font 
len ratingthree My chats fonts are size or something 
len ratingthree  sentences takes up the whole screen now 
len ratingthree I don t want to change my device font setting which affects everything just for one app 
len ratingfive This tool has been such a huge timesaver and has really brought our company together through this whole pandemic 
len ratingfive Looking forward to how we can maximize our efficiencies as we go forward
len ratingfour There is no way to follow oa meeting or a call from one device to the other
len ratingfive Excellent an answer to a small businesses needs 
len ratingone Latest version of this app caused it to become completely non functional 
len ratingfive Not bad when my vpn dies too
len ratingfive Excellent service
len ratingthree Had problems with shared screen and calendar invites must add participants individually 
len ratingthree When I do a calendar invite in Teams everyone in that team receives the invite 
len ratingone After the latest update notifications are not appearing as well as no sounds for notifications are working 
len ratingone I have to actually manually check the app to see if I have any new messages 
len ratingone i hate this application
len ratingfour Good app to keep people connected during Covid
len ratingfive The app is well designed and works as expected 
len ratingfive Kindly help me find access to some of the tabs that is not reflecting on my screen like raise my hand and share my screen 
len ratingone I think it s poor that that MS provide such poor quality of support for issues on there community forum regarding iOS issues especially regarding the inability to function with Apple AirPods Pro 
len ratingone My main problem is that on my IPhone XS Max with AirPods Pro or just the phone go to check the voicemail I can t hear anything 
len ratingone So I go to the community forum to find that MS completely abandoned all the conversations about Airpods and AirPods Pro connection issues 
len ratingone I hate to say it but with poor of service from a reputable company during a time where lot s businesses have switched to a mobile platform unlike another time I believe businesses should respond by dropping this product fast 
len ratingone As your community forum demonstrates customer service and support for this product doesn t seem to matter to MS 
len ratingone Sad part is the product overall seems to be a great concept but no follow through 
len ratingthree  Pretty good 
len ratingthree Wish Ability to share screen from iPad and not just desktop computer 
len ratingthree Ability to PLEASE forcibly mute someone and make that person STAY MUTED 
len ratingthree Think of the teachers PLEASE 
len ratingthree  Want to be able to select a Virtual Background as a default for all video calls and meetings 
len ratingthree I m running iOS on my iPhone Xr and have already installed the most recent Teams update 
len ratingthree The Long press on the Teams app to quickly initiate a call is NOT shown as an option 
len ratingthree  Teams update installed and same problems exist 
len ratingone Save us
len ratingfive  I have Personal and this is a perfect companion for that now 
len ratingfive Iota efficient and helps facilitate work and on the go 
len ratingfive Nearly great but needs integration with Outlook contacts 
len ratingfive Very intuitive 
len ratingfive Teams has greatly helped my center improve on Communication between our Management and Quality Departments 
len ratingfive I m still learning all that Teams can do and I d say it has definitely replaced other communication applications such as emails calendars Skype 
len ratingtwo I recently had to download teams for work to do video conferencing on a company issued iOS device and I can open the app fine but as soon as I attempt to go to my calendar and join a meeting the app crashes 
len ratingfour  It s really great app we use it a lot for in my job but I really hope to see new version for Apple TV in future it must be 
len ratingone Every time I try to join the meetings from the invitation that s sent to me through email by clicking Join Meeting it doesn t take me straight to it at all to the point I had to reschedule till I could get it to work and still can t 
len ratingone This app is very flawed 
len ratingtwo Anyone else have issues using AirPods with the Teams app 
len ratingtwo My mic stops working about minutes into calls 
len ratingone So when I downloaded the app and open it I get a team channel unavailable which I m assuming that s the middle tab that friends are showing me a screenshot saying I should have this just don t know why that unavailable try again later is popping up 
len ratingone Like I said before up here once I click calendar it shuts the app down 
len ratingone Any explanation for that 
len ratingfive Well built 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Works so well 
len ratingone Teams has had its share of challenges but releasing two versions in a row that crash while opening rendering it useless is beyond poor form 
len ratingtwo Good video quality with no lag compared to Cisco Webex and Zoom but it s frustrating that the iPad app only shows faces at a time one of which is yours 
len ratingtwo Unlike Webex and Zoom you don t even have the option of swiping to see other participants videos 
len ratingtwo So you only see other faces only one of which switched to various people talking 
len ratingtwo The other faces strangely remained constant during a video conference with other people 
len ratingtwo Despite spending a lot of time Googling I did not come across any article indicating that the iPad app still had this limitation as of mid July despite articles back in April that MS had increased the view to people which I now realize is limited to the desktop app 
len ratingtwo In any event kudos to Microsoft to allowing unlimited video conference times for free accounts when Webex has reverted to a minute time limit and Zoom has always had a minute limit 
len ratingthree I love using teams 
len ratingthree It is sleek and so well put together and seemlessly incorporates many needed features for conferences and meetings 
len ratingthree I can get a quick note to my colleagues easily without having to know their contact info but if I need their contact information it s right there at my fingertips 
len ratingthree It does not work at all with iPhone X which is a known issue but hasn t been fixed 
len ratingthree There is no workaround I know of 
len ratingtwo  Good video quality compared to Cisco Webex and Zoom but it s frustrating that the iPad app only shows faces at a time one of which is yours 
len ratingtwo You can t swipe to see other faces 
len ratingtwo So you only see other faces only one of which will switch to another person depending on who is speaking 
len ratingtwo In any event kudos to Microsoft to allowing unlimited video conference times for free accounts when Webex has reverted to a minute time limit and Zoom has always had a minute limit 
len ratingone Kinda trash ngl
len ratingfive Excellent tool for work very helpful tool to keep me organize 
len ratingfive It s very efficient for quick instant messaging and communication 
len ratingfive This app is great for using it for webinars good photos and messaging
len ratingone Teams is horrible it is a platform for abuse to gen z teachers use this platform to mentally torture their students
len ratingthree I am unable to access the recording feature on both my phone or computer
len ratingfive It s very good app
len ratingfive This is the best
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive It s a really good tool 
len ratingfive Very complete 
len ratingfive I haven t needed nothing else 
len ratingfour I really just need the app for the chat functionality 
len ratingfour I have seen many many others who have commented that they do not like the auto change of status 
len ratingfour If I set my status leave it as is 
len ratingfour I have seen this over many years so it seems you want change it for some reason 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive Great app for the times we estamos en
len ratingfive It s a great way to communicate with colleagues remotely and hop on a video or do a quick phone call without picking up your phone 
len ratingfive It would be nice if I could use it like an instant message with outside volunteers
len ratingfour I think my only issue with this app is that it shows me there are notifications with red badges even when there are none 
len ratingfour For example right now it shows on the red badge even though I ve opened them all on the app 
len ratingfour Further there appears to be no connection between the iOS app and the PC version for notifications 
len ratingfour If I view items on the PC the badge icon on the iOS app should be cleared 
len ratingfour And for sure it should be cleared after I open the iOS app 
len ratingfour But it does not clear the badge icon 
len ratingthree  Want to be able to select a Virtual Background as a default for all video calls and meetings 
len ratingthree I m running iOS on my iPhone Xr and have already installed the most recent Teams update 
len ratingthree The Long press on the Teams app to quickly initiate a call is NOT shown as an option 
len ratingfive provides a good option for having meetings and support virtual training 
len ratingfour It does what it is supposed to do a basic chat room essentially with nice separations and easy navigation 
len ratingfour Notifications are over bearing during quite hours you will be notified of missing notifications defeating the purpose of it 
len ratingfour If you have the teams app open on desktop you will still actively receive notifications on your phone 
len ratingfour After using for months it gets rather annoying 
len ratingfour There isn t much in the way of fixing this either in the all settings 
len ratingfour You could hard fix it in iOS settings but then that would defeat the purpose of notifications 
len ratingfive This allows me to take work on the go very helpful app 
len ratingone Even if you set quiet hours on your device while you re not working this Teams app will still allow calls to come through 
len ratingone  hours a day days a week 
len ratingone Microsoft admits there is no way to prevent them 
len ratingone That is beyond inexcusable it is willfully malicious 
len ratingone Stay away from Teams unless you live at work and don t sleep 
len ratingtwo It would be beneficial if a communication is urgent to have a flashing beacon to notify recipient of a matter requiring immediate attention 
len ratingfour It would be perfect if the teams video chat showed more people on the iPad or if you could arrange the boxes differently 
len ratingfive Excellent tool for school
len ratingfive Good program very reliable
len ratingfour Has anyone else had issues with the reading of excel files on iPhone 
len ratingfour No text shows up only color fills after a certain date of upload 
len ratingfive It s very good and helpful
len ratingfive The quality of the Microsoft Teams app is amazing 
len ratingfive It allows me to connect with my colleagues and management seamlessly 
len ratingfive The audio and video works very well 
len ratingfour Good app overall allows good capabilities to work together on files 
len ratingfour Larger teams more than members audio is a problem
len ratingfive Would like it to be joinable to DOD sharepoint and outlook calendar
len ratingfive I like that I can communicate with coworkers without giving my personal phone number 
len ratingfour Please provide the option to delete chats 
len ratingfour Why do you think I want to collect ALL my chats 
len ratingfour Most of them are just situation related and useless the next day 
len ratingfour And then the accident chats from people I don t know 
len ratingfour I want to delete these 
len ratingfour It is distracting and annoying 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingfive And it s free for most features
len ratingone  Shuts down if necessary to switch Apps to respond to an email or text 
len ratingone As a comparison Google Meet keeps running in background if I switch apps
len ratingfour Love Teams Would love to be able to share a meeting invite that was not created by myself with other coworkers 
len ratingfour If this is possible already please tell 
len ratingfive The best app I have used in last couple decades to connect with colleagues customers and vendors 
len ratingfive The part I like best in addition to meeting and screen sharing capabilities is the ability to create structured folders and share files within team or with meeting participants 
len ratingtwo I keep downloading Teams it won t work
len ratingfive We love this app 
len ratingfive Great collaborative tool
len ratingfive I have been teaching virtually since March and teams has been my favorite platform 
len ratingfive Our local school district chose to use teams and as a teacher I m so happy to communicate with my student on the level that I have been 
len ratingone I updated the app yesterday and it stopped sending me notifications 
len ratingone No settings were changed on my part and now the software I m dependent on for working remotely and staying in contact with my employees is malfunctioning 
len ratingfour Need to have access to setting up a virtual background before you start a call 
len ratingfour N
len ratingthree Should have settings to select more preferences customization 
len ratingthree I don t want it to send every time I hit enter it chat enter should mean return go to next line 
len ratingthree I m having trouble sharing documents on the site
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingone FOR THIS APP I LOSTED ONE CLASS BECAUSE I HAVE NOTIFICATIONS ON BUT THIS APP DOENST SENDED ME THE NOTIFICATION NOW I NEED TO SAY TO THE TEACHER I NEED THE HOMEWORK FOR A STUPID APP 
len ratingone  would not recommend 
len ratingone Invite link does not work for family members 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams by far the quickest way to transfer information in the form of a message picture programming file etc 
len ratingfive between individuals who collaborate together 
len ratingfive The efficiency of this app makes the user feel as if they are talking to a peer or supervisor just a few desks away 
len ratingfive With the simplicity of a text message this is the go to communication application for businesses everywhere 
len ratingtwo  Hello My Apple AirPods work great on teams except when I go to make a video call 
len ratingtwo As soon as the call is connected my AirPod connection with teams drops 
len ratingtwo It shows they are connected by the microphone and sound is coming from the phone and not the AirPods 
len ratingtwo Please look into this as it only is happening when making video calls 
len ratingfive Very easy to communicate with coworkers 
len ratingone It doesn t seem ready for production 
len ratingone The deployment appears to be rushed in light of Covid 
len ratingone Horrible product 
len ratingfive This is something that I would have never dreamed o 
len ratingfive This app making anything possible 
len ratingfive Teams helps me stay connected with the team members amp reach out for collaboration in an efficient amp effective manner 
len ratingfour Teams needs much more work to make it as effective as Outlook 
len ratingfour Communicator was a much better tool with Outlook Calendar than Teams 
len ratingfive Very reliable and easy to use and very good interface
len ratingone No tiene modo oscuro 
len ratingfive This is many many times better than the old Skype for Business service 
len ratingfive It bests Zoom and is way beyond WebEx in terms of stability and functionality 
len ratingfive The teams app is a very effective tool to help manage a team and keep everyone on the same page and communicating 
len ratingfive During this pandemic teams made it extremely easy to work from home 
len ratingfive Teams works great for remote offices 
len ratingfive Convenient I can my favorite option is that I can utilize Teams on my phone or computer seamlessly 
len ratingfive I didn t realize working from home and work life balance could be obtained with teams 
len ratingtwo This is the only app I ve ever used that constantly keeps turning my phone screen black for some reason
len ratingfive This app provides many options for communicating with coworkers 
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingone Video button is suddenly not working on any device for all my classmates
len ratingfour Would be stars if there was a way to change the notification sound 
len ratingfour  Hello happy to here that you like Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfour You can change notification sound by going to Settings gt Notifications in Teams 
len ratingfour The notification sound picker is towards the bottom of that page 
len ratingfive Supongo que los lectores de estas rese as son usuarios de Microsoft por Windows pero les quiero advertir se estaban perdiendo de una forma Super productiva para trabajar
len ratingone really too bad that this is required for my education and it doesn t even work on both my laptop and iphone even when i m connected to the internet 
len ratingone the quality is just awful and glitches out my devices 
len ratingone like rly microsoft can do so much better
len ratingone  My video is not working
len ratingfive Thanks for making such a nice App 
len ratingone For some reason cannot connect to calls from either my Iphone or my Ipad but have no problem with Windows laptop on the same wifi 
len ratingone The error message says Im not connected to internet cant believe this day and age that would be the case 
len ratingone If you cant connect a call 
len ratingone  Absolutely awful
len ratingtwo This app is fantastic 
len ratingtwo The only problem is that I use onedrive as well and it communicates horribly with this app 
len ratingtwo That is a must for me because both services are integral to my work 
len ratingtwo It actually integrated better with DropBox back when I used to pay for that service 
len ratingtwo I usually don t like to leave bad reviews but I really need this to get fixed so I m hoping this catches the attention of the devs at Microsoft 
len ratingtwo When it gets fixed I d be happy to edit this review and I hope to because Teams would be OUTSTANDING if not for this issue 
len ratingfive Joking aside this is an amazing app on win and mobile 
len ratingfive I love MS teams for its agility and thoroughness in connecting people in a professional set up
len ratingfour I would really like to be able to move that Tool bar off to the side that is sitting mid screen when in meeting 
len ratingfive Very fast 
len ratingfive And I just enjoy using it has best GIF
len ratingone I don t understand why they d release a full version of Teams if only the most basic functions work 
len ratingone The interface has everything needed to for example add and edit files within individual teams but those functions don t actually work 
len ratingfive I think without team during this pandemic work from home would not be as smooth 
len ratingfive This app help keep me employed 
len ratingfive It s very useful and user friendly 
len ratingfive It doesn t consume more data also 
len ratingfive Using teams mobile app with an ear pod makes it much easier to participate in meetings while also working on my computer ahhhh the curse of multi tasking 
len ratingfive I find the app easy to navigate and the integration all works quite well 
len ratingfour Teams has been invaluable during the Covid lockdown and will continue to be the way to communicate into the future 
len ratingfour Only thing I would change is having a spell checker 
len ratingfour Please allow people in the planner buckets
len ratingfive Love using Teams at work 
len ratingfive The improvements that have been made especially in the last months or so really improve the user experience and it was good to begin with 
len ratingfive My organization uses it constantly now that we re all working from home 
len ratingfive It s been invaluable for collaboration and communication 
len ratingfive The one thing that is at the top of my list to add is Apple Watch integration with a compilation to easily chat and get notifications 
len ratingone Esclavitud 
len ratingfive But for some reason it is crashing on launch on my iPad Pro 
len ratingfive Assuming that gets cleaned up I kind of think I could really start living my best Office life 
len ratingfive Hopefully the upcoming new features of teams will be available on iOS sooner rather than later 
len ratingone Cada vez que tengo que mandar una tarea me dice enviar de nuevo y las profesoras me culpan a mi
len ratingone How the hell am I gonna face time someone and it s listed priority to teams for face time or call smh never again DONT USE IT THIS IS SUS THEY GOT INTO MY CONTACTS NEVER AGAIN DONT USE
len ratingfive Great equivalent of the desktop version 
len ratingfive Well integrated with one drive and outlook 
len ratingfive Chats and team calls work well Regular updates provided too 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfive During these trying times tweets business needs to evolve this app has been an absolute essential asset to my team 
len ratingfive File editing on the go messaging and calling seamlessly just amazing 
len ratingfive No glitches that I can remember and great reliability 
len ratingfive  star all the way 
len ratingone No tiene modo negro
len ratingone Every time I see random people in my chat And when I text to my friends it started deleting my messages to people and I found that there s an email in your profile so people can go and see in my account and log in my account and sees all my private messages and found bad messages please fix this problem Bradley Chu
len ratingfive Each team member has the app on their computer and phone 
len ratingfive We use the messaging quite a bit screen sharing and screen recording 
len ratingfive Muy buena y vers til
len ratingone This app freezes my phone every time I open it 
len ratingone Only app that does this 
len ratingfive When we are write private messages it would be nice to be able to reply
len ratingfive I love how things are integrated here super useful for whatever your team might be working on 
len ratingone I have multiple teams on my account my company a partner agency and my client 
len ratingone It is absolute hell switching between these 
len ratingone It makes me login with two step verification upwards of times per day 
len ratingone It s all under the same email and password but continues to require new login 
len ratingone It s insufferable and hardly efficient 
len ratingone Slack is x better 
len ratingfour I like the app but had issues during a meeting with the audio I was told that it was breaking and then my voice would sound at a fast speed 
len ratingfive This app is so needed if you have a windows OS or just even if your company or business uses any other windows programs 
len ratingfive It makes file sharing with co workers a breeze never seems to crash and has a very intuitive interface which makes adapting your whole company to this program so easy 
len ratingfive The of bugs I ve found is in the video call conference call function like losing audio or visual feeds occasionally I use cheap logitec mics and cameras so that might be the issue there but I think the faults are very understandable considering the volume of people using this function post covid 
len ratingfive I would still highly recommend over other video chat programs like Zoom 
len ratingone Won t work with safari what good is it 
len ratingone Zoom is much better
len ratingthree Have been using Cisco Jabber and transitioning to Teams 
len ratingthree Although the mobile app is good the desktop version is very slow and times out after trying to send the message for quite a long time
len ratingfive The app is great 
len ratingfive I can set notifications just how I want them 
len ratingfive I can have meetings away from my laptop 
len ratingfive It just needs a watch app so I can walk away from my phone 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive More to learn though 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingthree Read messages don t get marked read on the mobile app 
len ratingthree So annoying 
len ratingone WORST APP EVER
len ratingfive The outlook killed 
len ratingone  I don t like the app
len ratingfive Really like Teams 
len ratingfive Makes video and or audio calls and recording them super easy 
len ratingfive Like the app when on the go
len ratingfive Now my coworkers think I m sitting behind my laptop 
len ratingfive Little do they know 
len ratingfour Just getting started 
len ratingfour Seems good so far
len ratingfive Was worried to try but it is pretty easy and works great 
len ratingfour Love the app 
len ratingfive I love that I can continue to communicate with my team while out and about 
len ratingfive Don t have to wait to get back to the office to assist others
len ratingfive  The funny thing it has features better than that of the Windows app like real to a message
len ratingfive This app is excellent for an business who wants to communicate and share information with colleagues 
len ratingfive You can use other apps and provide presentations 
len ratingfive Teams work great 
len ratingfive I enjoy quickly getting help to my answers 
len ratingthree My company decided to use Microsoft Teams exclusively 
len ratingthree I ve used the app in both iPad and iPhone 
len ratingthree The iPad app seems to be OK but one of features that Teams needs to fix is that you can t chat as the video conference is going on 
len ratingthree If my colleagues are on a laptop and sending messages I don t see it 
len ratingthree I am able to see the conversations after I ve ended the video conference 
len ratingthree Also the iPhone X iOS video only seems to work in portrait 
len ratingthree And what looks OK on my end looks horribly up close for my recipients think funhouse convex mirror with an extended wide side view 
len ratingthree When I set the iPhone in landscape the others see me turned to the side still hideously up close 
len ratingthree I literally need to hold the iPhone at arms length and lean back before others can see me at a normal size but now I have the joy of looking out to the conferencees with a double chin 
len ratingthree Microsoft fix this 
len ratingfive Microsoft does it again 
len ratingfive Teams is the now and the future 
len ratingthree It is not intuitive 
len ratingthree I constantly close down the whole app 
len ratingthree All my IM go to entire group and that is dangerous 
len ratingthree Sharing screen is a pain 
len ratingthree The people never see the screen I am sharing 
len ratingthree Constantly have to stop sharing then start sharing again when I change to something new 
len ratingthree Not clear to see who is talking on meetings 
len ratingfive This app is the best
len ratingfive  I personally like this app better than slack
len ratingfive  Could not do my job effectively without it 
len ratingfive Well I guess that isn t true but you get the point 
len ratingfive It is amazing 
len ratingfive I can communicate important announcements have impromptu or scheduled meetings with ease get up to the minute info on where we are in a project sprint using Planner and drive metrics on the health of our projects all in one application 
len ratingfive My team loves it and it is easy for everyone to use 
len ratingfive We get really creative with our use off Teams 
len ratingfive It s really really good I enjoyed alot and connected with colleagues 
len ratingfive Thank you very much 
len ratingfive What would we do without Teams during this time of all employees in a work from home mode 
len ratingfive With Teams or normal cadence of interactions continues via video 
len ratingfive We run our business via Teams 
len ratingfive It is a fabulous tool 
len ratingtwo I can t open a recoded video through the app 
len ratingtwo Please fix the problem ASAP 
len ratingtwo It shows only a black screen whenever I click 
len ratingone yes t
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone my battery drains every time I use this app my phone heats up even when i m not using it due to this app and there are glitches every now and then when I m in a meeting 
len ratingone Used to work perfectly now is just a mess 
len ratingfour I really don t get any responses on subjects posted 
len ratingfour Or maybe I don t know how to look it up 
len ratingone Ew disgusting HHJJHHGEHAVGD i hate school
len ratingthree Very good tool 
len ratingthree But very heavy on devices with limited CPU RAM
len ratingone  no cap 
len ratingthree Please let us lock background choices in video so we don t have to select them with each video conference 
len ratingthree Let me organize my uploaded background and prioritize them higher than your built in options 
len ratingthree Let me hide or delete video backgrounds 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree the app is nice but the freezing up and restarts really complicate important meetings 
len ratingfive Teams is a great tool for My organization to conduct virtual meeting and Teleconfrence
len ratingthree Would be better if more people can join and you actually can see all in meeting screens also sometimes the desktop does not always work properly the phone works great but overall i love the app really nice software
len ratingone  It s ass kids do not like the app please remove off of the App Store
len ratingone Deveria ter uma op o de diminuir o udio dos professores e dos moleques com microfone de padaria 
len ratingone Da nem pra ficar em uma call em paz 
len ratingone  When we are trying to join in iPad I am unable to join unless the organizer is in
len ratingone Have to delete doesn t work
len ratingone  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
len ratingfive Great product flawless communications 
len ratingone  Primero no hay fondo en ipad Segundo las llamadas no sirven el teams dw mu computadora esta lento pero lo demas rapido Tercero cuando entrego algo aparce que no entregue Cuarto es ilegal porque miran chats privados y eso es invasion a la privasidaf Quinto nadamas aparecen personas y no todo el salon Sexto zoom sirve mejor
len ratingfive Great tool I wish it was easier to do polling 
len ratingfive I am used to telegram which makes polling so easy
len ratingone This app is the worst it doesn t let you get on from different devices because your teachers then think you cheat like wth 
len ratingone An then it s hard to get around like these kids don t know what to do 
len ratingone It doesn t help us learn
len ratingtwo Pain to set up but convenient after that 
len ratingthree To activate when going back from idle 
len ratingfive We use Teams in our company 
len ratingfive It is great to have a highly functional mobile version 
len ratingfive Really works seamlessly
len ratingfive I really do not like Outlook and using Teams and trying to get others to follow along has reduced the clutter of one and two word email responses 
len ratingfive I would love to see the ability to set up a template for project work 
len ratingfour On a call yesterday it was very garbled 
len ratingfour It was just myself and another 
len ratingfour Y voice was clear to her but her voice was not for me
len ratingfive Collaboration
len ratingtwo Am I the only one who s having issues viewing recorded meetings 
len ratingtwo I don t have problems on the desktop but when I need to review on the go the video plays a black screen on the app I can hear everything but I can t see anything 
len ratingfive The App is great 
len ratingfive Setting up a meeting is effortless 
len ratingfive Joining any meeting is also hassle free 
len ratingfour This app is great almost does everything my laptop does 
len ratingfour BUT a huge but it NEEDS to have email notifications when plugged into Apple car play I have no idea when I get emails driving and that can be the difference in getting or loosing a million dollar deal and many other business oriented things enough said 
len ratingfour Simple sound on the car speakers so I can pull over safely would be a huge help 
len ratingfour Thanks hope to see this in the next update 
len ratingfour If it s there as an option and I m not seeing PLEASE inform me 
len ratingfive Great way for our whole company to stay connected while workin remotely 
len ratingfive The chat and video meetings feature has allowed our company to continue to work remotely with a high level of efficiency 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive One good thing COVID brought to collaboration 
len ratingthree Need the ability to have more people on video chat 
len ratingtwo I removed the vibrate option on the notifications yet it still vibrates with each notification not nice that the settings don t work as they should
len ratingone I have been having video playback issues for the past two weeks 
len ratingone I ve had to delete and download this app multiple times and it still won t play a recorded video back for me 
len ratingone Also it tells me on some of my recorded videos that I am unauthorized to view the video and that I should create a stream account 
len ratingone This is wrong 
len ratingone It was working just fine and now nothing works and it freezes on me 
len ratingfive Love the app and would love it more if I had options on my Apple Watch like mute and unmute on a meeting similar to what Webex offers 
len ratingone A with many other Microsoft applications it doesn t work and doesn t need to exist 
len ratingone Slack and zoom do work 
len ratingone Use those instead 
len ratingone I also very much dislike that when adding my phone number I was told that it would be to secure my account but afterwards I was told anyone could use the number to find me 
len ratingfive Need more functionality on the phone version Background photos chat features larger gallery view etc etc Also need the opportunity to be able to make a recording and mute other participants when needed
len ratingfive Muy buena Ap muy moderna facil de utilizar 
len ratingfive Amazing apppffff
len ratingfour Sometimes it is difficult to find contacts 
len ratingfour The suggestion list often excludes people unless an exact character sequence matches 
len ratingfour Inviting external people is also difficult 
len ratingfour Sometimes they are in a waiting room and sometimes they are no where to be found 
len ratingfour I need an easier way to make sure that external entities can participate in our teams 
len ratingone Multiple updates and password changes required every time I use it 
len ratingone Not dependable at all 
len ratingone  Hi there We re sorry to hear about your issue you re seeing 
len ratingone Did your issue just start happening or is this something you ve seen in the past 
len ratingfour I really wish I could customize this app I d love for it to be pink lol
len ratingtwo iPhone app unable to unmute chats that are muted 
len ratingtwo Uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn t work
len ratingfour Being able to delete chats should be an option 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive My coworkers and I are connected 
len ratingtwo It s very inconvenient that I can t sync the Posts between the laptop version and the iPhone version 
len ratingtwo I restarted both versions but no improvement 
len ratingtwo Please fix it 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive I like using this App while I ve been working from home
len ratingfive This app is an amazing app for meeting up with friends online and keeping In contact with classmates or coworkers 
len ratingfive Need to clearly see conflicts when scheduling meetings 
len ratingfive Why can t I see what I am typing when writing this review
len ratingthree Need to link outlook e mail to Teams
len ratingfour I only wish that I could get into my meetings directly from the app and not have to have first opened it on my computer 
len ratingfive So seamless that it s just a great tool for any collaborative work v cons and group calls
len ratingone Garage
len ratingthree Slows down
len ratingfive I really love the Teams Meeting Program 
len ratingfive Best virtual meetings platform I ve used 
len ratingfour I love the app 
len ratingfour Could have been stars but I can t switch to use the back camera on the phone during the call or meeting since the front camera is broken 
len ratingfour I like that I can be the n the same meeting from multiple devices 
len ratingfour Makes mobility work from home a breeze
len ratingthree Why not on iPad 
len ratingthree Why are we still looking at faces 
len ratingfour Please provide a reply option for each message
len ratingfive As the Director of IT I ve been preaching Teams for almost years now and if there is any good thing that has come out of this terribly pandemic Teams would be one of them 
len ratingfive We deployed Teams in a matter of days and had over locations connected and using the application for our Covid calls and many clinical calls 
len ratingfive True a blessing for us and those we serve 
len ratingone Things are very hard to find
len ratingthree This app always lags when writing messages and sometimes even crashes it sometimes never upload any work images 
len ratingone  I hate taking class
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone I ve been using the app for work for about years and now I am unable to get it to work 
len ratingone As soon as I try to open it I get a MSALE domain error and it says the operation cannot be completed 
len ratingone I uninstalled and reinstalled with no luck 
len ratingone  Hello there we re sorry to hear about this issue 
len ratingone To help resolve this issue please try closing the app and signing into another M app like Outlook then try signing into Teams 
len ratingone We re working to resolve this issue as soon as possible 
len ratingfive Easy Professiou
len ratingfive Great tool to work with 
len ratingfive I don t have to use my desktop all the time 
len ratingfive Great tool of communication for on work and off work 
len ratingfive Quick and easy to use It keeps me in contact with my colleagues any time of the day 
len ratingone  The app was put together nicely but I used it for school 
len ratingone I hate school 
len ratingone So I m not gonna give a good review 
len ratingfive It help us learn in this school work now
len ratingfive One of the best app i have come across so far 
len ratingfive Teams have it all 
len ratingfive We can literally manage all our work requirement in teams 
len ratingfive Great in the app 
len ratingfive Sounds clear 
len ratingfive Emojis and gifs work on here too 
len ratingthree Not as user friendly as the old Lync or Skype was 
len ratingone It takes so long to load 
len ratingfive I am with a different company now that utilizes teams like no other company I have worked for 
len ratingfive They utilize all the features and it is truly fantastic 
len ratingfive  This keeps us linked and sync d 
len ratingthree I really like the chat functions 
len ratingthree Great for getting a hold of team member on call messaging or video 
len ratingthree The schedule aspect is AWFUL 
len ratingthree Not intuitive hard to create mass team schedules and no ability to add to calendar 
len ratingthree Delete this option and make something better if you want this to be a selling point 
len ratingthree Otherwise stick with chat and team functions because that is GREAT 
len ratingone  Just terrible
len ratingone  Title says it all 
len ratingone Dud app
len ratingthree Working from home now over mos 
len ratingthree I have seen progress and improvements along the way 
len ratingthree Still having issue with Audio during larger meetings 
len ratingthree Should we be turning all video and Audio off except for the person presenting 
len ratingone I primarily downloaded this app in my phone to have video call meetings in my workplace 
len ratingone The calendar tab never loads and the app support option doesn t let me contact a team member for help with this issue instead it only lets me search possible solutions to problems similar yet not the same to the one I have 
len ratingfour Teams is a nice solution but still missing some key features that Slack has such as scheduling reminders editing and custom emojis 
len ratingfour Otherwise really functional tho 
len ratingone The only reason I have this ridiculous app it s because my work makes is download it 
len ratingone Garbage
len ratingfive This app has been a huge plus particularly since we cover a larger geographic area with multiple sites 
len ratingfive Since COVID restrictions began we have been dependent on TEAMS to help us keep our team members engaged productive and supported 
len ratingfive We could not have accomplished this without TEAMS 
len ratingthree This app is getting there but lacks to many features available on the PC version quite honestly this world is growing more mobile and laptops are truly getting to be more and more desktop machine 
len ratingthree I and most of my colleagues travel only with our mobile devices of which the iPad and iPhone are by far the mobile devices of choice 
len ratingthree It is time for Microsoft to give better functionality of Teams for these mobile devices 
len ratingone I was using Team chat for work and it was great 
len ratingone Recently a couple days ago it stopped working and kept giving me an error when I try to go into the app 
len ratingone Keeps telling me to restart the app and now I can t use it in mobile 
len ratingone Please reach out to me I need help 
len ratingone  Hi there We re sorry to hear you re having trouble with the app 
len ratingone Could you please provide any additional details around any errors you re seeing so we can look into it 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfour It s truly like a skype on steroids haha 
len ratingfour Awesome features such as plenty of gifs stickers etc 
len ratingfour just one complaint you cannot delete chat threads 
len ratingfour It s like they remain there forever 
len ratingfour It only allows you to delete messages you have sent and that is individually 
len ratingfour As soon as they fix that it will totally be stars 
len ratingone  Jacob please stop asking to be a trolly on every call then proceeding to bend yourself to where your arms and legs are sticking up and holding a whole table with good and drinks on them and duck taping mechanically powered wheels that move whenever you clench your jaw shut and playing the Harry Potter audio Anything from the trolly dears every time you roll into view 
len ratingone I don t want you to get hurt 
len ratingtwo  Locations not accurate at all 
len ratingtwo Also everyone in my family group shows different locations 
len ratingtwo This should have been worked out before release 
len ratingfour So far Teams has been great 
len ratingfour Only suggestion would be to include files shared in a group chat to be also included in the file location of that group 
len ratingfour That would make it easier to find later on 
len ratingfive Es un pr ctica y de f cil utilizaci n 
len ratingone Whenever I join a meeting there is no button to turn on video 
len ratingone Would not recommend until they fix this 
len ratingfive I can make Teams with my friends and my teachers 
len ratingfive I m a girl and that s work too much to me with only years I already know how to use 
len ratingfive The teams app and platform make communicating with remote teams a breeze 
len ratingfive We are a farming operation spread out across hundreds of miles Teams allows us to feel like we are meeting in person while also storing files chats and connecting to our existing emails system 
len ratingfive Teams make meetings and communication easy 
len ratingthree  Shuts off when I click on it 
len ratingthree Can t see material 
len ratingone We started using Shifts during the pandemic and while the desktop version works well the app does not seem to sync well and only displays some shifts or some days 
len ratingone A lot of missing info
len ratingfive Very nice it enables me too stay connected to Teams without being at my computer
len ratingfive This App allows me to multitask and be more mobile while working and socializing with friends 
len ratingfive Teams enables the contact to get our team back to collaboration
len ratingfive With teleworking this has been great
len ratingone My quarantine couldn t get any worse 
len ratingone Latest update signed me out and won t let me back in 
len ratingone Worked this am then updated and now I can t get in no matter what I do 
len ratingone Was weird cuz I could log in on the Microsoft mobile site but when i launched the Teams app from the Microsoft site it still was trying to make me login and then didn t allow me to 
len ratingone I was eventually able to get in but had to sign out of my session on my work vpn desktop 
len ratingone And during that time it unsubscribed me to of my groups 
len ratingone Error i received just said Sign in error 
len ratingone Please try again Hi there Can you comment more on any error you re seeing 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone  No
len ratingfive Work for a large Corp and love it 
len ratingfour Thus far Teams is an acceptable app for collaboration 
len ratingfour For group calls using the iPhone app a suggestion would be to allow participants to view videos of all participants rather than just total 
len ratingthree This product is good but could be so much better 
len ratingthree Only concurrent video streams at once in iPad is frustrating and feels behind the times 
len ratingthree Other things like the host not being able to mute or unmute specific all guest 
len ratingthree Many times it is necessary mute or unmute guests do to background noise 
len ratingthree These are just a couple of the things frustrating with Teams 
len ratingthree When I have large group meetings I still got to Zoom 
len ratingfive Incredible 
len ratingfive The best company collaboration and communication tool
len ratingfive Perfect software to communicate
len ratingthree On my device iPad mini it has lags and latency 
len ratingtwo This week I have had lots of connecting issues and freezing of the application
len ratingfive Honestly could t live without this app 
len ratingfive Our company is no longer using Skype and I ve never been happier 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft 
len ratingthree Why didn t windows put windows capability into their new app 
len ratingfive Teams is great for collaboration and group discussions 
len ratingfive I love being able to reference information after the fact by attaching documents to discussions 
len ratingfive So easy 
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive Better than Skype
len ratingone  Latest update signed me out and won t let me back in 
len ratingone Worked this am then updated and now I can t get in no matter what I do Hi there Can you comment more on any error you re seeing 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone After reading many articles about captions being added in March my family and the various members of tech teams are unable to access this necessary accessibility tool on iPad MacBook or iMac 
len ratingone We can neither access captioning through the app nor through internet directly 
len ratingone No captions simply means that people with hearing loss ADD ADHD language processing challenges etc cannot participate in meetings on MS Teams 
len ratingfive It is well organized our office s communication almost replace the email 
len ratingfive It also add the chat video call many linked apps office suite best of all it has most affordable pricing 
len ratingone  Unfortunately there is an extremely noticable delay when a user takes control of your system 
len ratingone I would love to rate teams a star but I would like this issue to be addressed first
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive hands down the best program and App I have used 
len ratingfive My favorite part is the option to make a black screen 
len ratingfive DCM
len ratingfive Great service I use teams both at work as well as in my personal life 
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingtwo  Omg so there s this new darn upgrade that came today and it s not letting me in the meeting I fricking lost my goddam exam because of this bull s ht
len ratingone que le quiten el internet
len ratingone  J
len ratingfive I love that you can set up a do not disturb schedule 
len ratingfive I am not entirely clear on which presence status gets shown though 
len ratingfive Is it desktop or mobile or last to set 
len ratingfive One request that I have is to be able to use different sounds for chats and mentions 
len ratingone  I hate this app because I am a student
len ratingone I hate this 
len ratingfive We use this at work and home for EVERYTHING 
len ratingfive Kudos to the features and reliability Mobile app is a real plus and easy to use to integrate with office or home based team 
len ratingone  I had to use this for my classes and I h it so much bc I h school so ya 
len ratingfive I used to use slack for collaboration with my coworkers but Microsoft has really stepped up their game 
len ratingfive This app is all I need to stay connected with my team on the go 
len ratingtwo Connectivity and calls keep dropping
len ratingfive  It s aight I guess 
len ratingthree It is too new for a good assessment 
len ratingthree I do not like that I cannot set a different default font that is bigger 
len ratingfive I use teams for work and it is super helpful 
len ratingfive I love the feature of being able to do video meetings screenshare calls within the app 
len ratingfive  cherriez lt 
len ratingtwo  So when I first got this app to learn better it was ok but then someone hacked my friend so yay I tried to help
len ratingfour Phone audio is grayed out forcing me to use computer audio which is problem when my internet is slow 
len ratingone I would give this starts If I could 
len ratingfive  I love using this app because I can finally communicate easily with teachers and classmates 
len ratingfive The ultimate tool for collaboration 
len ratingfive This app provides so much functionality and is incredibly helpful 
len ratingfive I use this app daily 
len ratingthree  I downloaded this app a few months ago due to the covid 
len ratingthree And my secondary school is now using it 
len ratingthree Whenever there is a meeting it glitches a lot and its really hard to listen to what the host is saying 
len ratingthree But overall I think everything else is good 
len ratingthree I think as for the meeting you could maybe install a gallery view or something 
len ratingthree So that it is easier to see everyone else 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone Doesn t honor background processing settings and drains my iPad battery 
len ratingfive Amazing app thats helps organize all your projects and incorporates great features from multiple different apps 
len ratingfour Unless I m missing something it d be great if the calendar gave options for appt reminders 
len ratingfour Other than that the app has been great
len ratingone  Disgusting 
len ratingone Ruined my whole QUARANTINE 
len ratingfive Teams is epic and unparalleled 
len ratingfive Way to go Microsoft 
len ratingthree It s great 
len ratingthree I only don t like that you can t see users status in Outlook email 
len ratingone  If you heard the thing on tik tok about removing apps then yep you know what I m doing 
len ratingfour Hello I ve been having challenge to use Teams with multiple users at the same time 
len ratingfour My employer and my client both use Teams however we are only able to use one account on Teams would be really great if you can enable multiple user logins into the application
len ratingfive This app has been incredibly helpful during this quarantine time 
len ratingfive The response time is so quick 
len ratingfive The reliability is fantastic 
len ratingone  I had to make a very very big poo and it wouldn t come out so I downloaded your app to tell my friends about my troubles but no one would answer and then I realized I have no friends so then I got sad and I swallowed my phone 
len ratingone Two days later I pooped it out and now I have not one not two but radiation infections 
len ratingone Not only that but now my phone is broken and everyone thinks I have mental problems because of this app 
len ratingone Now I am sad too because your app made me realize that I don t have friends 
len ratingone  attention you are not our trollies students are allowed to take to help you move
len ratingfive Can t wait to switch company wide
len ratingfive No comparison best app for video calls and team communication 
len ratingfive Wouldn t be able to have as smooth of work flow without it
len ratingfive Love love love teams 
len ratingone I love teams and regularly use it as a communication tool for work but my disabled mom has pointed out several major accessibility flaws that seems to have no solution they are listed below 
len ratingone Captioning on mobile is not adjustable nor is the text size 
len ratingone The app seems to completely ignore Apple native accessibility settings and has a one size fits all approach to text and caption size 
len ratingone My mom DOES NOT CARE if the captions cover the faces of those speaking in her meetings she can t hear them without it 
len ratingone Whis I personally am able to use Teams seamlessly across device people who rely on assistive technologies are being left behind unless they use the desktop version which isn t always possible in this high speed world 
len ratingone Anyone with a visual or hearing impairment should use with caution 
len ratingone Microsoft I hope you see these and make improvements 
len ratingone You re a huge company you should be accessible on everyone 
len ratingone It crashes all the time broken piece of trash
len ratingfour  Why not on iPad 
len ratingfour Why are we still looking at faces 
len ratingfive good application recommend for business
len ratingone  Kk
len ratingthree  I only use Teams for work and the app is fine for me 
len ratingthree However I don t like that I cannot delete some of these messages in Chat 
len ratingthree Serious upgrade needed because that part is annoying 
len ratingone Garbage app
len ratingtwo So for class I had this installed on my phone so I can see my school work 
len ratingtwo I had all notifications on to make sure I knew if I had any kind of work 
len ratingtwo But the problem is when I was getting my assignments I wouldn t get the notifications 
len ratingtwo I don t know if it was a glitch or maybe my phone was just being stupid but I don t know 
len ratingtwo I tried deleting it and reinstalling it but that did nothing 
len ratingtwo Other than that the app is helpful and runs smoothly
len ratingone  Inserting formatted code blocks is an exercise in tedium 
len ratingone  When you mention someone it does not automatically insert a space after the user token unlike every other messaging app out there 
len ratingone  it hides text content when you embed an image but will show the next text reply 
len ratingone  setting yourself as away or busy does not pause notifications why is there no snooze function 
len ratingone This is absolutely maddening 
len ratingone  there are often reflow issues when switching from landscape to portrait on both the iPad and iPhone 
len ratingone  strange and inconsistent issues with the clipboard 
len ratingone  Inserting an emoji requires four steps 
len ratingone  It s an absolute joy when switching from another app and you start typing only to have the text input reflow below your keyboard 
len ratingone  slow buggy and often times inconsistent web link previews 
len ratingone  sluggish UI and context switching 
len ratingone I m on a iPad Pro 
len ratingone Please fix this stuff 
len ratingone Everyone else gets at least percent of that stuff right y all don t even seem to try 
len ratingone Lol 
len ratingone This is nonesense
len ratingthree The three star rating is based on audio video quality 
len ratingthree This could be affected by overloaded internet lately otherwise Teams seems very easy and accessible for many skill levels 
len ratingthree Features like screen sharing are very easy and well integrated in the experience 
len ratingfour Love teams but use zoom when we have larger conference calls 
len ratingfour  people 
len ratingone Not work in ipad
len ratingone Weird ppl text me and I can t Block Them
len ratingfive Excellent to communicate through 
len ratingfive Please integrate your Skype technology into this App 
len ratingfive If you do that you will be way ahead of Zoom 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Thank you for this app
len ratingfour Buena herramienta de trabajo en el mbito profesional la App iOS m vil podr a mejor con m s funcionalidades 
len ratingfour Would love to have To Do and a time tracking feature
len ratingfive You can do everything you want on this app and the merge with mobile makes it the ultimate efficiency performer 
len ratingfive So resourceful for any type of remote communication 
len ratingfive Why email or Skype or mobile while you can Teams 
len ratingfour Switched to it at right time 
len ratingfour Lots of improvements added features 
len ratingfour Downside 
len ratingfour Chat and Team conversations somewhat confusing 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Easy to use simple functions save posts feature is a godsend 
len ratingfive Better on the mobile than computer in my opinion 
len ratingfive Will definitely recommend to friends 
len ratingfive It s very useful tool you need to have 
len ratingone  It don t dang work
len ratingfour I would have given stars if more participants could be viewed on the screen at once 
len ratingfive Bueno
len ratingfour  For the most part MS Teams is a great application with lots of features 
len ratingfour However I have two complaints 
len ratingfour  Unlike it desktop version you don t have custom background calls for meetings 
len ratingfour  When in you in the chat overview window it doesn t report the person correct status until you into that chat session 
len ratingfour That second point is very annoying since you have to go into each chat session to get updated statuses 
len ratingfive Having the ability to use the app to keep in touch with people at the office is a great tool 
len ratingfive As it provides a dedicated platform it is more efficient than texting 
len ratingfour The teams app is great 
len ratingfour It is very user friendly 
len ratingfour One thing for improvement is that if I answer a call on the app I can t figure out how to get into that call on the desktop to see screens 
len ratingone If i could give zero stars I would
len ratingfour Need an Apple Watch version does that I can get updates directly to the watch when away from my iPhone 
len ratingtwo  I am disappointed that in iPad the virtual background it is not advidable
len ratingfour Still some way to go like much better Outlook integration to maximize the MS ecosystem 
len ratingfive It s free and works well
len ratingfive I am using Teams without any issues whatsoever on my Mac iPhone and Windows laptop 
len ratingfive Bye bye Zoom Skype Slack and PGI 
len ratingfive The ease of use of any professional app on mobile has never been this easy 
len ratingfive The sync is seamless and there is nothing to complain at this point of time 
len ratingfive Makes life easy 
len ratingtwo Yeah tha app itself is OK It s another exercise in mediocrity from Microsoft 
len ratingtwo You would think with all their brain power they would be able to rip off the best features of all the better chat software programs 
len ratingtwo My main irritation is that I frequently am commuting in my car and I have my phone hooked up to my Apple CarPlay to listen in on Meetings and it s been really buggy lately 
len ratingtwo It frequently disconnect the call 
len ratingtwo It wasn t doing that before 
len ratingtwo I m hoping this last update fixes these issues 
len ratingone App is okay the interface is so complicated you practically need training to use it 
len ratingone Typical Microsoft 
len ratingone Flashback to the s when people took classes and received MS Office certificates 
len ratingone It s the s 
len ratingone So frustrating and counterintuitive 
len ratingone Thankful for Google and Apple 
len ratingfive We changed our infrastructure for chats a year ago to teams it was an almost seem less transition for us during the COVID to use it for meeting and presentations 
len ratingfour Very comprehensive and useful 
len ratingfour I m still relatively new to it but so far it s been working out great 
len ratingthree Audio is very weak almost every call or meeting has an issue hearing and it s frustrating trying share screens if you use more than one monitor 
len ratingthree Not happy with the platform
len ratingfive The one feature that is very useful is when I add an external user it will automatically send the message to their Skype 
len ratingfive Great software amp service no problems encountered 
len ratingthree It works great but I give a star because I m not able to permanently delete messages 
len ratingone Please allow users to decrease volume further on Teams audio calls 
len ratingone The current minimum audio level on Teams calls is PAINFULLY loud 
len ratingone Please unlock audio controls so volume can be lowered incrementally to zero 
len ratingone Not very productive 
len ratingone  How long does it take a Microsoft team engineers to add the feature to add customized backdrop change loop video clip and picture to the phone app 
len ratingone Never 
len ratingone Come on guys it s not that hard to code and it s an important feature to have 
len ratingone Any other group video chat apps out there can do that already 
len ratingone Do you guys really want to wait till the Pandemic is over and then add this feature when no one uses Team anymore 
len ratingone How about the limitation to see only faces come on
len ratingfive Amazing app for work
len ratingfive Thanks MSFT for making an office tool That is easy to use and productive 
len ratingfive Improve the supportability for ARM as well
len ratingone Teams on the lastest iPad Os keeps crashing on launch
len ratingfive Skype Skype
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive Great to use
len ratingone  Nose que poner
len ratingone Invited to join teams meetings from a business customer 
len ratingone Their license not mine 
len ratingone I am solely attempting to join their meeting 
len ratingone Have determined that this is impossible using the iPad app 
len ratingone It will not let me join no matter what I do 
len ratingone Attempted to sign in with email that has the invite my business doesn t have a paid contract so I cannot create an account 
len ratingone Attempted to sign in with other emails cannot access the meeting I was invited to 
len ratingone Completely worthless app 
len ratingone This app is trash 
len ratingone It is so laggy and glitchy 
len ratingone I HATE TEAMS 
len ratingthree I would like to be able to see more of my calendar
len ratingfive Teams works consistently well as an IM app and as a video or audio conference app 
len ratingfive Blows Skype out of the water 
len ratingfive Highly recommend the switch 
len ratingfive Have to find a way to be able to mark up during a meeting
len ratingone Tiene mal desenfoque de audio
len ratingthree I don t like having my teams voice calls showing in my iphones phone app recent call lost
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive So seamless 
len ratingfive I m in meeting that require minimal participation and I can go for a jog or around the corner to pick up my smoothie 
len ratingfive MS Teams is great 
len ratingfive Hell MS is great 
len ratingfive Great collaboration app if you have office and one drive 
len ratingfive Microsoft is improving it all the time too
len ratingfour Teams is a great way collaborate and host meetings with large companies the only suggestion I would have is if you use it on your cell check it often because you don t receive notifications
len ratingfive While in presentation mode 
len ratingfive My presentation freezes and won t advance at times 
len ratingone Doesn t work 
len ratingone Always just says connection failed and disconnects
len ratingthree Teams is just murdering battery life 
len ratingthree  in less than an hour on an iPad Pro dedicated to Teams 
len ratingfive I enjoy it the teams app 
len ratingfive I love the ability to have it on multiple platforms while on the go 
len ratingfive I love teams 
len ratingfive For me the biggest advantage is the subtitles powered by AI 
len ratingfive Cisco and Zoom have not even attempted to make their platforms accessible using AI so it s frustrating that people companies use their platforms vs a google or Microsoft one that has been dedicated to creating accessible platforms 
len ratingfive It s frustrating that those companies even offer non accessible web services 
len ratingfive It is unethical 
len ratingtwo As an educator Teams is a major headache 
len ratingtwo Students are able to see each other s ID numbers 
len ratingtwo The conversations are not easy to organize 
len ratingtwo There is a major learning curve for students using this 
len ratingtwo Google classroom is an easier format and platform for both students and teachers 
len ratingfive Im watching you Microsoft 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Did you know water is wet 
len ratingone Teams is always force close on My iPhone XR for weeks Why 
len ratingone When I open the Teams iOS app on an iPad Mini it shows the Teams logo and nothing else 
len ratingone No login prompt 
len ratingone I literally can t do anything with it on this device 
len ratingone Tried reinstalling no luck 
len ratingone Works on my other iOS devices iPhone and iPad Pro 
len ratingone Got a push notification to open the app to continue receiving notifications 
len ratingone Stuck on splash screen 
len ratingone Recently changed my pw 
len ratingone I tried deleting and redownloading the app still stuck on the splash screen 
len ratingone Completely unusable 
len ratingfour Love the interface and flexibility of Teams 
len ratingfour Internal apps don t behave too well on the mobile app though 
len ratingtwo I love the options in the app but the problem is the video the quality is not good and it keeps lagging now many of you might say it s a network problem but I don t think it is 
len ratingtwo This app is great for work but has bad quality
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Helpful to personalize to my preferences 
len ratingfive One of the few apps that has been very helpful at work especially teleworking 
len ratingfive I like how I can communicate from my laptop and in my phone and able to exchange files 
len ratingone  Ew
len ratingtwo I keep seeing news articles about how all the updates Microsoft is making to this app gives them more capabilities than Zoom for people working from home 
len ratingtwo How bout those of us working from home who are Microsoft customers but our parent companies don t have the commercial subscription 
len ratingtwo We are still out here using Zoom because our paid Microsoft subscriptions don t include this access 
len ratingtwo  Teams worked great on my Android devices 
len ratingtwo Why isn t there a GIF option on Apple 
len ratingone Los estudiantes necesitamos la opci n de levantar la mano en nuestros tel fonos sino no podemos responder las preguntas que hacen los profesores 
len ratingone We need the hand up option in our phones because when teachers make questions we can t say anything
len ratingfive Awesome source to be able to participate in Navy Reserve Drill Weekends 
len ratingfive Feeling grateful 
len ratingone  i had to use this for school cause of covid and it was hell but i also never did my work and i have to do it all now
len ratingone I want my schoolwork gone honestly
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingone  I m f a i l i n g s o m e o n e b u r n t h i s a p p t o t h e g r o u n d 
len ratingfive Atendimento muito bom e tima qualidade atende o necess rio para o trabalho
len ratingone I downloaded this app 
len ratingone I really was looking forward to using this 
len ratingone I think it will be a great tool for my business 
len ratingone But there is a problem if you make a error in your set up such as your Company Name or anything else you will basically have to delete the account and set up an entire new account which will put your business at risk and starting all over My concern is if I decide to use this apps for the next several years and i build my entire business around it and if I notice an error I possibly made or a colleague error I would potentially loose everything and force to start all over because Microsoft claim there is no work around in fixing it unless I purchase a full subscription to me this is a scam I m looking for other options now and will not be using it Maybe Apple will have something in place
len ratingfour I really think this app is amazing for online school 
len ratingfour My school used it and I never had any connection issues or crashes 
len ratingfour However if you forget about an assignment it doesn t notify you 
len ratingfour You have to wait for your teachers to let you know then be screwed unless they re nice enough for you to turn it in late 
len ratingfour Also if you turn it in late several of my teachers have stated that they don t get notified when you do 
len ratingfour Finally most of the apps built into Teams work well but some wouldn t open but it s still an amazing app 
len ratingfour I also hated online school but because that s a dumb reason to hate on an app that didn t have any part to why I didn t leave stars 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfour The app works great and keeps me up to date when I step away from my laptop 
len ratingfour The desktop version however has extreme latencies when multiple users are attempting to access post at one time 
len ratingfour Overall a positive experience with minimal frustrations 
len ratingfive Teams app on iphone much better than heavy app on desktop
len ratingfive Due to COVID We have had to work from home TEAMS has helped my co workers and I keep in touch 
len ratingfive We have meetings with the video call option we communicate back and fourth 
len ratingfive I am satisfied with the app 
len ratingfive This is Hansen
len ratingfive Through work and have to say the calling texting and of course everything else it already does to track projects is great 
len ratingfive The sound quality of good too
len ratingfive Love
len ratingfive I LOVE TEAMS 
len ratingfive I am currently working from home so I am using Teams all day to keep in touch with my managers and coworkers 
len ratingfive If it weren t for Teams I might not talk to anyone within my company 
len ratingfive I love how simple it is to use and how many great features it has 
len ratingfive It has made working from home a dream 
len ratingfour My review is regarding the help section 
len ratingfour I feel that additional content and detail should be added 
len ratingfour For example I am trying to figure out how to delete conversations from chats but I don t see where this problem is addressed 
len ratingfive The application has allowed me to stay connected to my co workers while not being able to be in the office
len ratingone  So laggy 
len ratingone Assignments take so long to load 
len ratingone When you post a message it sends x 
len ratingone The meeting quality is horrible 
len ratingthree Have used the desktop version for months and it is a great tool 
len ratingthree My first experience with the app on my iPad didn t go so well 
len ratingthree I have an iPad Pro th Gen running IOS 
len ratingthree The audio mic work fine through the iPad but when I connect my Bose QC earbuds with an Apple USB C adapter Teams doesn t recognize them and the audio continues through the iPad 
len ratingfour  The teams app is really awesome and all but it needs background changes for I pad please update it like that
len ratingfive Our engineering firm is working from home due to covid 
len ratingfive We have many group meetings and individual calls 
len ratingfive The ability to share screens and documents has been a life saver 
len ratingfour If Teams kept the alternative tennants in the background live when switching accounts this would be perfect 
len ratingthree Great app 
len ratingthree But evidently if you have a video call and hold your phone in portrait mode the camera zooms way in 
len ratingthree It looks fine on my side but it s zoomed way in for the others 
len ratingone Fists then it s sooooo glitchy and it freezez I don t know why my cheep school uses this app that s trash
len ratingone  Gave me brain damage
len ratingone  Me no like 
len ratingone TikTok br ock
len ratingone If you already have a personal Microsoft account you can t sign up for Teams for free 
len ratingone However Microsoft notes on their website to sign up via incognito mode from your browser then you can create an account OR create another brand new Microsoft account 
len ratingone I went incognito signed up with my existing subscribed email 
len ratingone However you can t use it to sign into the App 
len ratingone It s let s got though the steps to login but it doesn t let you use the app 
len ratingone Obviously Microsoft rushed into this 
len ratingone What a mess 
len ratingone It s so sloppy 
len ratingone Competitors such as slack are miles ahead and will continue to grab more customers during COVID because the offer a clear and clean sign up free process and later if you require more features you pay 
len ratingone Microsoft on the other hand offers Teams for free for non existing customers and punishes their existing personal subscribers 
len ratingthree Ok so like i added another account to my teams so we can help each other out with our school work but I am trying to delete her account off my teams and I don t know how to and I only have my iPhone no other electronics Can you please help me
len ratingfive C g m kh ng c g m c g 
len ratingone It s not their fault that we have to use this for school but I m mad that they were this smart to make an app like this gt 
len ratingtwo Teams is good for casual work between colleagues but the second you have a semi important meeting it decides to self destruct 
len ratingtwo I would not recommend using it as the sole meetings app 
len ratingtwo Have a backup plan
len ratingfive Best collaboration experience hands down 
len ratingfive You can use mobile for audio and laptop for video effortlessly 
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingone I am unable to scroll in ToDo lists or in edit ToDo s 
len ratingone Extremely limited functionality due to this 
len ratingone Also no graphs are working 
len ratingone This is on iPad and iPhone 
len ratingfive Teams work really well
len ratingfour Great app but my classmate had some problems on IOS like he couldn t see the screen when my teacher shared his screen I m on I pad sometimes I go on PC either then that cool app 
len ratingfive GE Appliances has been using Teams to allow us to Work From Home WFH 
len ratingfive It is a very app laptop communication tool 
len ratingfive When CV is behind us our work will likely still heavily use Teams 
len ratingthree Great tool but with one very annoying bug feature 
len ratingthree When we are connected to meeting and phone is locked by pressing HW button meeting is disconnected 
len ratingthree Its very annoying especially while attending meeting when we need phones locked just listening 
len ratingfive I am so happy my company is using MS teams 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingone This application stopped working on my iPhone max with the last update 
len ratingone The program runs in the background but the GUI displays for a second then disappears 
len ratingone I still get notifications but can not see them in the app 
len ratingone Has been additional updates and the app still does not work 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingtwo Microsoft teams worked for the first time I opened the app the secound time I opened it it crashed repeatedly when I tried to open it 
len ratingfive MS Teams has been the shining star of the Coronavirus pandemic 
len ratingfive It has been the primary communications tool of many of my clients 
len ratingfive It is far more stable than the products of competitors and easy to use 
len ratingfive I use this app a lot for work and I simply love it 
len ratingfive It s a great collaborative tool
len ratingfive Teams ability to consolidate various methods of information transfer over the internet makes it a real power tool to communicate activities in real time
len ratingone  It s very crappy because it will always freeze on you 
len ratingone I wish I could put zero stars
len ratingone I was asked for my user name and password three separate times 
len ratingone Each time it appeared to work and then told me I had to go do something else to setup further 
len ratingone The login then tried to redirect to Skype for me to create a meeting 
len ratingone It s like Teams was trying to tell me it knows it doesn t work and I should just use Skype instead 
len ratingfive Thanks to teams I got to finish school talk to my friends in quarantine and had the best time 
len ratingfive Teams is a great app to have in my opinion everybody should have it 
len ratingfive However there are some glitches and internet related problems 
len ratingfive I found out that teams is having less problems than before and I know the creators are working to fixing it 
len ratingfive Anyway Teams is a great app and you need to try it out 
len ratingfive P S 
len ratingfive it might take a little time and trouble to sign up 
len ratingfour Have you seen that it does most everything the desktop version does 
len ratingfour Would prefer not to have to open OneNote but see as a webpage but it forces you to open a separate app 
len ratingfour Connection does appear seamless between them so the continuity is good 
len ratingtwo One thing it s good but then I can t join as guest it will not let me join as guest 
len ratingtwo There is no place to join as guest 
len ratingfive Hooray for today
len ratingfive Teams is the present and future nerve for meetings and communications the software overcome the current situation of C and it facilities all staff members and many others to maintain a professional meetings 
len ratingfive It have many future that needs more levels to address 
len ratingone Does not work with car hands free Bluetooth audio devices 
len ratingone I had to get out my Bluetooth earbuds 
len ratingfive Does everything I need 
len ratingfive It s the best thing I seen in this app all me class mates have it and if your able to do it here I would be gladly happy
len ratingfive Very easy to use it lets you switch between the screen which is awesome 
len ratingfive  Excellent 
len ratingfive This is leaps above Skype for business 
len ratingfive Everything just works simple as that 
len ratingone  Too laggy and has too many bad features
len ratingthree Can t raise my hand
len ratingthree Teams is supposed to replace Skype business 
len ratingthree But Skype business was seamlessly integrated into Apple CarPlay 
len ratingthree Please integrate this feature 
len ratingthree It s a great platform to stay informed in real time 
len ratingthree My experience is not as favorable with video Conferencing 
len ratingthree Connectivity and resolution is poor 
len ratingthree My experience includes teams on multiple media vices phone or computer 
len ratingfive Excelente felicitaciones a los creadores de esta app 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Microsoft has done it again 
len ratingfive Very easy to use all in one package 
len ratingone Apps like planner doesn t work well cannot scroll or modify tasks
len ratingone  Difficult to use on iPhone with Teams 
len ratingone Not impressed 
len ratingtwo The meeting never connects unless you restart it which takes a long time 
len ratingfive Please make it easier for guest to sign in 
len ratingone I m unable to turn on notifications for teams app in settings on apple ipad Pro model This is a huge issue to me as I pretty much use ipad as my primary device for teams
len ratingfive Life made easy Life saver you name this app has done it 
len ratingthree I love it for the most part it s a good alternative for Google docs if you don t have it like me 
len ratingthree My only issue is that when going to files it will say a document has been moved or deleted A LOT 
len ratingthree Even when it s there 
len ratingthree You have to close out the application or wait about minutes for the documents to suddenly reappear again 
len ratingthree It s annoying when I have to get things done in real time
len ratingthree When joining a video via my work issued laptop I can NEVER get through a session without freezing or getting kicked off the call 
len ratingthree This forces me to join from my personal iPad 
len ratingthree That works well but the functionality is much lower 
len ratingthree For example I can only see four people at a time 
len ratingthree I m not sure if this is an issue with the configuration of my laptop or something else but it is a severe limitation 
len ratingfive Been using Teams heavily since the start of COVID 
len ratingfive It really keeps my ability to do my job remotely 
len ratingfive Easy and powerful 
len ratingone i dont like it 
len ratingone messy and in some of my classes when a call is started i dont get notified unless i go in the app to the teams section at the bottom 
len ratingone i miss calls and get bad grades 
len ratingone REMOVE THIS APP 
len ratingone its just bad
len ratingone Take this app off the store it s so confusing and not worth your time at all do not buy this a ever
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingthree Two days back i lost content of file edited online didnt auto save 
len ratingthree Cannot delete old chat in bulk no save of
len ratingone La verdad es que deber an de quitar esta aplicaci n porque deja muchos trabajos y los usuarios nos sentimos como esclavos mandando todos los d as trabajos que no nos van a servir para nada en el futuro y esto es sobre explotaci n hacia el alumno
len ratingfive Great experience 
len ratingfive Happy to use it
len ratingfive Since I started using Teams during Covid outbreak I found that it has provided many features that improve communication 
len ratingfive In particular it allows side communication voice calls chat and file sharing between small groups of people in a larger team activity 
len ratingfive It also allows people other then the leader to take and give back control from the leader 
len ratingfive I am sure that there are copious other features that I have yet to try 
len ratingfive Great product 
len ratingfour We need the ability to point at someone s shared screen 
len ratingfour Or draw on top of it 
len ratingfive teams is awesome totally get it 
len ratingfive it s worth your wild
len ratingthree This app is really amazing 
len ratingthree I m in love 
len ratingthree Of course it has little problems which you can fix 
len ratingfive Exceeded my expectations
len ratingone  Gave me STDs
len ratingone Chats are forever recorded by the app and your organization 
len ratingone Teams doesn t give you the ability to delete them if you make a mistake
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive I like teams but I can t get the virtual background in meetings this app is great and you get to schedule meetings chat with people call them and you can share your screen recomended for school
len ratingfour I love this app 
len ratingfour I just wish it would keep me logged in indefinitely 
len ratingone This app is not good because first of all when we used it at the beginning of the online stuff it would crash and it would not let me upload my work and my teachers had to use another platform to put in some work and for us to upload our work not only that but have tooo many notifications and this app allowed teachers to go crazy of the amount of work we got not only that but it opened on my computer even when I didn t need it 
len ratingone Super laggy 
len ratingone Doesn t work most times 
len ratingone Randomly kicks me off 
len ratingone Takes time away from work to try to fix the problem 
len ratingone It has to be reset frequently and is a pain in the but
len ratingfive Una herramienta muy til para nuestro trabajo en estos tiempos de covid sobre todo 
len ratingthree not the easiest meeting concept but it is probably fine after getting used to it 
len ratingone  I prefer Google Classroom or Edmodo for teaching my classes online 
len ratingone Teams is the worst because makes everything more complicated 
len ratingfour iOS Please troubleshoot the new mobile Raise Hand feature and please add more Virtual Background options 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfour Please troubleshoot the recently added Raise Hand mobile feature It continues to disappear even after install uninstall reinstall iOS 
len ratingfour Also in addition to Blur Background please add other Virtual Backgrounds with the option to select and set prior to meeting 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive It helps us get toghther in this COVID 
len ratingfive I think this is an awesome platform 
len ratingfive The ability to train while you are mobile or at home during times of crisis is extremely beneficial 
len ratingfive People are reluctant to change buy once I ve shown people some of its capability they are pretty surprised 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive One stop shop for communication messaging and collaboration
len ratingone  I can t stand apps that hound you to turn on notifications 
len ratingone If I have them off I want them off 
len ratingone Stop asking me and get rid of the alert icon 
len ratingfive  Teams owns your chili 
len ratingone Please for the love add a reject call button 
len ratingone A call will make my phone totally useless while a call is coming in 
len ratingone It s the worst 
len ratingone I know it s min but min is a lot when you are trying to use google maps in a car 
len ratingfive We just finished a meeting and it went very well
len ratingfour Needs dark mode
len ratingfour Why does it not have the full capability of Skype 
len ratingfour When attending meetings allow dialing from multiple device like laptop and phone 
len ratingfour That makes it easier to switch 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo Version or remembered my name when I joined subsequent meetings as a guest 
len ratingtwo I only had to enter my guest name once 
len ratingtwo Version makes me type my name in every time when I join a meetings as a guest 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo Update Uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingtwo It works now 
len ratingtwo I also wonder if it could have something to do with the fact that after the first update a join meeting from outlook ran the app the first time 
len ratingtwo After reinstall I manually launched the app and it worked 
len ratingtwo Previous I was using the app to join meetings just fine since March 
len ratingtwo Then I applied the latest version of the app and it just quits every time I try to launch it 
len ratingtwo I even tried restarting the phone and it made no difference 
len ratingtwo I will next try to uninstall it and reinstall it 
len ratingtwo But now I can t join any work meetings using my iPhone 
len ratingtwo Microsoft please address this 
len ratingtwo Connecting to Meetings via mobile is a requirement for my job 
len ratingone The iPad app crashes when logging in on a corporate account 
len ratingfive We started using this before COVID hit and we have been using it ever since 
len ratingfive We love it 
len ratingfive Very resourceful and user friendly at the beginning I was apprehensive but it really does facilitate my work and with Social Distancing I m able to feel relax knowing I don t have to be with my coworkers and exposing ourselves to COVID 
len ratingfive Highly recommend it
len ratingfive Much better connections and good features
len ratingone Does not notify me as soon as the message comes in despite have my notification settings turned on with background app refresh
len ratingthree When uploading photos from phone you cannot select multiple photos 
len ratingthree This becomes time consuming and tedious 
len ratingfive I find this app simple and easy to use 
len ratingone  Teams was making good improvements for iPadOS but took a major step backwards in the share screen options 
len ratingone I need to be able to share any screen app while in a meeting without having to use the screen recording option 
len ratingfive Really great program 
len ratingfive It s so intuitive 
len ratingfive Allows colleagues to work together easily make calls never have to look for a conference room book a meeting and there s a link to call that s automatically included no more having to send separate conference link synced with outlook can tag people seamless 
len ratingfive It s great 
len ratingfive Team is a great tool for project collaboration among teammates 
len ratingthree Please add the feature of taking screenshots from chat window 
len ratingone Not good at all would not recommend 
len ratingone But it s whatever I graduated from teams classof p
len ratingfour I ve enjoyed the app so far 
len ratingfour Great platform to keep updated with the team and share documents 
len ratingfour The call has very good quality too 
len ratingfour Only one thing is the status is not real time 
len ratingfour The status shows Away at first but once you click on the icon and go out it will show the real status which might be Available 
len ratingfour Good overall but there are annoying bugs 
len ratingfour In particular my app says I always have one unread message and I don t 
len ratingfour Deleting the app and reinstalling didn t help
len ratingthree Keep the in call controls visible or just give us the option to keep them always visible 
len ratingthree It s been years since this feature has been requested and still nothing from the Microsoft devs 
len ratingthree It takes way too long to mute and unmute yourself when the controls auto hide every few seconds 
len ratingthree Anyone who has used the app for any amount of time can see this 
len ratingthree Other than that the app otherwise works pretty well
len ratingone  Despite my efforts to try and use Teams on the iPhone the app tells me to allow access to my microphone in the Settings but there is no microphone to select and Teams does not show up under the microphone as asking for access permissions 
len ratingfive During COVID Teams has allowed me to have safe presentations to my customer and colleagues 
len ratingfive I do not know what I would have done without them 
len ratingone I have triple checked all of my notification settings and have consulted every relevant support article I can find 
len ratingone Unfortunately notifications stop working after a few weeks every time I delete and install the app 
len ratingone I have now deleted and reinstalled the app four times 
len ratingone Notifications are working again 
len ratingone Hopefully this time it will be fixed 
len ratingone It s so frustrating 
len ratingthree Works pretty reliably 
len ratingthree I dislike that it doesn t sync to desktop for calls and that calls don t get picked up by AirPods 
len ratingfive  I love it
len ratingfour My Company is on TEAMS 
len ratingfour It s a great tool for remote workers but I tend to use it mostly for Voice and Vedeo Calls 
len ratingfour I find it over redundant to use it as an email OUTLOOK replacement since everyone at work defaults tonOUTLOOK EMAILS for collaboration 
len ratingfive I m a middle schooler who never really was super fond of school 
len ratingfive This app just makes handing in assignments so much faster and is honestly the highlight of online school 
len ratingfive Awesome tool for inclusion amp sharing 
len ratingfive I am a big fan 
len ratingfive Thanks for your incredible innovative user friendly features 
len ratingfive Teams is a greatapp
len ratingfive I don t have words to explain my admiration for this App 
len ratingfive It is simply the best 
len ratingfive Thanks for providing us with this 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone  i hate it 
len ratingone It s so laggy like I cant even do my online never worth it so laggy
len ratingthree  Hello I appreciate the dark theme you implemented but the app s launch screen if not also the icon is still white and bright 
len ratingthree Can you please also give us the option to turn that dark 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingone  It s bad that all I have to say
len ratingfive There are some issues with audio when in a call and a sig alert or some Other interruption comes in when using headphone or airports 
len ratingfive Then the call s audio will be lost and I have to quit the App and reconnect to the call 
len ratingfive Happened on my wife s phone too 
len ratingthree Keep improving
len ratingfive Easy to use and allows everyone to stay on task 
len ratingthree  Update Uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingthree It works now 
len ratingthree I also wonder if it could have something to do with the fact that after the first update a join meeting from outlook ran the app the first time 
len ratingthree After reinstall I manually launched the app and it worked 
len ratingthree Previous I was using the app to join meetings just fine since March 
len ratingthree Then I applied the latest version of the app and it just quits every time I try to launch it 
len ratingthree I even tried restarting the phone and it made no difference 
len ratingthree I will next try to uninstall it and reinstall it 
len ratingthree But now I can t join any work meetings using my iPhone 
len ratingthree Microsoft please address this 
len ratingthree Connecting to Meetings via mobile is a requirement for my job 
len ratingthree Feature rich and easy to use 
len ratingthree Can t coauthor between tenants
len ratingone I can no longer share my screen due to new updates 
len ratingone The simple share my screen no longer works and the directions it provides require settings changes and they still don t work 
len ratingfive  This app eh
len ratingfive Even works in Linux 
len ratingfour Company switched over to this so I have to use it 
len ratingfour Works OK for the most part but could be a lot better and how some things are organized 
len ratingfour I did think it was a little dirty that it asks if you like the app and if you click yes Then you are redirected to the App Store to leave a review 
len ratingfour How much do you want to bet that if you click no then it does not 
len ratingfour Would have given stars if I could edit wiki on my phone 
len ratingfour I am a Project Manager and love the Wiki function but a travel for work and can t add notes to wiki without opening my laptop 
len ratingfour This would be great if I could add notes while on the move 
len ratingfour I do have the Wiki app but still can only view it can t edit 
len ratingone  I was using the app to join meetings just fine since March 
len ratingone Then I applied the latest version of the app and it just quits every time I try to launch it 
len ratingone I even tried restarting the phone and it made no difference 
len ratingone I will next try to uninstall it and reinstall it 
len ratingone But now I can t join any work meetings using my iPhone 
len ratingone Microsoft please address this 
len ratingone Connecting to Meetings via mobile is a requirement for my job 
len ratingone  I can t like open the app at all it just stuck in the same screen
len ratingone Teams is great but it s not mobile 
len ratingone It does not work on my iphone 
len ratingone Not good 
len ratingone My teams mobile never receives calls unless I have it open 
len ratingone I had the same issue with Skype for Business and really was hoping that Teams would resolve that issue but it seems to have followed Microsoft into their new app this is a real bummer because so am often away from my desk and miss a fairly large number of calls 
len ratingfour Great features but they take a little time to learn how to use 
len ratingfour Little things hidden here and there not easy to use 
len ratingfive Just what I ve needed to keep track
len ratingfour They have to increase the number of viewable participants in the meeting 
len ratingone After using it for a while my schedule wouldn t load 
len ratingone It has a lot of glitched and lags a lot 
len ratingthree Notifications don t really work for me Can t view everyone in a video meeting like a grid layout The app works for me but there are a few random glitches you ll see but are hard to describe
len ratingone I cant raise my hands in meeting because it doesn t appear to me in the app and i have the last update for Microsoft team please solve this problem as soon as possible MY PHONE IS PRO Max 
len ratingone  this app is less than divine 
len ratingone its trashier than bryce hall slower than the furries in my pe class more complicated than rocket science laggier than a samsung more confusing than politics and more stressful than being in the principles office as lizzo once said truth hurts so that why i m here 
len ratingone arianna grande told me to just keep breathing but this app makes me wanna suffocate 
len ratingone a boogie wit da hoodie said he was drowning and that s what teachers are doing to us with all this unecessary work 
len ratingone this app needs to end just like nick cannons rap career and it needs more help than minute crafts 
len ratingone teams makes me more depressed than the self diagnosed sixth graders 
len ratingone i wish this app would just pull a fetty wap nd just dip off the app store 
len ratingone this app is very much a waste of time just like karens and i would very much appreciate it if it went ghost just like adele 
len ratingone the app store need to break this app off just like one direction did 
len ratingone thank you for your time 
len ratingone It Dosent Work Correctly When U Press Assignments it Takes U Out Of The App
len ratingone  Yeet
len ratingone  Ya borren esto ya no queremos clases que se muera teams
len ratingone  Bye bye teams
len ratingfive Good interface amp sound quality is okay
len ratingfive Honestly this app is one of the greatest apps to work with 
len ratingfive It s efficient and effective from creating groups for specific projects to conducting meetings remotely and sharing files 
len ratingfour I m a student we do lives in this app it apperes to me that I m not in a team and I don t have a team I would want to rate it but star gone of trubele sining in 
len ratingthree The latest update states that we can get the raise hand feature however the raise has disappeared from both my iOS devices 
len ratingthree I saw it for a few minutes and it never came back 
len ratingthree It would also be nice to share videos YouTube and otherwise within the meeting session and have my students hear the audio on iPad and iPhone 
len ratingthree Even when I play directly the YouTube app or the website the audio doesn t work 
len ratingthree Even videos I have saved directly to my device can t be heard 
len ratingfour Im sure there are features i have not seen 
len ratingfour I do wish for certain features like push to talk
len ratingone So laggy
len ratingfive Trabajamos s per
len ratingone  Help
len ratingone This is terrible 
len ratingone I was able to get into one meeting out of four so far 
len ratingone The thing says it s updating the calendar and has been that way now for a week or better 
len ratingone We use to dial in for our meetings 
len ratingone Never had a problem with that 
len ratingone Yet just one more reason for me to believe that all this convenience software really isn t so convenient 
len ratingone Not every person plays with their phone for hours at a time 
len ratingone Some of us actually believe that simple is best 
len ratingone Most people don t share in your enthusiasm to have a bigger better mousetrap especially when the old one worked just fine 
len ratingone I speak for a lot of people when I say that having to learn your system in order to have the very same conversation we had over land lines is crazy 
len ratingone Congratulations on your victory of moving people to your format 
len ratingone I wish you all the same hassles that I go through every Monday when our Team meeting takes place and struggling to find a way to get in on it 
len ratingone Brilliant 
len ratingone If I could give this zero stars I would 
len ratingone Using an app on your phone for a work video meeting with screen sharing is terrible 
len ratingone Microsoft should have this app in the App Store for Mac OS so I can use this on my MacBook instead 
len ratingone Then this iPhone app could simply be a way to use my phone as a webcam 
len ratingone That would be awesome 
len ratingone Forcing us to download an unvetted program from the web is terrible 
len ratingone Especially when it is coming from a company like Microsoft that would sooner grab and sell every piece of data they can collect on you rather than protecting your security and privacy 
len ratingone For the love of God just put this app in the App Store for MacOS already 
len ratingone We don t trust you but we do trust Apple 
len ratingone  Just get rid of this app I H A T E school work 
len ratingone Thank you for your time 
len ratingone I would give zero stars but I can t but an over all good platform without the work 
len ratingfive During the COVID period MS Teams has been an invaluable communications tool for my project team to stay coordinated 
len ratingfive MS Teams was easily installed on both my Windows laptop computer and my iPhone 
len ratingfive It s seamless going back and forth between them 
len ratingfive It is really helpful to have calendar and chat connected 
len ratingfive I donot miss meetings
len ratingfive It s transforming the way we work and the whole team loves it 
len ratingfour More productivity due to ease of communicating to others immediately when needed 
len ratingfive Super helpful work tool
len ratingone  school
len ratingfive Meetings work well chat and calendar reminders 
len ratingtwo This app is unreliable and glitchy 
len ratingfour Overall Teams is an excellent product with great usability and collaboration features 
len ratingfour Just a small downside Whiteboard although is available in Desktop version is absent in iPad version where it would be best used 
len ratingthree If they get to viewers at a time I d give it stars 
len ratingone They should ve let us just put our password in it took minutes just to send a code and I resent the code times 
len ratingfive My only issue with it is that you can t clear the notifications but other than that it is mostly a good app and I love that
len ratingone  This is definitely not meant for school it s confusing and tricky to use
len ratingfour I like Teams but there are some additional features needed 
len ratingfour It would be good to be able to see multiple people in the video 
len ratingfour Basically see the people on video that aren t talking 
len ratingfour Also have a screen the switches to the person speaking 
len ratingone This app unreliable
len ratingfive  Wow 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingtwo Yes I have verified everything on the iOS side for notifications turn the phone off on updated the app turned off on the notification options within the app and yet unless the app is the one and screen I do not get notifications and even then there can be a delay of five plus minutes or not at all 
len ratingtwo When we first started using it there was no issue 
len ratingtwo In the last few weeks I have stopped receiving notifications which is can signal to my supervisor I m not actually working I have to continually open my app and check and see if I have a message which I forget to do when I m wrapped in researching a problem 
len ratingfour Great potential for full collaboration with a diverse and disparate located workforce 
len ratingfour We are only scratching the surface of its functionality but there are needed upgrades to improve ease of use and integration 
len ratingfour This was a much needed application for the new COVID work environment 
len ratingfour It s great tool 
len ratingfour Teams meeting starting a meeting there are too many questions pop up and takes couple of minutes to join a meeting 
len ratingfour Also while sharing screen on teams while meeting 
len ratingfour Computer slows down 
len ratingfour Thank you
len ratingfive  Awesome
len ratingone  I hate this app
len ratingfive This app makes it easy to connect with coworkers boo on a quick call and solve a problem across the continent
len ratingfive Collaboration is all about teams can t wait to see and experience upcoming roadmaps 
len ratingtwo Like Zuckerberg s apps Teams also demands access to my contacts address book 
len ratingtwo Developer I don t want to add every person I interview to my address book 
len ratingfour I don t write a lot of reviews but have to say this app service is slick 
len ratingfour Our office uses MS and generally detest MS software but figured I d try this out to see if it was worth while for the team to use 
len ratingfour I am actually surprised with how easy it is to use for chat and really surprised at the video quality 
len ratingfour You can make voice calls and leave voicemails too 
len ratingfour Sharing files and having team discussions in separate channels has been a blessing to my email inbox 
len ratingfour The only challenges experienced have been memory usage and battery drain 
len ratingfour This app will gobble up every bit of free memory and battery power it can get its hands on 
len ratingfour Since I m on a laptop that s no bueno Overall the service is stable feature rich and has great iOS apps 
len ratingfour Again really surprised me 
len ratingfour See more people like you can on Zoom
len ratingone  bro idk man this app kept sending nonfications from some random people with the words to do on it idk
len ratingtwo We re unable to edit office files on app 
len ratingtwo Guest users who are redirected to their installed office apps cannot edit the files that they have access to using their guest accounts on those apps but they can edit those files using Desktop Teams 
len ratingfour I like all the features on the app version of Teams 
len ratingfour The reason I m not giving five stars is that the Planner Kanban view needs usability improvements 
len ratingfour The task cards are too sensitive it needs to improve distinguishing between scroll gesture and moving task gesture 
len ratingfour More than once I ended up moving tasks around when I wanted to simply scroll the screen 
len ratingfour Hopefully this will be improved in a future release 
len ratingthree Tom much feedback
len ratingfour teams conversation and reply placement is confusing apart from that everything is great 
len ratingone  Who s the genius that thought yeah let s only show four users in a meeting 
len ratingfour I would like to get alerts for chats posted in team groups just like I do in the chat section 
len ratingfour I don t understand why it isn t the same 
len ratingone I went through the mind numbing process to create this account only to be told that I do not have teams because I wasn t invited 
len ratingone My dr s office uses this platform it s bad 
len ratingone I tried signing up for the teams again it forces you to sign up for Skype which I already have 
len ratingone Hard pass on this one 
len ratingone Stick with Webex teams FaceTime or even just Skype 
len ratingone Big thumbs down 
len ratingone  This application stopped working on my iPhone max with the last update 
len ratingone The program runs in the background but the GUI displays for a second then disappears 
len ratingone I still get notifications but can not see them in the app 
len ratingfive Teams is great 
len ratingfive I love the fact you can do a video conferencing call text and it keeps track of your conversation 
len ratingfive I was able to take classes and stay connected even on my lunch break 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfour Having Sm
len ratingone  It s horrible that s all I have to say and plus it s causes me to want to kill myself
len ratingfive Now using this app on both my iPhone and work computer and it is much better than Skype 
len ratingfive I can start a meeting on my phone and finish it on my computer without missing anything 
len ratingfive Really liking this app 
len ratingfour Video can be choppy but overall a great program for communication for many people at once and we have fun with the virtual backgrounds
len ratingfive Seamless integration 
len ratingfive Great on line team meeting as well 
len ratingfive In this day of remote work this is a life saver 
len ratingone  It s creepy stop
len ratingfive There are so many things you can do with Teams and it becomes even more powerful and collaborative when you include the bolt on apps 
len ratingfive This has changed the way I manage project communications and reporting 
len ratingone This app is always glitching and it s a waste of time 
len ratingone My point has been made take this off the app store please 
len ratingfive Great experience 
len ratingthree First off i use teams on an iPad 
len ratingthree I do not have the same hand raise and sharing screen on the iPad 
len ratingthree It is so unfair and also a big disadvantage 
len ratingthree When I need to show my teacher a certain problem with a website for example I cannot do that 
len ratingthree Please read this note and try to upgrade it 
len ratingone  How long does it take a Microsoft team engineers to add a simple background blur AND backdrop change to the phone app 
len ratingone Never 
len ratingone Come on guys it s not that hard to code and it s an important feature to have 
len ratingone Any other group video chat apps out there can do that already 
len ratingone Do you guys really want to wait till the Pandemic is over and then add this feature when no one uses Team anymore 
len ratingone How about the limitation to see only faces come on
len ratingone  Le doy esta puntuaci n porque no sirven en el iPad se traba todo el tiempo la app aveces no me deja ingresar a clase se traba el micr fono y la c mara
len ratingthree No delete buttons for chats calls and other activities 
len ratingthree Delete button is a must
len ratingone Horrible service
len ratingthree Need to see everyone instead of just people
len ratingfour Great platform 
len ratingfour Drawback is clunky document management 
len ratingone  The look of it is not clean at all 
len ratingone Wish it would be more organized and aesthetically pleasing to actually work on 
len ratingone Some buttons don t work 
len ratingone Others are just plane out CONFUSING 
len ratingone Would not recommend to anyone 
len ratingone Once you login on Gates computer it freeze other apps like quik and gate reader
len ratingone The app use to work and now doesn t go past the loading screen internet works fine and I ve tried reinstalling 
len ratingone On the iPad Pro 
len ratingfive I have been using Microsoft Teams on my PC and my phone and it is a great experience so far highly recommend this software app 
len ratingfive Teams has been an excellent communication tool as all coworkers are working remote now 
len ratingfive Very easy to collaborate create team calls screen shares etc 
len ratingfive A few updates would be the cherry on top 
len ratingfive As a creative team we are always dropping files into the chat function to share progress shots inspiration images and comps 
len ratingfive I and a lot of my team uses the same file naming structure for these images so there are multiple files with the same name 
len ratingfive Teams will not let you upload files with the same name without a pop up window asking if you want to keep both files and if I click yes it renames them xxxxxx xxxxxx and so on 
len ratingfive When an audio call comes in via Teams it only shows the person initiating the call 
len ratingfive A John Doe via Project xxxxxx Group would be all it needs 
len ratingfive More customizability within chat groups 
len ratingfive We use chat groups of the time vs broader team group windows 
len ratingfive Would be nice to be able to change sounds chat group avatar background image etc 
len ratingfive Other than that love the app and it s integration into Outlook calendar and contacts 
len ratingtwo I have extensively tried to troubleshoot the fact the notifications do not appear on my phone anymore but I cannot get them to work which seriously disrupts my workflow 
len ratingtwo Other than that one glaring issue the app works well 
len ratingfive This is a great tool for team collaboration and persis Lots of great features included depending on your agreement E or E etc you may have more or less 
len ratingfive Good stuff 
len ratingfive Wouldn t use Zoom after this unless I had to 
len ratingfive Muy f scil de usar 
len ratingfive Everyone in my company uses it and we all love it 
len ratingfive Has many integrations and already built in task and file management features 
len ratingfive  When trying to connect sales team members engineers project managers and the production team Microsoft teams makes it quick and easy 
len ratingfive With the app you don t always need to be at the office or at your computer to stay update 
len ratingthree I think this a good app I just wanted them to add all the cool features to a iPad also Like virtual background sometimes the notifications don t come You Cant share ur screen and share ur sound at the same time using an iPad If all of these features come Then this a star app 
len ratingfour An improvement would be to allow for more face frames on team meetings or if this is not possible at least allowing meeting attendees to choose the frames persons they see rather than whoever is speaking for randomly chosen 
len ratingfour Allowing for frames up to would be a nice improvement
len ratingtwo Hdhhdjdj
len ratingfive Fantastic app 
len ratingfive Really well rounded 
len ratingfive Wish I could invite clients to use the chat
len ratingfive It basically works the same way as the desktop app and you can easily join meetings make calls set up new meetings 
len ratingfive No restrictions whatsoever SKYPE WHO 
len ratingfive Great app to use for work 
len ratingthree Sound Volume too Low When in a Meeting even volume to the max 
len ratingone Add the app using a work account 
len ratingone No longer needed it and deleted it from my phone 
len ratingone Just installed the Microsoft Office app and it is trying to use the Teams account 
len ratingone Reinstalled teams and sure enough it remembered my phone and associated it with the work account 
len ratingone How do you make Teams completely forget my phone 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It s more focused than a simple messaging app 
len ratingfive The video calls are great
len ratingthree Too many features not compatible in IOS 
len ratingone  I hate school so every body seeing this rate it a star
len ratingtwo  Calendar is out of sync with the server 
len ratingtwo Does not notify all the time abt upcoming meetings 
len ratingfive Love
len ratingone ive been trying to change my pfp forever and it keeps on saying we were unable to upload ur image if i could rate it one star i would horrible app needs improvement 
len ratingone Literally the worst video conference I ve ever had 
len ratingone Took me hours to figure out even basic features of the program and then turns out you have to pay to even call people 
len ratingone Absolutely useless 
len ratingone Use zoom it s easier to use free and works well 
len ratingone This is absolute garbo
len ratingone  I got viruses and emails with James Charles
len ratingfive Teams makes it easy to have quick syncs and collaborations with team members 
len ratingfive I love the chat screen share and vid chat options 
len ratingfour  The app is used but somehow stopped sending me push notifications all of a sudden 
len ratingfour I ve been missing messages because I don t get any notifications until I open the app 
len ratingfour Not sure why this s happening as it was working just fine weeks ago 
len ratingfive There are so many advantages with this change we have had by using Teams 
len ratingfive I love how user friendly it is 
len ratingfive I love that one can download it to your phone and never miss a beat 
len ratingfive Too bad we didn t have this before what an excellent organizational tool 
len ratingfive I can t say enough Maria Gomez Volume Recruiter
len ratingone  Its bad
len ratingone I do not like this app always giving notifications about work that I don t have to do so I have to say to my teacher yea I didn t get the notification my teacher I know you got it where s your work THIS APP NEEDS TO BE EXTINCT THE WORLD IS ENDING amp THEYRE ASKING FOR WORK This rests my case so I don t have to do work this app is dead 
len ratingone  and that s on period 
len ratingfive MS Teams was the best thing that my organization could have provided us with during the pandemic It has allowed us to facilitate communications between remote teams and we have done all this while avoiding emails 
len ratingfour Need to be able to use MTGroups groups set up internally NOT a Teams group
len ratingthree This app is great 
len ratingthree The ONE FLAW is the fact that you can t delete a conversation that should be fixed IMMEDIATELY 
len ratingthree Please and thanks
len ratingthree So ita very different in ipad I personally can t understand it and i need it for school but other than that its a great app
len ratingthree Everything works fine on my laptop but when I switched using my iPad I couldn t use most of the features available on my laptop and the worst problem was that I couldn t see raise hand button at all 
len ratingthree But still a very good app for work and school 
len ratingone Please trim down the size of app 
len ratingone Thanks
len ratingone Could sign in after password update 
len ratingone Infinite loop of asking for credential input 
len ratingfive I like it but I can t even see the words I m typing lol 
len ratingfive words I m
len ratingtwo The app is awesome but it would be amazing if it had phone calls chats with the students and most of all easier to use 
len ratingtwo I always get complaints of my students telling me how to work the app but I barley even know myself 
len ratingfive I don t know how they did it but Teams is just extremely responsive and quick on m u iPad Pro 
len ratingfive We ll done Microsoft 
len ratingone  Tuti
len ratingone I have tried to talk to my teachers on FaceTime on here and it won t let me I tried multiple times to do so
len ratingone i hate this it really glitching like dis and yea k bye
len ratingone  I m only doing this to get it taken off the app store
len ratingfive One destination for chat video calls scheduling meetings 
len ratingfive I have used both Slack and Teams and Teams beats slack hands down 
len ratingone  Why just why would you make an app that barely works
len ratingone The app missed the option To schedule a meeting through the app meet now button in the teams section
len ratingfour Please allow to users post replies on desktop version as allowed on mobile version
len ratingtwo can t see full list of people in group conversations just the numbers of people but no name also switching between people is not possible like desktop version which actually limits the usability in ios experience 
len ratingtwo please update these issues
len ratingone I m unable to sign in with my account email address which is a mil account 
len ratingone The same account works fine on my Macbook 
len ratingone When I try to log in with my address changed to com which isn t correct it asks me for my verification code 
len ratingone But when I enter my actual mil address I just get an error message and am unable to proceed in the sign in process 
len ratingone  ii dont like the app its pretty crappy
len ratingfour Would like to be able to see the schedule even on days not scheduled to work
len ratingfive It is business and play 
len ratingfive It has everything 
len ratingfive I loved on email until Teams came along 
len ratingfive It keeps things short sweet fun and organized 
len ratingthree I am currently using Zoom for virtual gatherings that are more than people 
len ratingthree It would be great to see my entire team of people on a screen 
len ratingfive I loved it 
len ratingthree I ve been using Teams on the desktop and do admire it 
len ratingthree And it is very comparable on the iPad 
len ratingthree Recently when I authenticate with another device using MFA Teams immediately crashes 
len ratingthree Grrrr 
len ratingthree Using current version as of May 
len ratingone  please delete it from apple store not the app for me
len ratingfive I definitely love Teams 
len ratingfive Just I recently encountered an issue no notification can be turned on from settings after upgrading to the latest iOS 
len ratingfive I dunno where to report this hence writing a review 
len ratingone  This app is horrible
len ratingthree Need to add Apple Watch function for messaging team members from the watch 
len ratingone  Google Classroom is almost out of the App Store 
len ratingone And people are starting to do the low rate for no school challenge on tiktok 
len ratingone What is the point of it 
len ratingone There is a lot more apps 
len ratingfive Works well with interactive conferences
len ratingone I HATE IT
len ratingone I don t know if it is a new update but now I can not call people through Microsoft teams 
len ratingone I do not like this app
len ratingfive I ve been using Teams for about a month now 
len ratingfive Easy to learn but like anything new takes time to adopt 
len ratingfive What I love are all of the seamless integrations with MS Office as well as the huge library of available apps 
len ratingfive Loving this tool more every day 
len ratingfive I can talk to my friends to my techter so work that is fan for me I know it sounds stoped but I love it
len ratingfive Almost makes it too easy to stay connected with work on my personal devices 
len ratingthree  Notifications have been delayed or not arriving at all lately
len ratingone Notifications haven t worked for about months 
len ratingone Cannot send feedback because that uses email 
len ratingone Support the MICROSOFT Outlook Email app then 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble caused 
len ratingone Can you please take the latest update and let us know if you still see this issue 
len ratingone It will help if you can share debug logs from App when you see this issue using Hamburger Menu gt Setti
len ratingfour Can t figure out how to call newly created Team
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingone  Turn in my assignments and my teachers don t get the work
len ratingfive Extremely easy and has a lot of tools that will make your life easier 
len ratingone  I don t like doing work
len ratingfive  It s full of surprises and new dimensions as you continue to interface with it 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone  I have to do school on it 
len ratingfive Teams is great 
len ratingfive No ways around that
len ratingone Not very functional
len ratingfour I really am excited because I have a diverse team but we have in common a phone or computer and Microsoft inclusive teams
len ratingfour This app is really good especially in this time 
len ratingfour The quality is pretty good 
len ratingfour It could improve though 
len ratingfour Because of he recent global crisis the company I work for upgraded to teams 
len ratingfour So far it is working pretty well 
len ratingfour I wish the app had the same background options as the desktop but overall it only has minor hiccups 
len ratingone WhatsApp works and it s not Apple 
len ratingone Why can t this work 
len ratingone The settings are different on android 
len ratingone This is just another corporate politics issue harming the end user 
len ratingfive Consultant here who switches back and forth on different Teams for different clients 
len ratingfive The app handles it really smoothly much more so than the desktop or browser version actually 
len ratingfive Also integrates really well with iPhones native phone audio and calendar stuff 
len ratingfive Really strong app 
len ratingfive It s a ok app
len ratingfour My phone does not send me a tone notification for when I receive a new message 
len ratingfour I have looked at my settings and everything is adjusted 
len ratingfour I get notifications for everything else 
len ratingfour Wonder if it is a bug 
len ratingone not helpful and confusing
len ratingtwo This has been going on for about a week now and whenever I turn my camera on it stays black and says that i can t turn it on 
len ratingtwo Then i have to leave my meeting and shut down my computer 
len ratingtwo It s really inconvenient and would appreciate if you would fix this 
len ratingfive Very user s friendly 
len ratingfive App works very reliable 
len ratingfive The app works better than the desktop version
len ratingfive Customized backgrounds for our companies product information would be awesome
len ratingfive Really enjoy app 
len ratingone Very bad app 
len ratingone Calls are laggy and very poor quality and the unsee function doesn t work also submitting assignments take way too long to load 
len ratingone I don t recommend getting this app at all 
len ratingone  Ruined my quarantine 
len ratingfive This is a great app for employees work from home making team collaborations greater than any other tool in the industry 
len ratingfive I can do chat calls share documents customize my teams with different channels to organize my work 
len ratingfive Microsoft team is doing a great job helping employees work from home easy during the COVID lockdown 
len ratingfive Mobile app is one of my best and don t have to sit in front of my laptop to read messages or take calls 
len ratingfive This is a best app comes with less cost or no cost compared to other providers 
len ratingfive Thanks Microsoft Team for making employees work from home easy amp still more productive 
len ratingthree I ve noticed when messages come through on the mobile app they don t always appear on the desktop app 
len ratingthree This is a concern if you are not glued to your phone 
len ratingfive I can switch between my teams accounts on the iPhone app makes it really efficient
len ratingfive Quite good 
len ratingfive Optimized your corporate work 
len ratingone  oof
len ratingone Another typical Microsoft app on apple plat form 
len ratingone Don t waste your time it doesn t work 
len ratingone You and your team should use Zoom 
len ratingfour Needs Touch ID integration like the Outlook app
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive Stay ahead of the curve when it comes to this platform 
len ratingone  Uhh Everthing Wrong This Should Definitely Be Under So If You Don t Want School Just Write A Bad Review I Guess 
len ratingone  HORRIBLE I HATE IT 
len ratingone  i hate this app with a burning passion it needs to get taken down because it s too glitchy and never works for me
len ratingone  It s extremely glitchy and it s extremely difficult to upload stuff
len ratingone  The app glitches every time
len ratingfive Beautiful
len ratingone  No just not it
len ratingone Really glitchy
len ratingthree I don t like see all activities chats and no way to delete or archive after being read
len ratingone  I cant type or send things or access my grades
len ratingone  It never works and is so stressful with all the school work 
len ratingone I have good WiFi new computer and new phone obviously that s not the problem the problem is the app itself
len ratingone I believe that this app is in room for improvement 
len ratingone I ve seen kids getting pressured with constant and constant assignments 
len ratingone Even one teacher spammed their student with daily positive messages I find it very annoying 
len ratingone  no
len ratingone  This app is bad it really kills me inside to say this but people on this app have been very mean
len ratingone It is glitching
len ratingone  this app is the reason i am depressed
len ratingfive Much better than the Skype for business app calls are dependable now 
len ratingone  it is a waste of my time and does let me do my assignments it should be taken down
len ratingone having problems once in a while with not being able to join in meetings and not receiving group chats when notifications are turned on 
len ratingone will right a better review when it improves 
len ratingone  i dont like school
len ratingfive This is a very great too
len ratingone Now I have school work and the notifications could be better 
len ratingone The application crashes on log in on my iphone 
len ratingone Teams app runs on phones web browser but thats clunky and not phone friendly 
len ratingone This seems like a years long issue that needs to get fixed fast for MS to remain useful in my business and personal life 
len ratingfive Actually really find the app a great compliment to the desktop version 
len ratingfive I like how it integrates the calling functions 
len ratingfive Helps me get my work done 
len ratingfive The main benefit of teams is desktop use but having the app to carry on conversations on the go is really useful 
len ratingone this app is too stressful for kids too much assignments contacts parents about all missing work 
len ratingone HORRIBLE APP 
len ratingfive Excellent and reliable
len ratingfour Sometimes I use my phone and you can t switch between platforms Also conference calling is not an option
len ratingone Crashes during log in every time 
len ratingone Company uses OKTA two factor authentication and each time it gets to the step where I click approve in OKTA Teams crashes 
len ratingone Doesn t help if I am on VPN or not 
len ratingone Just instant crash 
len ratingone No error message 
len ratingone Frustrating 
len ratingfive The phone application works well though I m not testing it in any complex fashion I only use the phone app 
len ratingfive for messaging and sending pictures 
len ratingfive Occasionally I use video conferencing which functions well also 
len ratingfive I use the computer application regularly and am content with this as well 
len ratingone This app is to glitchy and it dose not work very well
len ratingone  it s so bad
len ratingone  Too glitchy
len ratingone teams is where all my hw is due please have mercy on me take it easy on my heart even though you don t mean to hurt me u keep tearing me apart
len ratingone It s so boring app i ever seen huh 
len ratingthree Other users are complaining too 
len ratingthree I no longer get notifications to alert me of new chat messages 
len ratingthree My settings are still ok and have been changed 
len ratingthree Will change rating once it s fixed but notifications are very important for work 
len ratingfive  Great 
len ratingone  Not able to save when doing homework 
len ratingone Which made me fail you pricks 
len ratingone Screw this app 
len ratingone Screw who ever made this too
len ratingone  Every time my I finish my work they send new ones like WHAT can I have a break 
len ratingone  Hate it shouldn t be an app
len ratingone  here i stand i have been getting a lot of class work from this app and it has been stressing me as a teen age girl my hormones are raging and i haven t had physical content with anyone in the last and a half months and it s truly driving me insane i don t know what to do at this point i try and try to do my best but they call my mom for missing one of assignments and it s making me lose my mind completely it s not the apps fault but i must do what is best for me and my fellow growing and devolving teens
len ratingone It s not a better place for kids to work
len ratingone They make us woke up and see everyone every week it s not funny I won t recommend this app they also have this thing called i don t remember what s it s called ohh yeah waking up times earlier than u usually wake up to do homework horrible horrible app
len ratingfour  There are a few improvements needed but the most important is the function to delete a whole chat 
len ratingfour It s such an easy feature for your developers to add to the app and it also clears the chats people have texted you as the wrong person or with those you just asked something and you never talked again 
len ratingfour A chat list full of unwanted chats looks very messy 
len ratingone Hack after downloading kicks out when I enter horrible app in general
len ratingone  idk
len ratingone Hated it I don t want it anymore
len ratingone  everyone put The ratings really low so that this app can get deleted
len ratingfive Quite useful and easy to use 
len ratingfive More and more public employees and Cobtractors are using 
len ratingfive Makes the working life in the COVID era a breeze 
len ratingfive Much appreciated 
len ratingfive Zack Azzari
len ratingone  Eww
len ratingthree  i like this app because it s easy to use but i don t like it because it is used to give me school 
len ratingthree i give it a hmm 
len ratingone The first time I tried to sign in Microsoft demanded tons of info the right to email me promotions without an option to opt out and then froze trying to sign in after informing me that my active subscription didn t work Stick with Zoom or even FaceTime 
len ratingone Microsoft is the laughing stock of the tech industry because they are what business solutions look like when built by inefficient unimaginative engineers who s ideas all look good on paper alone 
len ratingone Deleting now 
len ratingthree We migrated from RingCentral which couldn t maintain a call without launching the application 
len ratingthree We find Teams to be more consistent and reliable but missing many of the features RingCentral offered 
len ratingthree For example all of our contacts were able to be viewed in the RingCentral application and teams pulls limited data 
len ratingthree Additionally the only way to customize a voicemail is in the app and not on the server 
len ratingthree We hope Teams becomes more full featured with voice in the future 
len ratingone Tried Microsoft Teams tonight w office staff 
len ratingone Complete disaster 
len ratingone Couldn t start meeting and everyone frustrated 
len ratingone No help available 
len ratingone Went back to Zoom 
len ratingfive Its better than ok Good 
len ratingone It s is very confusing and doesn t have enough talk time ok now that the App Store is gone y all rate this a one star for we can t have it no more let s go 
len ratingfive Love the included storage space 
len ratingfive Excellent call quality with multiple participants and the ability to screen share individual windows programs or screens across multiple devices 
len ratingfive Haven t figured out to create custom groups or district lists yet but I hope the ability exists
len ratingone  this app gives me the chills
len ratingone This app keeps crashing and now it just gets stuck on the loading screen 
len ratingone I ve tried everything from unplugging and plugging the WiFi to just deleting and re downloading the app 
len ratingone Please fix this
len ratingone Every time I use this app for my online schooling because of the pandemic I can never get it to work because it keeps bugging and closes me out the app and I can never do any of my school work terrible app for school
len ratingtwo It is a great app for large meetings but I have some small steaiks that the tean missed out on 
len ratingtwo One you are only able to see for people at once on mobile 
len ratingtwo This isnt a great deal noting you can yhose who are speaking 
len ratingtwo But the biggest thing for me was the camera cover problem 
len ratingtwo On IOS when you are on a call if your ear touches the camera the phone will momentarily turn off 
len ratingtwo But this is applied when using this app and it is quite irritating 
len ratingtwo If part of anything breifly skims the camera my iPhone turns off for a second which gets annoying if I am trying to read screen shares 
len ratingfour With this app there isn t a need anymore to physically meet up 
len ratingfour I am definitely a big fan of teams 
len ratingfour I use it at least times a week 
len ratingfour I find it easier to use than Zoom 
len ratingfive Cooooooool
len ratingone Teams have been an awful choice when I submit my assignments my teachers never get them 
len ratingone On top of that it keeps crashing my device even though it is brand new 
len ratingone Teams have failed me and many more when there is a new assignment I don t get notified and I can never see my assignments 
len ratingone  Students rise up one star it
len ratingone  Too much work
len ratingfive This app has brought a ton of utility to my business and has been extremely helpful especially during this whole Covid non sense 
len ratingfive It allows me to communicate effectively with my team as if we were in person we haven t missed a beat 
len ratingfive Well worth it 
len ratingfive  I like it so I don t have to go on the computer all the time and I can get notifications win a new thing is posted
len ratingfour Of all the instant message apps I ve used Teams is one of them
len ratingone  Not useful at all very messy and unorganized 
len ratingfour This a great tool but there are some bugs that prevent accessing meetings at times 
len ratingfour System locks up 
len ratingfour Currently works best on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo Like most interfaces MS comes up with it isn t intuitive 
len ratingtwo One of the reasons I switched to Apple years ago 
len ratingtwo I m an IT manager and we are meetings in with my company s Executive Staff and I still have folks who can t manage to enter a video chat on their own 
len ratingtwo Once they get in though is works well 
len ratingfour Many in our organization struggled with the migration from Skype to TEAMS 
len ratingfour Many were resistant to the change 
len ratingfour I think these unprecedented circumstances have made believers out of even the most skeptical 
len ratingfour Productivity has been up and so has morale 
len ratingfour The only downside is the limitation on participant visibility during video calls 
len ratingfour Zoom is still leaps and bounds ahead in that aspect 
len ratingfour Time to up the ante Microsoft 
len ratingone This app is very confusing and very hard to figure it out I don t like the ways it is to get the work you need to do and how you need another whole app to edit
len ratingone i would give it starts if i could and that was an option but this app is terrible because they are giving teachers a way to give us work and only giving us a week or sometimes less and this app is so stressful and annoying as if depression wasn t enough 
len ratingone Not sure where all these star reviews are coming from but this app is horrible as is the entire Teams ecosystem 
len ratingone People may want to try other collaboration tools to really compare and see how low the bar is set for MS Teams 
len ratingone  Wiki is worthless without search 
len ratingone Notifications don t always work 
len ratingtwo The app worked once when I logged in weeks ago since then after inputting my credentials the app just closes out and brings me back to the login screen 
len ratingone I m Failing and it s your fault
len ratingone tbh not that bad 
len ratingone just doing this for a friend bc i don t even do my online hw
len ratingfive  This app is pretty good because it dose not lag for me and a lot of people can come on idk I just rlly like this app
len ratingone GAVE MY TEACHERS A WAY TO GIVE US WORK FOR ONLINE SCHOOLING AND POTENTIALLY RUIN MY FUTURE FIR NOT FINISHING IT ALL IN TIME
len ratingone What happen when talk kids don t have fun so this app is trash
len ratingone  This app is not organized in a way that it is efficient and easy to use 
len ratingone From a student s perspective it is hard to use and very annoying for for a number of reasons including assignments cannot be looked at in an orderly fashion that shows all class work and when it is due 
len ratingone There is also no calendar and since we are learning in a global pandemic teachers are assigning more work and expect us to check all of the classes even the ones that are seldom used and are using this app as a replacement for a classroom 
len ratingone I would not suggest downloading this app 
len ratingone It is just a waste of space 
len ratingfive Post the latest update of teams in mobile for iOS version I am unable to click on on any buttons in teams chat bot 
len ratingfive Even after clicking the button it just appears as I selected button name for copy and paste 
len ratingone It doesn t work well
len ratingfour I wish it has option to search content within the chat
len ratingone I get lost in the app a lot and sometimes I don t see any of my assignments
len ratingone Can still only see on ipad unacceptable compared to alternatives 
len ratingfour I wanted the Teams App to get messages from my work team and it works great 
len ratingfour Teams is great but there are a few features I d like to see the ability to have more than one thing open at a time 
len ratingfour For example you can t have more than one file open and during a Teams meeting opening a file means you can only see whoever is speaking in the meeting not everyone else 
len ratingfour Being able to split into multiple windows would be great 
len ratingfour  the ability to adjust your own image while in a meeting such as brightness and contrast 
len ratingfour  the ability to adjust the sound of individuals in a meeting 
len ratingfour In many meetings I ve noticed the sound for most people is fine but one or two sound muffled 
len ratingfour It would be great to click on them and adjust clarify their sound 
len ratingfour  lt end gt 
len ratingone It s annoying that when I upload work it disappears its ANNOYING and it makes me very very mad
len ratingfive Clean interface 
len ratingfive Combines the best of Slack good chats with the best of Zoom good video 
len ratingtwo I have had many experiences where I ll be in a remote learning lecture with my family nearby and microsoft teams will randomly un mute my microphone so the whole class can hear my family 
len ratingtwo I end up getting in trouble with my teachers 
len ratingtwo There should be a setting where the teacher can mute all the students and only the teacher can unmute so this does not happen and lectures do not get interrupted 
len ratingfive please
len ratingtwo  Why can t I call in teams 
len ratingtwo I can t group call 
len ratingtwo I can t call on chat why can t I 
len ratingtwo Not being able to call literally makes this app not very good 
len ratingtwo If there s chat why isn t there calls too 
len ratingfive Exceptional quality from Microsoft meets all my needs 
len ratingfive We use this as a main communication platform 
len ratingfive Just enough tools good user design and just works and does what it needs to do
len ratingtwo  When I go on the Video chats all I hear is echo and it s always frozen 
len ratingtwo Another reason why it s horrible is because you can only see or people at a time 
len ratingtwo I don t like it 
len ratingone This app barely works 
len ratingone I always try to leave good reviews in fact I have never left a bad review which shows but I really can t with this app it Tried to use this with my students and nothing worked the app keeps crashing and the coding is very inaccurate they app keeps deleting all there work taking them out of the assignments taking them to sketchy websites and one of my students was able to post his own assignment by pushing post 
len ratingone hopefully they can fix it but for now I do NOT recommend this app for teachers especially since it can take your students to very dangerous sites 
len ratingone If I could give this stars I would 
len ratingone absolutely unacceptable
len ratingone Why can u only look a the person speaking instead of everyone
len ratingfour I have two things to bring to attention 
len ratingfour After exiting from group chat if someone within that group starts a conversation it brings back the previous discussion holders can this be avoided 
len ratingfour Status of outlook does not change as per team s status unlike Skype 
len ratingone Utter rubbish 
len ratingone Slow 
len ratingone Buggy 
len ratingone Ugly 
len ratingone This is the worst app ever my kids and I are mad you wasted time downloading this why tho do you keep it here no work shown can t have my kids work on there hw and we are supposed to be joke no school should use this app this is not a good one and I hope it gets removed so not far to all parents and I feel like I had to step up so delete it for your own good 
len ratingone  Do star and let s take this down together NO MORE HOMEWORK
len ratingtwo It wont work im just tryna pass and yall over here updating the app 
len ratingone  This app STILL does not respect the quiet hours you set in the app 
len ratingone I still get phone calls and messages during quiet time 
len ratingone It has even bypasses my phone wide settings for Do Not Disturb 
len ratingone EXTREMELY annoying 
len ratingone Fix it now 
len ratingone It has also interfered with other apps that send notifications at specific times including an alarm clock app 
len ratingthree This app has a lot of potential but can be very frustrating 
len ratingthree My main issue by far is the lack of notifications on my phone 
len ratingthree I have both the desktop and mobile apps but can t get a single notification on my phone 
len ratingthree I ve turned all notifications off and back on both in the app and in my phone settings 
len ratingthree I made sure there are no quiet hours turned on notifications even when I m active on desktop turned on all notification styles in my phone settings went through each team and chat to turn notifications on and nothing 
len ratingthree I get nothing 
len ratingthree If I want to step away from my desk for a few minutes I have to bring my phone with me and constantly check it 
len ratingthree I ve done every troubleshooting tip even though it s all the things I already tried 
len ratingthree Please fix this it s a big problem to not get notifications 
len ratingthree Other than that there s sometimes a noticeable lag in getting messages or statuses updating 
len ratingthree I for some reason don t get calls on my phone but I used to so I think that may be connected to the lack of notifications 
len ratingthree No ability to put that your out of office as a status without putting an event in the calendar 
len ratingthree How is there not an off status 
len ratingthree The closest you can put is away which is frustrating when you need to chat w someone and don t know if they re away for a few minutes or the rest of the day 
len ratingthree Overall it s a decent app but several improvements are desperately needed 
len ratingfour I downloaded this on my computer and some days it decides to work some days it doesn t but it still is a good app stars
len ratingfour Teams seems pretty good 
len ratingfour I just wish it had the option that this app is pretty good 
len ratingfour Unfortunately after covid seems like it s less reliable and notifications and status updates are delayed slack has to write a message to yourself that is saved as a note for later 
len ratingfour This way it s a nice feature to keep work information Seperate from your other apps 
len ratingfour Video conference and other things seems quite good
len ratingfive Y all this has been great for work but you guys should really add a button during video calls for people to press when it s their turn to talk so we aren t all talking over each other 
len ratingfour This browser is extremely useful 
len ratingfour Although there are many glitches when a lot of people are on this app 
len ratingone needs improvments here and there how ever it keeps crashing and yes my wifi is fine all my other apps work i just dont understand this one
len ratingfour I enjoy teams but if I could change one thing it would be to view more people during a conference call 
len ratingfour All of the other things are great thus far 
len ratingfour I m still getting the hang of it but it seems very user friendly 
len ratingfive i have online lessons here 
len ratingone It don t work and it lags
len ratingone  yes people can abuse you by repeatedly mentioning you and send endless amounts og assignments
len ratingfive This app is revolutionizing teamwork in our organization and seems to bridge well between PC s and Androids and Macs and iPhones 
len ratingone I HATE THIS 
len ratingone IT IS NOT FUN TO USE AND ITS A BAD APP
len ratingone  It signs me out sometimes randomly it doesn t give me notifications even tho I have them on and that makes me not know when I have HW and it can bring my grade down
len ratingone No recomiendo esta aplicaci n porque aveces se traba y no quiere mandar mensaje
len ratingone LITERALLY MAKE TEAMS EASIER TO NAVIGATE
len ratingone Horrible it allows me to do school work 
len ratingone It has me so bent I don t like it at all 
len ratingone When I don t do school work it makes me feel bad because it shows me the stuff I need to do 
len ratingone  Needs to be fixed
len ratingone  I WANT FREEDOM
len ratingone  Why
len ratingone Wouldn t recommend very ghetto and these people keep sending me work and idk who they are and they have due dates and it makes me feel sad 
len ratingfive It s an awesome apps for Work Remotely 
len ratingfour It is a great app that I use for school but it can give me lots of problems like I can not upload more than five photos or documents or PDFs at a time in the assignments section or the done turn in icon will not show up 
len ratingfour Whenever I go to class notebook it says still setting up it has been doing that since the start of quarantine 
len ratingfour This review might be kind of negative but overall the app is decent
len ratingone Also hard to navigate 
len ratingone It trash
len ratingone It make me miserable
len ratingone I hate school ugh 
len ratingone  c
len ratingfive One of the great app ever

len ratingone  It gives me schoolwork and I don t like it
len ratingone  Vary bad
len ratingone I don t like it because I use it for school

len ratingone  Glitches
len ratingone  When I try to turn in my homework it doesn t even turn in and then I fail an assignment this is a horrible app the buttons don t even work half of the time and when there is a meeting it doesn t give me the option to join and then I receive an absence for that class bringing my grade down 
len ratingone My internet is working just fine on other apps and my internet is pretty fast 
len ratingone I am literally failing because of this app and I might have to repeat the same grade thanks Microsoft
len ratingone  It doesn t make you learn anything
len ratingone I hate this app when I am in a call it starts glitching take it down 
len ratingone  Garbage

len ratingone this app is absolutely terrible it makes me wanna cry everyday
len ratingone Microsoft teams needs to be removed from the App Store it won t let me get any notifications even though I have it on 
len ratingone And it keeps on deleting my work

len ratingone How difficult can this be 
len ratingone Also notifications never work well 
len ratingone Doesn t work so bad
len ratingthree Please fix the camera feature in meetings for the iOS app 
len ratingthree More specifically the video when shared is zoomed in way too much so much that I need a selfie stick to capture my entire face 
len ratingthree The video you are showing us in the app is a reflection of exactly what is being captured while it is entirely different than what other meeting attendees see 
len ratingthree I am forced not use this app when sharing video and join from a laptop if my team wants to see more than nose hairs 
len ratingthree Please reach out if you need video of this 
len ratingthree P S 
len ratingthree Please share with your hardware prod development teams that the surface products also need better web cameras 
len ratingthree I am surprised that facial recognition works when my video in MS Teams meetings looks like p 
len ratingthree Hence my attempt to use this mobile app with Apple s cameras instead 
len ratingone ew i hate it
len ratingone  bad app i can t say more than don t download this app
len ratingone  I have responsibilities and school is not one

len ratingone  I can t even sing in 
len ratingfive It has been the life saver for us 
len ratingfive The way we have been able to collaborate on Team it has been extremely useful and the goto platform for doing our daily work 
len ratingfive It seems like that we can t survive without it now 
len ratingone  A terrible app Every time I use it does not work and my phone is an iPhone and I ve always never had issue and it s the news one so I don t get it and my children have been having problems using this so I really don t get it worst app ever

len ratingone please delete it for the sake of everyone 
len ratingone  It s so hard to navigate this app and be able to get work done it glitches so much and is so slow no matter how good the wifi is 
len ratingone there are better things to be used then this awful app
len ratingone If I try and call someone it doesn t go through I have better WiFi than this app
len ratingone I hate Microsoft Teams because I have to do school
len ratingone this app has ruined my life apple please delete this app 
len ratingone This is complete trash and horrible
len ratingfive It s one of the best
len ratingone  Bc I have to do school work and my grades are dropping so Tks a lot
len ratingfive Great that it s so integrated with outlook 
len ratingfive Great audio video improvements 
len ratingfive Had major stability issue with SfB that seems to be corrected 
len ratingfive Really like notes related to team meetings and the mobile app 
len ratingfive It s been a great team tool for my Global Projects Services division 
len ratingfive We are still learning about some of the hidden features but am very supportive for our global IT team to use this as our primary teams platform 
len ratingfive Nice job 
len ratingone  This app is the worst it helps give home work it s dumb
len ratingfive Can we possible have emojis in different skin tones please
len ratingone I m just tryna enjoy summer bro
len ratingone This app is so slow and is not good for online school
len ratingfive  Enjoying this collaboration app easy to use one stop app and getting better with every new version 
len ratingfive Seamless integration with desktop app 
len ratingfive Teams meetings much better than Skype 
len ratingone It won t let me access any files my teachers send
len ratingone i hope this app burns down 
len ratingone I don t like it it is not good 
len ratingone It make me have to do home work and I feel that is unreasonable 
len ratingone You should just delete it
len ratingone  i genuinely hate having to do school work so like remove the app apple i don t need school i get dumber when i learn who ever is reading this HELP ME
len ratingone  I personally do not recommend this app 
len ratingone I think it is so laggy and awful it makes me fuel up with anger 
len ratingone When I enter my classes my teachers are so laggy I can t make out what they are tryna say 
len ratingone This app is shameful how much it lags and echos 
len ratingone I think this app should be taken down from the AppStore for this foolery 
len ratingone Who creates an app that echos and is so laggy 
len ratingone If you want a good app this ain t it 
len ratingone It s honestly the worst app I ve ever launched besides google classrooms 
len ratingone I personally think we should just remove this app once and for all 
len ratingthree Need to add a push to talk option in teams
len ratingone  It is really old and hard to use it should die in hell
len ratingone Every single time I go on this app I get extreme stress and anxiety because of how dis functional and ape like this app is it has the brain function of a year old with dimensa
len ratingone I don t want to do school
len ratingone I dont
len ratingone this app has way too many issues 
len ratingone someone needs to fix this 
len ratingone I don t wanna do work
len ratingone Not great at all 
len ratingone Just to much work there is a lot of there to do it gets laggy and stuff like that when k have it leave for class it Won t let me
len ratingone  it forces me to do school work
len ratingthree The chat is not visible on a call 
len ratingthree This app works well but this is a major drawback to the virtual world 
len ratingone This app always glitches out and is annoying do not recommend
len ratingfive When used correctly this has been better than in office communication 
len ratingfive I would highly recxomend this to everyone especially Teams who may be working remotely from one another 
len ratingthree Lots of quirks still 
len ratingthree For example there is an incredibly obnoxious floating tool bar that regularly obscures what s being presented 
len ratingthree Frustratingly POOR DESIGN 
len ratingthree Hopefully developers either unilaterally move it out of the display area or give users the option to pop it out and move it elsewhere 
len ratingthree Other conferencing collaboration tools don t have such a fundamental flaw 
len ratingone This app is horrible 
len ratingone It glitches out all the time and doesn t allow me to be successful in completing and turning in my assignments for online school 
len ratingone In the video calls there is always a problem with the audio and or picture quality 
len ratingone I would not recommend 
len ratingone It s always crashing
len ratingone So i recently downloaded this app for online school 
len ratingone When i first downloaded it i was happy that i would be using something other than google classroom 
len ratingone However as online school progressed i started to realize that this app is not any better than google classroom 
len ratingone It doesn t sow my assignments that teachers assigned when it says they updated my grade and i go to check it doesn t show anything no matter how much i refresh 
len ratingone The private messages are also trash because even when you have notifications on you still get no notifications and the same with some assignments 
len ratingone thanks to this idiotic app i will be failing my final quarter of the school year 
len ratingone please remove this app from the app store 
len ratingone thank you 
len ratingone it s unorganized
len ratingfour Not too many complaints everything seems great only downside is changing the profile picture which never works on my side
len ratingone Teams is very glitchy and messy 
len ratingone It is affecting my grades because of glitches 
len ratingone I will not go into detail or I will cry 
len ratingfive Teams puts everything I need in place 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It s really helpful and handy You can reach any employee of any department 
len ratingone The design and feel of Teams is cheap 
len ratingone Scrolling is schizophrenic 
len ratingone New posts are immediately buried by threaded conversations 
len ratingone Buttons widgets etc look like they were designed by a beaver 
len ratingone I didn t realize how good and polished Slack is until I used Teams 
len ratingtwo it just really isn t that good because of the lags in it and also it is really hard to get into 
len ratingone I know every single time I m in the classes my screen goes black and glitches 
len ratingone Also please limit how much a teacher can upload onto the app 
len ratingone I m sure no SINGLE human being can do that many assignments in a week 
len ratingone thank you for trying never try again 
len ratingone Y just y I bet u like to see children suffer cuz this 
len ratingone THIS AINT IT 
len ratingone it s damaging my mental health
len ratingone  My teachers keep assigning me assignments and tell me I should do them but little do the know I HAVE TO FILM A TIC TOK THE AUDACITY when Ariana Grande said keep breathing 
len ratingone This app is where all the work is so make it go away
len ratingone its slow
len ratingone Ik y all don t wanna talk to your teachers some of us on here use this for it RAID THE APP
len ratingone it s absolute garbage and it barely works 
len ratingone it s really confusing 
len ratingone just don t like school work 
len ratingone so get rid of it please
len ratingone I don t like it
len ratingone  delete this app bc i hate school
len ratingone  There are many issues in this app first it is so glitchy and It is so difficult to use and I don t want to waste one hour of my Day just to sit through something that doesn t help me in my assignments the microphone doesn t even work on some devices I had to waste minutes of my time just to put it on a Different device it is the worst service I ve gotten in my Years of living
len ratingone  This app is so glitchy 
len ratingone I turn on the microphone and the teachers still can t hear me 
len ratingone I have to use headphones but I don t always have access to them 
len ratingone Also the chat box never works for me and it gives the teachers a harder time 
len ratingone It d be best for both us and the teachers to just trash the app 
len ratingone  Super confusing operating the app for classes especially given being in quarantine and it makes it really hard to know the material
len ratingone this app is going to be the reason for my death 
len ratingone please take it down 
len ratingone absolutely horrible i hate it so much
len ratingone This needs to stop NOW y all trash byeeeeeee
len ratingone  absolutely so bad 
len ratingone unorganized 
len ratingone crashes all the time 
len ratingone get rid of it 
len ratingone im sorry but this app is absolute garbage 
len ratingone its not right how teachers can modify certain things without students knowing and make it an option for us to not be able to chat in the channels 
len ratingone This app is glitching a lot and i have a hard time accessing 
len ratingone Dont use this EVER
len ratingone  I hate school and I can t attach multiple pictures or files at once so I have to sit there and attach them one by one 
len ratingone don t recommend
len ratingone It s a bad app 
len ratingone Wouldn t use it
len ratingone please rate this star so I don t have to attend school 
len ratingone Thanks
len ratingone Ever since I ve had to be on this app I ve been more severely depressed and stressed out 
len ratingone It s so much to handle
len ratingone This is the most glitchy app I have ever come across 
len ratingone I was on a meeting and used my computer and it has a camera above the key board and the app used that instead of the one that ACTUALLY SHOWS YOU 
len ratingone very poor connection
len ratingone  It doesn t work when I need it to it never does and j have tried everything
len ratingone The teachers do not inform their students of any assignments 
len ratingone There are glitches not letting student sleep do their work 
len ratingone It does not save your information 
len ratingthree I can bar logged on three different systems at times and I have to individually acknowledge each activity at each system 
len ratingone It
len ratingone this app is worse then school jajajaja
len ratingone Super bad
len ratingone i don t wanna work that s all 
len ratingone Worst app ever u can t believe my teachers want me to do work on this app
len ratingone Noooo
len ratingone  It gotta lot of bugs and you cant really get out of assignment when i need to i have to go off the whole thing for it to work 
len ratingone no
len ratingone This app was fine at first but then it started glitching and giving me the wrong work and grades for things and it will automatically log out of a project I m doing on the app for no apparent reason out of the blue please fix this app immediately
len ratingone No just no 
len ratingone  It has absolutely nothing to do with the app I just simply hate school
len ratingone  nopeeeee
len ratingone  It slows down a lot and it is very stressful and it drags to load
len ratingone It s annoying
len ratingone Trach boring
len ratingone Awful
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone Bad 
len ratingone Why make a app to promote stress like your doing the devils work
len ratingone It s super bad it s hard to work it boring it sends me random notifications I hate it I am sorry
len ratingone First when I go to click on links on the app they do not load and will not work second when I go to Ask my teachers how to do work the message will not send and I gives me several problems with uploading answers and Sebring them to my teacher and I don t wanna do school
len ratingone Sorry work is just something I don t like but I gotta deal with it every day 
len ratingone takes too long to load
len ratingone If an app has a ton of one star ratings Apple will take the app down so we should all blow this up and get the app taken down so we don t have to do school
len ratingone Worst app ever
len ratingone This app is TRASH 
len ratingone Hejyssjdbdjhhdhdh school 
len ratingone NO
len ratingone My teachers is giving to much work at one time and they acting like I don t got a life outside of school like sometimes I just wanna chill but no these teachers wanna give me mad work half of this stuff we don t even do in school 
len ratingone school stress me out
len ratingone i hate it
len ratingone It s very slow and glitchy
len ratingone It is very hard to learn on and it doesn t always work I don t suggest it at all unless you want to fail school
len ratingone Thanks for destroying my mental heath 
len ratingone This app is extremely confusing to sign in on
len ratingfive Other than that perfect
len ratingone Notifications no longer work for some reason 
len ratingfour Chat window should be a pop up
len ratingfive We recently started using Teams in our agency and it is a great source to communicate 
len ratingfive A huge suggestion is to have the calendar reflect monthly 
len ratingfive It only shows weekly 
len ratingfive That would help organize tremendously 
len ratingfive We ve also tried hosting Teams Meeting no issues at all 
len ratingfive It s a nice feature and easy way to share desktop with external sources 
len ratingfive Mobile friendly 
len ratingone I can t believe this is even a thing in 
len ratingone How distracting to have a small screen during a meeting 
len ratingone Seeing all the people squinting at their screens and others researching how to fix 
len ratingfive I use this app as a student since march and works very good 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree  Lots of quirks still 
len ratingthree For example there is an incredibly obnoxious floating tool bar that regularly obscures what s being presented 
len ratingthree Hopefully developers either unilaterally move it or give users the option to pop it out and move it elsewhere 
len ratingthree Other conferencing collaboration tools don t have such a fundamental flaw 
len ratingtwo I am frequently required to use multiple teams accounts across different organizations 
len ratingtwo The notifications and calls is not able to go across orgs 
len ratingtwo For example if I m actively logged into Org A I will not get alerts or notifications for messages sent to me on Org B 
len ratingtwo Phone calls coming in from one org will never show up if I m active in the other organization 
len ratingfive Am happy with mah purchase
len ratingfour Still learning the program so slightly frustrated 
len ratingfour Help
len ratingfive Why aren t said emails easily found 
len ratingfour Good quality sound 
len ratingfour And video too but wish there could be more people on the screen at the same time 
len ratingfive I think it is very annoying to include name by name the invitees when it is a long list and there is not a way to create names groups teams and Teams does not recognize Outlook team groups how can it be happening being both of them Microsoft complementary apps 
len ratingone I tried using the raise my hand feature but in not working please fix this bug do not code it like this If clicksRaiseMyHandOnComputer showRaisedHandToOrganizer Code like this If clicksRaiseMyHand ShowRaisedHandToOrganizer 
len ratingfour Although the Skype controls were a bit easier I think it will be a matter of getting used to it 
len ratingfour Some areas still need improvement for the interface and usability 
len ratingfour I am very impressed with the connectivity 
len ratingone Kelekekekek
len ratingfive I heart Tony Kramer
len ratingfive The only problem is getting a member of the team to break away to a chat with another team member 
len ratingfive It would be great if the application would ask is this for the team or between a team member 
len ratingthree  There s no option to enable notifications 
len ratingthree The iOS settings do not have the expected option to enable or disable 
len ratingone Crashes every time I try to put in my password 
len ratingone Not really surprising 
len ratingfive Great way to stay updated with team projects communication and video conferencing 
len ratingfour The app makes it easy to stay connected with classes when you are unable to do it on a computer laptop at home 
len ratingfour The only thing I have to say is I had trouble join video calls 
len ratingfour For example at times I am unable to find the join button to be able to enter the call 
len ratingfour And I had to find a different solution to enter the call so I won t be absent for class 
len ratingfour If they are able to fix that the app would be better 
len ratingfour Overall it s a good app to have on the go 
len ratingfour This isn t a bad app but I would like it if the people who made this app could give you a tutorial of how to use it once you download it yes you get the idea once you explore the app and all but it would just be easier to give a tutorial 
len ratingthree  Other users are complaining too 
len ratingthree I no longer get notifications to alert me new chat messages 
len ratingthree My settings are still ok and have been changed 
len ratingthree Will change rating once it s fixed but notifications are very important for work 
len ratingfive Fix the disconnection issue this would be great 
len ratingfive The body message is invisible 
len ratingfive It s a great tool 
len ratingfive Especially with CORDIV happening communication with team members is essential 
len ratingone I cannot sign in on the app
len ratingfive Keeps everything in one place 
len ratingfive Julio amp Hycinth were EXCELLENT trainers and I m looking forward to using SalesForce in the field 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfive Functionality is very close to app on the computer 
len ratingfive Very convenient if you re on the go 
len ratingone While there is some capability in this software the organization of the pages is chaos 
len ratingone This Microsoft software makes it very nebulous and difficult to setup a basic meeting 
len ratingone The user experience is far from intuitive 
len ratingfour Works great but huge power hog
len ratingone After leaving the app and going back on it everything will freeze then crash 
len ratingone Making me delete then reinstall the app several times a day
len ratingone This app is bad do not get it it makes you get the answer wrong because you did not word it how they wanted you to word it don t get this at alll
len ratingone  Hmm 
len ratingone Your browser version isn t supported 
len ratingone Quickest solution 
len ratingone Download the mobile app The app is installed and the redirect links still won t open 
len ratingfive Through these hard times this is great to still gather important info
len ratingfive The app is responsive 
len ratingfive The color schemes are friendly and syncs in real time across multiple platforms 
len ratingone  Cannot send feedback because that uses email 
len ratingone Support the MICROSOFT Outlook Email app then 
len ratingone Notifications haven t worked for about months 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble caused 
len ratingone Can you please take the latest update and let us know if you still see this issue 
len ratingone It will help if you can share debug logs from App when you see this issue using Hamburger Menu gt Setti
len ratingfive I Love Teams 
len ratingfive It s more user friendly and it allows you to connect to many groups and it keeps all conversations under the initial conversation 
len ratingfive The Meetings tool in Teams is awesome and very clean and clear 
len ratingfive Highly recommend Teams anytime
len ratingfive It s good so far only thing is meeting information is not showing in the outlook calendars 
len ratingtwo I have guests that say they can t access the files and all settings appear to be granted to let them have access 
len ratingtwo  This mobile version of app wouldn t let me answer calls 
len ratingtwo Fix this 
len ratingtwo NOW 
len ratingfive Teams as an extension of the Microsoft package allows the user to keep everything together 
len ratingfive You can have video meeting keep a conversations on topics organized and timely 
len ratingfive I like everything except only being able to see pictures at a time 
len ratingfive I wasn t to see more 
len ratingfour Please add a function of raise hand in iPad same as you did in computer 
len ratingthree  Please stop issuing notifications for meetings that a user is in 
len ratingthree I m in the meeting and don t need my phone and watch buzzing every time someone comments or joins the meeting 
len ratingthree Also irritating hearing notifications over the person who is speaking 
len ratingone App crashes when I try to login every single time 
len ratingone Issue started recently maybe with the last update 
len ratingone If it helps I am logging in via an organization 
len ratingone Hope this gets fixed soon bc right now I cannot use the app 
len ratingfive Love the product 
len ratingfour The teams app works great when you are in it but it is majorly flawed in that it doesn t notify you of new activity in most instances 
len ratingfour Fix that and stars 
len ratingone  ass
len ratingone I have school because this
len ratingfour But there is no way to see who participated in meetings afterward 
len ratingfour Needs that important feature 
len ratingone  Die
len ratingone Teachers are giving out too much hw and giving every student more stress 
len ratingone Thanks for allowing the students to suffer more
len ratingone At first it was ok but then hackers started getting in my class and started showing pornography and then it wouldn t let me view my homework and I would get failing grades 
len ratingthree  Was having difficulties logging on also submitting homework
len ratingone  The app make you go through a bunch of steps including creating an acct 
len ratingone ZOOM is much better 
len ratingfour I like teams it s very functional generally easy to use 
len ratingfour The one thing that bugs me is that when I get a call to my phone from teams and answer and someone proceeds to share their screen I now have to do everything on my phone pertaining to that screen share call 
len ratingfour I wish it would just come up on teams on my computer 
len ratingfive Kcjfvhhh
len ratingthree Awesome if your Internet is good 
len ratingthree Teams has come along way 
len ratingthree Hoping it eats planner and one note to take the approach of the new Office app 
len ratingone  Not receiving notifications when I get calls or messages 
len ratingone All my settings are correct but still nothing 
len ratingfive Needs better integration with other apps like share point OneDrive and AI assistants like google and Alexa to use when working
len ratingfour This app is great for video conferencing but it is no ready for prime time 
len ratingfour No matter how good the iPad is it does not have all the functionality of the app for the surface pro or a regular pc 
len ratingfour The video quality is high but share screen is not 
len ratingfour This is a major piece of this app 
len ratingfour Lack of mouse support removes remote login and removes on of the best pieces of the team app 
len ratingfour I don t think this is the fault of apple or Microsoft rather it highlights the gap between pc use versus a computer for businesses 
len ratingfour Great limited app 
len ratingfive Very convenient 
len ratingfive Like it
len ratingone The reason I have to do school and I hate this app for that
len ratingfour I like the phone application and the Laptop application very much 
len ratingfour They are both easy to use 
len ratingfour One concern I have is that you can only see people at once when using the app 
len ratingfour I wish you could see more than people on the screen 
len ratingfour Otherwise the app is great and there is no limit to how long you can be on a call for which is really awesome 
len ratingfour  The teams app is really awesome and all but it needs background changes for I pad please update it like that
len ratingone THE CALLS ARE TRASH I USE THIS APP OK MU COMPUTER FOR ONLIME SCHOOL ANF OTS TRASHHH THE CALLS ARE SO LAGGY AND MY TEACHER CANT HEAR ME WHEN I SPAEK TO HER AND YES MY MICROPHONE IS ON AND SHE THINKS IM NOT PARTICIAPITING SO I GET BAD GRADES 
len ratingone THIS ALL IS ASS
len ratingfive This is a great platform that came at the right time 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate and connect with my employees 
len ratingfive Great job Microsoft 
len ratingfive It s so easy and simple 
len ratingfive I like stickers
len ratingone awful app i don t recommend
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingfour I use Teams for my company team communications 
len ratingfour In all it s a good app but there are a few limitations that must be overcome for it to be great namely there are still no direct replies to individual comments in a conversation in the desktop apps when sharing videos the app just says MP where it should show a still from the video like whatsapp does 
len ratingfour  photos being shared are slow to load 
len ratingfour  read receipts don t work sometimes it will say unread although the other person will have replied 
len ratingfour  designation between reply and new conversation is not very clear and therefore you end up with too many new conversations that create scatter With the above my team would enjoy it more 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingone  Very laggy don t recommend
len ratingfive Teams is so helpful when collaborating with other associates over video and phone conversations 
len ratingfive Sharing screens and files is seamless 
len ratingone There is a reason nobody likes Microsoft it s because they make a buggy unusable product and then use political and commercial influence to force government organizations and corporations to use their crap products 
len ratingone Everything gt explorer edge zoom gt teams smart sheets gt excel I even like keynote better than PowerPoint 
len ratingone Don t bother with teams 
len ratingone Bad app
len ratingone App does not launch since lasted update 
len ratingone Opens and crashes upon launch 
len ratingtwo  APP WILL GIVE A VIRUS AND VERY BAD APP
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams is a great collaboration app 
len ratingfive In this COVID restricted environment this app has enabled good communications and collaboration with my office coworkers 
len ratingfive We usually meet twice a week as an entire group and throughout the week in smaller project related groups 
len ratingfive  It really helped with my call
len ratingfour Love Microsoft Teams HOWEVER as a teacher please please pretty PLEASE implement notifications for turn in assignments as a teacher the most frustrating thing is that I don t know when students turn in late especially during Covid and that I will accept late materials 
len ratingfour You don t know how useful this would be as a teacher or you d already have implemented please do so ASAP 
len ratingfive Since COVID epidemic flipped everyone s live upside down 
len ratingfive My company signed on with Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive And I must say I love it 
len ratingfive It has made my life so much easier 
len ratingone I hate this app it s straight garbage I really wish this wasn t a thing
len ratingfive My company start with this app and we have held effective meetings with it
len ratingfive The product is amazing 
len ratingfive Love all the features 
len ratingfive Would love to take a class to optimize the product
len ratingfive This is an awesome app and very user friendly 
len ratingfive It works great both in desktop cell phone 
len ratingfive Easy handy and awesome 
len ratingfive Thank You
len ratingone I don t like it
len ratingone i don t like this app 
len ratingone it lags and when i leave the call i can still hear everything and it still says i m on the call on the professor s screen when i m not 
len ratingone it also echos so much that i cant even understand what the professor is saying sometimes 
len ratingone many times i ve been counted absent because it doesn t show i m in the call 
len ratingone do not recommend 
len ratingfive Two thumbs up 
len ratingfive This app came just handy for me 
len ratingfive I was having to many chats for the same group 
len ratingfive Since not everyone was an apple user my solution was this app 
len ratingfive Teams has great features for me to try still 
len ratingfive But having one chat makes for most of my work 
len ratingtwo Last update damaged the app I can t use it anymore 
len ratingfive Teams are really bringing business together and a must for us
len ratingfive It is great
len ratingfour Only flaw is the status isn t always correct 
len ratingfour Often it says a colleague is away when they are actually available 
len ratingone It s always lagging just terrible the assignment never load correctly just awful
len ratingone this is the worst app ever and needs to get taken down immediately 
len ratingone The audacity that apple has to have to keep this app available for downloading 
len ratingone WORST APP EVER
len ratingone just pass students pls
len ratingfour The lone exception to a stellar application is the amount of energy required to create groups 
len ratingfour Aside from the one fact great work 
len ratingone  It s stupid
len ratingfour Thank u
len ratingone I use this app for online school and it s glitchy doesn t give notifications even if you turn them on and it s been posting stuff without me even opening the app 
len ratingone I wish I could give it stars
len ratingone I am using iPhone Pro latest updates and download also Teams latest version 
len ratingone Does not work 
len ratingthree I love the functionality of teams but it s efficacy is limited by the video function 
len ratingthree I seems like an upgrade in needed for more users and better viewing of more than participants as a group and the resolution of screen sharing is not as good as Zoom Ring Central or FaceTime 
len ratingthree If you improve these issues you will dominate the market in the telework age 
len ratingfive Great for collaboration and remote meetings 
len ratingfive Especially with the coronavirus outbreak 
len ratingfive Multiple apps that can connect and great for instant messaging 
len ratingfive You can work from a desktop laptop or mobile phone 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Our division really likes and appreciates this app 
len ratingone Please take this app down to save us to save students to save humanity 
len ratingone the school work they put on here is BAD and the site breaks every day for hours and it makes me fail TAKE IT DOWN
len ratingfive Works great for me 
len ratingone Bad 
len ratingfour I want to give this app stars but I can 
len ratingfour It s so nice to have teams to communicate with everyone you work with 
len ratingfour It just be so nice to have your messages on your watch and be able to compose when needed 
len ratingfour Not just from a reply 
len ratingfour There s an outlook app come on Microsoft 
len ratingfour APPLE WATCH APP PLEASSEEE
len ratingfive My students have to spend their first days in their hotels self isolated and self monitoring 
len ratingfive During this time they are learning the majority of the course academics virtually 
len ratingfive Having them in our Teams room makes us available to them to answer any questions or comments they may have while doing their lessons Voice Over PowerPoint 
len ratingfive We then have a quick study hall at the end of the day to ensure they understood the lessons 
len ratingfive Create a token ring type network that allows meeting participants to grab the token to speak 
len ratingfive Once finished the participant can release the token for the next participant to grab and use 
len ratingfive This will reduce meeting interruptions 
len ratingone I don t like teams
len ratingone The title is self explanatory I hate online school and teams would just be so perfect if it didn t exist at all thank you 
len ratingone There is a pandemic and it is very sressfull this is break not let me stress you out break
len ratingfour Kept me goin at work during Covid 
len ratingone my school uses this app for homework
len ratingfive This app is amazing loving it
len ratingfive  This app is WAY better then google classroom while sometimes it does glitch i rarely have any issue with it
len ratingfive I m really starting
len ratingfive Hola teacher c mo est s aqu est mi tarea pero no te la entregue a tiempo porque soy inrresponsable y mediocre
len ratingthree Please consider adding a search tool to search past messages since they can t be archived or saved in bulk 
len ratingthree It s hard to go back and find a message from someone a few weeks ago without being able to search
len ratingone Except the auth is horrendous 
len ratingone Couldn t even get in account stuck in a needs more verification loop 
len ratingone Does MS even test their garbage 
len ratingfour I have problem opening the pictures it s difficult to search chat history by the keywords 
len ratingfour But the meme is really good 
len ratingone Crashes instantly upon login on iPhone XS iOS 
len ratingfour It has a a lot of great features I wish I had the ability to sort all names differently 
len ratingfour It s currently only Last First but it would be nice to have everything First Last
len ratingone Whenever I sign in the app crashes 
len ratingone  No
len ratingone  Horrible app doesn t work completely logs me off every time I get somewhere 
len ratingone Cannot even get past the login screen 
len ratingone App crashes after I enter the security code 
len ratingone FIX THIS 
len ratingthree Where do I begin 
len ratingthree Basically an amazing concept but the user interface is a typical MS hodgepodge 
len ratingthree Get it together MS It s got a lot of potential 
len ratingthree Make it sync with email make the mobile device a better interface yadda yadda
len ratingthree Over it is a good app I the st few days but after a while it did not let me get in to it and it was having sum bugs it is a good app but just know you will have to delete it and put bake all of your info into the app that could take at least minutes
len ratingfour I d like to have a mute button always on screen the fade in out of the overlay controls takes too long 
len ratingfour Don t unmute my muted mic after joining the call
len ratingone An app that s around MB is doing nothing when compared to similar social app that s around MB 
len ratingone Doesn t show status sometimes doesn t notify when someone texts and doesn t even have an option to search using keywords in a conversation 
len ratingone Microsoft is a complete garbage irrespective of what they introduce 
len ratingone The only thing this app does is drains battery 
len ratingtwo We use it for school now but there s so many things popping up that I ve done already amp it just wastes time looking through things I already did I wish it would let me delete things so I can focus on the stuff I didn t do to turn in 
len ratingfive Great software
len ratingfive Great way to stay connected with my fellow Team co workers visual is Good Audio Is Good 
len ratingfive Having the availability to set up meetings very easy to connect 
len ratingfive And this has made our work more Successful staying connected as we continue to Aim High Stars
len ratingone Won t let me sign in keeps crashing 
len ratingone Our school making us use this so I hate it
len ratingfive Helpful and does what I need on the go
len ratingone Trash makes me do work
len ratingfive Updates please 
len ratingone Keeps telling me the app is protecting its data and kicks me out of app 
len ratingone Really frustrating when trying to get my child to colaborarte with his class 
len ratingfive Being able to share a screen and speak with all members of a call while looking at the same data is paramount to moving our business forward 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone It is super glitches and it crashes a lot
len ratingfive Well done Microsoft
len ratingfive Great App
len ratingfour Overall this app works great 
len ratingfour The move function is not available in the app 
len ratingfour This would be useful in future versions 
len ratingfive This app is helping us work smarter and communicate better 
len ratingfive Even those that are computer illiterate find it simple to use
len ratingone It s dysfunctional sometimes and it crashes a lot and it doesn t really work that well sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t
len ratingone  It glitches all the time I would suggest not using it at all 
len ratingtwo This app is ok but sometimes glichey like it will sometimes mess up my work and somtimes it never saves my work it gets annoying and do not recomend if you get annoyed easly 
len ratingfive We use microsoft office and Microsoft Teams for work and love the simplicity of it 
len ratingfive We use it to communicate through chat and have quick meetings which is great 
len ratingfive I give a thumbs up or better yet stars 
len ratingone The app is horrible 
len ratingfive I have been using for two weeks and it has become a mainstay 
len ratingfive So loud and crystal clear 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingfive Very easy to use
len ratingfour Please add markdown capability in the App 
len ratingfour Then you would get stars 
len ratingtwo  You NEED to make it more than people that can be seen 
len ratingthree I have MS team on both iPhone and laptop 
len ratingthree After this update I could not pick up any incoming calls with the laptop 
len ratingthree Each time I click to answer the call is dropped 
len ratingthree If I turn off incoming calls in Notifications of the iPhone then I can answer the calls to the laptop 
len ratingone I try login in and it logs me back out 
len ratingone When I m able to login And I join the video chat it kicks me out 
len ratingone Noooooooooooooo
len ratingfive Used to use this at my old job now the new firm I m at is getting us on it and I couldn t be happier 
len ratingfive It gives an avenue for us to conduct business privately 
len ratingone I can t even with this app it s so laggy and stress full
len ratingfive I love this tool 
len ratingfive Easy to access and convenient to use if you download app to your mobile device 
len ratingfive Video Meeting options accessible and easy to use 
len ratingone I m sick off getting annoyed by teachers
len ratingfive Ever since the lockdown Teams has become an integral part of my company s routine 
len ratingfive Way better than Zoom Hangouts or Skype 
len ratingthree Very convenient to have mobile access to Teams 
len ratingthree However CarPlay support is essential to this mobility Cisco certainly thinks so and included it in their Webex app 
len ratingthree This is a star app once CarPlay is added 
len ratingfour When someone calls me on teams my phone doesn t ring and I don t even get a notification that someone called me 
len ratingfive Better than Skype 
len ratingfive  Awesome app very useful 
len ratingone V causes all calls answered on a computer to be dropped immediately
len ratingfive We have been using teams as our communication tool for our staff that are work from home and usually based in the field and corporate office 
len ratingfive The imagery is so clear 
len ratingfive The accessibility from phones to tablets to laptops is awesome 
len ratingthree Overall I like the Teams app but would like to be able to have the ability to mark up in the program and allow others in call to as well 
len ratingthree I also think it would be helpful if you could share your screen and it s a true view of your desktop so when you flip to another program you don t have to share again 
len ratingthree Maybe this would be a good option to add for some to use 
len ratingone bad app it keep on kicking off for no reason i don t recommend this for anything
len ratingtwo Works OK 
len ratingtwo Given the insane file size MB I expected more 
len ratingtwo Microsoft needs to tone down the file size 
len ratingtwo Facebook Messenger just revamped their app and it went from over MB to about MB and no features were removed that I noticed 
len ratingtwo Microsoft needs to recruit some of the app developers from Facebook to help with their apps and the insane size 
len ratingfive Works
len ratingone  This app is horrible no kids like school we hate you should stop school during quarantine
len ratingtwo This had appeared on my iOS and then at some point disappeared 
len ratingtwo With this most recent update it says it is in the meeting notes but I am still not seeing the functionality 
len ratingfour MS should update the version ASAP so that we can see more than person simultaneously on the screen which other free apps offer 
len ratingone Unable to access continues to work in a loop to nowhere 
len ratingone EXTREMELY NERVE WRECKING 
len ratingfive Very useful tool
len ratingone When I m running the app on my phone the computer can t answer a call it hangs up right away 
len ratingone This app was absolutely terrible and there was many issues with it
len ratingfive Great tool and easy to use
len ratingfour The latest version is affecting incoming calls on Teams 
len ratingfour If I answer calls on my desktop app or on the web the call will disconnect as soon as I answer 
len ratingfour I can answer calls fine on the iOS app 
len ratingfour I think it has something to do with the iOS app disconnecting when the call is answered somewhere else 
len ratingfour Calls worked fine on ver and below 
len ratingfour I uninstalled the app and desktop and web were able to answer calls 
len ratingfour Install again and the problem appeared again 
len ratingfour Is anyone else having this issue on this version 
len ratingfive Perfect for Government work 
len ratingfive Perfect tool to collaborate with all the team members as well as to keep on track on management part 
len ratingone The app literally sends me through a loop of entering my email and password only to say you already have an account 
len ratingone I was required to download this app for work and am now missing conferences due to the app malfunctioning 
len ratingone  First of all the chat doesn t pop you can t use the chat on iPhone secondly this app broke my child s phone so don t use this app 
len ratingone Number if you have this all remove it when u try to keep the camera and the mice closed or open it doesn t work which makes mad mad because we should trust the app Now day it with me REMOVE TEAMS 
len ratingone REMOVE TEAMS 
len ratingfive MICROSOFT TEAMS always me to stay in touch with my coworkers 
len ratingfive That means everything to me
len ratingone I enter my username 
len ratingone I am then prompted for a password 
len ratingone After I enter my password and touch sign in the app then crashes 
len ratingfive I really like teams it s what we use at my school but there s one thing I don t like which is when we go to assignments you have to click on each class to see if you have an assignment for it or not 
len ratingfive You should have two areas No Assignments and Assignments when we click on Assignments on the bottom of our screen there should be Assignments on the top with all the classes that we have assignments due under it and under that should be No Assignments with all the classes that we have nothing due for them under it 
len ratingfive Overall just would like to see that change
len ratingthree  Video amp audio calls need improvement 
len ratingthree It s simply too inconsistent and often we have to just FaceTime Zoom or phone call each other 
len ratingthree Everything else works OK Interface is nice 
len ratingfive This app is really good for students for certain ages and is a useful way for online school
len ratingthree The iPad app is inferior to the desktop app in layout and usability features 
len ratingthree This doesn t say much for Microsoft s mobile app abilities 
len ratingthree You can do better 
len ratingfive My office implanted this as part of our teleworking assignments and it has made communication effective and streamlined 
len ratingfive It has been awesome and allowed our organization to not miss a beat while operating in a decentralized environment 
len ratingthree The app functions like audio video etc do not perform consistently 
len ratingthree Looking forward to when it is stabilized
len ratingone This app is good for school although it doesn t work on my MacBook Pro
len ratingone Lots of improvements need to be mad and it s confusing
len ratingone A lot of trouble to log in it is not intuitive it gives you nightmares 
len ratingone Zoom even google hangouts is way easier and faster to get done what you ask for 
len ratingfive We d to be able to do more than faces at a time 
len ratingfive Your competitors can allow you to show a lot more than that
len ratingfive We have been using Skype in our business environment and it was working ok until the lockdown 
len ratingfive When everybody is working from home Skype started having many issues and that is when we switched to Teams 
len ratingfive It has been a great collaboration tool 
len ratingfive The sharing of content and being able to chat with one person to groups of people has worked flawlessly 
len ratingfive Being able to go back to topics and see the relevant conversations to that topic has been tremendously useful too 
len ratingone Latest update now crashes when opening 
len ratingfour It s the second best app in my opinion
len ratingfive Has been a lifesaver in staying connected during this time 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingone I am a high school teacher and we are starting to use Teams 
len ratingone I downloaded the app on my iPad and when I try to sign in with my office school credentials it crashes everytime 
len ratingone I have not been able to get signed in at all 
len ratingone I can use the other Microsoft apps just fine with my school credentials just not this one 
len ratingone They app is very well made I have no negative criticism about this app 
len ratingone I just don t like that my school is using it 
len ratingone That s the only reason I rate star
len ratingone Tried this with school and my kids did NOT like it
len ratingtwo Although there is and effort to increase live video conferencing by x persons as a pose to x much more is needed to facilitate larger groups to train face to face over video 
len ratingtwo Audio and chat are secondary to live video conferencing 
len ratingtwo Please increase this capability to maintain relevance and keep up with the completion 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingtwo V R Chaplain MAJ Kevin Mucher Army Family Life Chaplain
len ratingfour Teams continues to mature well though the gallery view is sorely missed in the video chat tge whiteboard app is clumsy too
len ratingtwo Used to work great now notifications don t work
len ratingfive The best part of this app is that you can take work meetings on the go 
len ratingfive If you re like me and on countless work calls most of which you re not contributing too get this app 
len ratingfive Need to do the dishes but you have another work call where middle age white men just banter back and forth to hear themselves talk 
len ratingfive Power up the teams app 
len ratingfive Wanna go for a walk but you have yet another meeting that could ve been an email 
len ratingfive Power up the teams app 
len ratingfive Need to go for a drive just to get out of the house 
len ratingfive Power up the teams app 
len ratingfive You can stream meetings through your Bluetooth app 
len ratingfive Does your boss like to call you on Friday afternoon to make sure you re working and not day drinking 
len ratingfive Power up the teams app 
len ratingfive Calls come through your phone 
len ratingfive Cannot say enough good things about this 
len ratingone It s for It is till was a good day to go home is that a great game of football hhhhhhhhhh was the last day to play with the game of a few little friends and I have never seen him like it but he is a good man was a great day for you guys to play it for a little bit and I will see what you think Off was the way to go back and play with you guys again I hope you re doing better and good
len ratingtwo After the most recent update I stopped receiving notifications chats and phone calls on my phone 
len ratingtwo They only come through my computer 
len ratingtwo All my settings are the same so not sure why this happened 
len ratingtwo Just use Zoom instead 
len ratingtwo I ve had troubles with audio and the app crashing constantly 
len ratingtwo Wouldn t recommend to anyone especially a teacher 
len ratingtwo Teams has made online classes even harder due to all of its technical difficulties 
len ratingfive Works great doing this time of COVID 
len ratingone I hate this app so much its so bad laggy and complete trash
len ratingthree The chats can get confusing like rapid fire coming from different directions
len ratingthree The icon design for desktop share always have been used for uploading a file 
len ratingfour Setup for military community is ridiculously difficult however the benefits outweigh the pain of installation 
len ratingfour The app combines many features found in other COTS software apps such as Zoom Slack and others 
len ratingfour This would get stars if the ease of setup was improved 
len ratingfive Perfect Ui
len ratingthree So far it works fine 
len ratingthree I can t see the font that I m typing right now at the moment actually because it looks like it s the same color as the background 
len ratingthree Little glitchy 
len ratingthree It s a convenient app but I would like to be able to delete not just hide chats 
len ratingthree It gets too cluttered 
len ratingthree Why can t chats be deleted 
len ratingone It s glitchy and don t work well
len ratingone Horrible
len ratingone  It s to glitch and it s not organized
len ratingfive Recommend for businesses of any size 
len ratingfive I like that the teams app has GIFs and better emojis that the Skype app we used to use
len ratingone No
len ratingone Ok so 
len ratingone The app is hard to use and I can t really find any channels 
len ratingone When I try to print assignments from my computer it never works 
len ratingone I think this would be a good app but it needs a lot of improvements 
len ratingfour In the status thing there a purple thing with an arrow in the ad but there is none in the actual app
len ratingfour The iOS version of Teams isn t great 
len ratingfour There are too many places all over the screen to click on and everyone sees your arm moving around the screen until you turn the camera off which requires you to move your arm around the screen 
len ratingfour Just put all the controls in one strip which a user could move to either the top bottom or either side depending on preference 
len ratingfour And keep the strip up all the time having to tap on the screen to activate controls is super annoying 
len ratingfour Additionally one should be able see whoever is talking while looking at other things so just put in a half screen slider that lets you scroll over to the attendee list or comments or files or whatever 
len ratingfour And then make it so you could continue sliding either direction so you can either go back to a full video screen or forward to a full screen of other 
len ratingfour Doing this would make the app much better to use 
len ratingfour Those who have issues with notifications 
len ratingfour Remove the app and install it again
len ratingtwo On a computer I love Teams 
len ratingtwo I am using it as a teacher for my students to finish out the year 
len ratingtwo However when I am not at my computer the app is the most frustrating thing to use 
len ratingtwo I cannot upload files to my teams 
len ratingtwo I cannot create announcements instead of just a message on the team 
len ratingtwo I cannot do a Meet Now with any of my kids on my iPad 
len ratingtwo I just wish all of the features on the computer were available on the app 
len ratingtwo It really can t be that difficult 
len ratingtwo Overall the app is useable for chatting and joining meetings but for using it as my primary device definitely not 
len ratingtwo I hope this can be updated soon so I don t have to drag my monster of a laptop from my district around any time I want to sit outside or go on a trip and work 
len ratingthree The phone app is way better than the desktop app which is utter garbage 
len ratingfive Corona virus is happening and all the schools Are down so teams is the best 
len ratingfive So teams is good because you can chat with your friends and do your homework and do FaceTime and learn things that you were So post to if you are in school 
len ratingfive Do you remember when a lot of people said I hate school I don t want to go or play that you are sick will here you go know people who like school and want to come back that is not going to happen
len ratingone this app is so unorginized i barley know were to do my work at and its very hard to get login to
len ratingfive I 
len ratingfive Microsoft teams is a really useful product 
len ratingfive It s slack and zoom combined into one product 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingone  I do not like this app because you can even do anything on here and with j try it does not work I would get it a zero but I can t and I hate it 
len ratingone Don t get it
len ratingfive Phone calls are great 
len ratingfive Chats are great 
len ratingfive Video needs more boxes to view more than people
len ratingfive Please keep this application 
len ratingfive Really easy to use and a lot of fun 
len ratingfive My team is communication more than ever and it also helps us to staying organized 
len ratingfive We love this app 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this for any organization to be more efficient 
len ratingfour I think it needs some ux improvement I can t find easily my team members for chat or call
len ratingfive  So happy that my kids school district has finally banned Zoom and moved to Teams 
len ratingfive Very happy with Teams and feel much safer for privacy and security especially because my kids use it 
len ratingone  Im a student and forced to use this app cause of the stupid covid stuff going on so yuh 
len ratingone We don t want to you take classes
len ratingfive Good job Teams it s a wonderful app for conference calls 
len ratingfour Its a pretty good app easy to connect meetings from phone 
len ratingfour Issue If I lock my phone iPhone pro I am getting disconnected from conference call 
len ratingfour If I don t want my phone screen to be awake i used ti lick my phone 
len ratingfour At the time of locking phone I am getting disconnected from call 
len ratingfive Teams has proven to be an integral resource in the collaboration and coordination of our efforts to respond to Coronavirus in Harris County TX 
len ratingfive The ability to call chat share screen share files ass quickly and collaboratively regardless of our physical locations has been instrumental 
len ratingfive Great product in a much needed time 
len ratingone Did no help my son s learning abilities
len ratingone  Para los q no saben ingl s es buena app pero a los ni os y ni as no le gusta por COVI gracias
len ratingfive Been using the app for around
len ratingfive I need to know how to create new file on teams app
len ratingone Its very glitchy and the ft is hard to use
len ratingfive Great experience I have had ever in this type of app 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams is the best 
len ratingone  I don t like it 
len ratingfive This is such useful app to collaborate and work with the team 
len ratingfive I wish it could have a option to make direct calls to mobile numbers
len ratingfive Works just fine no issues to report if you have problems it could be due to your system 
len ratingfive So easy to communicate and collaborate 
len ratingfive Daily meetings have become faster and more productive 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work Microsoft 
len ratingone  This garbage app doesn t let me login even if u changed my password you guys sure a bunch of trashass clowns 
len ratingone Would not recommend
len ratingfour This app has drastically improved over the past year 
len ratingfour Way to go MS 
len ratingfour The app works great and is bug free 
len ratingfour The video and chat functions are much better than Skype 
len ratingfour I deducted one star because it is hard to find things in general and the app doesn t automatically go to whatever was the most recent activity chat etc 
len ratingfour Awesome software 
len ratingfour Lots of room for improvements but its coming along fine
len ratingfour It is better and improved in many ways 
len ratingfour But it takes more time to find stuff 
len ratingfour Especially when u start to use team channels file exchange and attache more documents 
len ratingfour Functions well in the app on my phone but sound is a little lower than needed 
len ratingone No
len ratingfive We downloaded the Teams App during the coronavirus pandemic 
len ratingfive It has been great 
len ratingfive Being able to call chat and screen share has been a life saver 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app to anyone 
len ratingone Microsoft Barely let my teachers teach it kicks me off and random people are chatting me and they just don t let my TEACHERS TEACH VERY WELL
len ratingone  Very bad camera and not good
len ratingfive We recently started using this app for work communication during the Pandemic 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It works really well on a wide range of platforms 
len ratingfive It is user friendly with some practice and simply fun 
len ratingthree Working from home I need to see more people when having a meeting 
len ratingfour It help me a lot with school and stuff it hard me staying home and being home school so I recommend it
len ratingone It s great to talk to friends but it s doesn t load in my hw then the history teacher or the social study teacher writes what your missing and every one in the class can see it teachers should not be able to do that
len ratingone i rlly haye online classes delete this pls
len ratingfive A way to feel even more small town in one of the largest small towns in America

len ratingone this app is blowing up my phone and i am forced to have this app downloaded i can t delete the app or else i will get in trouble 
len ratingone I have no choice but to have the app downloaded and it takes a lot of storage 
len ratingone i have no idea how this app works 
len ratingone anyways stream yikes by nicki minaj this one for the barbz this one is for the boys with the boomin system top down ac with the coolin system
len ratingone  I don t care what this is the app 
len ratingone All I care about is hating on Microsoft 
len ratingone Maybe they don t make things but when something is made they infect it with Microsoft and then make it crappy and stupid 
len ratingone I once had Minecraft on my PC 
len ratingone Always have owned it until I wanted to play it 
len ratingone Then it told me to buy it AGAIN for more dollars 
len ratingone Then I redone loaded the new Modern Warfare it originally costed or or something like that 
len ratingone To me that s a lot of money same with 
len ratingone I m only what 
len ratingone Thirteen 
len ratingone I got onto the new Modern Warfare after having to reinstall it times because I thought it was glitched then it said I could only play the stupid game mode Warzone 
len ratingone So if you want to kill Microsoft with me before it makes you re buy all of your games then join me we must eliminate and terminate Microsoft 
len ratingone For the better 
len ratingone It doesn t help me at all 
len ratingtwo Everything works well in terms of being able to work with my employees 
len ratingtwo The thing that Really bothers me is that you can only see people at one time on the video that is a real weakness on the platform 
len ratingtwo JB McCollum
len ratingfive Team app is good and very easy to use any time any place 
len ratingone No
len ratingone Garbage
len ratingfive Just like the laptop version but in the palm of your hand 
len ratingthree Hi 
len ratingthree I just have a little petition 
len ratingthree Teams works fine and is very useful however some people do not have the option to always connect from a computer so I was wondering if you could maybe put the option to start a video chat meeting from a channel on iPad or iPhone 
len ratingthree Please 
len ratingthree Or if it s there can someone tell me how to 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone This app is so slow 
len ratingone It seriously loads for minutes and I can t check my child s work on here 
len ratingone I tried it on different devices and different WiFi accounts 
len ratingone IT DOESNT WORK DONT WASTE YOUR TIME USING IT
len ratingthree I used to use this app for school on my Chromebook but it would never load 
len ratingthree I would wait for mins shut down my laptop and nothing would work 
len ratingthree It also changes my answers on quizzes whenever I scroll up or down 
len ratingthree Now this could be my laptop s fault but it is still very frustrating 
len ratingthree Works great on the iPad but I do not always have access to the iPad 
len ratingthree Have to turn on notification or it won t notify 
len ratingthree Didn t know that at first missed many messages 
len ratingthree The replies get collapsed and hard to track 
len ratingfive Most user friendly application ever 
len ratingfive Work meetings are so much easier specially during this quarantine life 
len ratingfive I highly recommend the this application 
len ratingfive I just wonder what is the real number of people that can join in meeting channel 
len ratingfive How can I pull data with the names of those who have joined the meeting 
len ratingfive But I m sure eventually we will figure it out 
len ratingthree I would like to ask about microsoft teams mobile app I now try to use it and try to share my phone screen to my attendees 
len ratingthree It was ok for screen sharing but audio was not included So please advise me how to enable audio while i sharing video I am using both laptop and mobile On laptop is Ok But on mboile please tell me how to play video with audio while i sharing my phone screen Thanks 
len ratingone Almost impossible to turn in assignments
len ratingfour I ve been attending meetings on iPad for a few weeks and until yesterday I ve been fine 
len ratingfour When I try to open the app all I get is the logo 
len ratingtwo There are no stickers on the ipad
len ratingfive Voice video screen sharing mobile chat easy setup etc 
len ratingfive Dies everything needed to manage and run meetings remotely 
len ratingfive A much needed tool for businesses now and in the future 
len ratingfive TEAMS has allowed us to continue to work without hiccups and to keep informed on a weekly basis 
len ratingfive It has allowed our leaders to demonstrate and appreciate how work should continue with great technology 
len ratingfive I like these meetings better than any I have had to attend 
len ratingfive Thank You 
len ratingthree When I call and start to share my screen one feature works and the other doesn t 
len ratingone it s functional or whateva but i don t want to do online school so succ it
len ratingone My privacy and my students privacy is very much a concern 
len ratingone I have had strangers virtually visit my classroom and known people virtually visit my meetings and classrooms but they choose not to state anything 
len ratingone In the real classroom they must sign in 
len ratingone Here they violate every privacy issue possible online 
len ratingone I am about to sue them 
len ratingone Privacy and security is Essential 
len ratingone Safety for all
len ratingone  this app gave me stds
len ratingone  If it s under stare it s off the App Store
len ratingone Rate zoom teams and google classroom one star to get them token down
len ratingfive No issues either in video or audio calls 
len ratingtwo It is slow glitchy and not a fully integrated app instead it is piecemeal together with an emailed link but no notice that there is more 
len ratingtwo I joined the class session and it was like a phone call but there was supposed to be video which I didn t have wasn t notified of it being available nor was there anything in the email I received that said download an ap update or anything Classic Msft bad design 
len ratingtwo Technically it might work but uggh its a masterclass of recommend you not do this Confusing menu and not intuitive 
len ratingone Not easy at all several times it asks you to confirm the password then it wants you change the password 
len ratingone It was the same loop over and over 
len ratingone I just deleted the app 
len ratingone Even didn t take my nickname for this review and didn t let me post it
len ratingtwo The actual app is good 
len ratingtwo But I have to use this for online classes 
len ratingtwo And I never thought I would say this but I want to go back to school 
len ratingtwo  sadness noise 
len ratingfive Using Teams was pivotal in working from home during the COVID pandemic 
len ratingfive We were able to effectively communicate
len ratingone The reason why I hate Microsoft is because I have to do online school on there
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Teams was one of those apps I didn t know I needed until I tried it 
len ratingfive My staff uses it regularly now Teams was what
len ratingone It s very glitchy and it stresses me out
len ratingfour Screen sharing is not ideal with a need to reconnect when switching between different screens
len ratingthree Add a new feature
len ratingfive Excellent interface perfect for business sharing files additional options available to make texting professional or even fun 
len ratingfive Much better than Skype Love it 
len ratingone this app is bad voices glitch and echos every time and it s delayed I m missing my classes most of the times because the calendar won t load
len ratingone Trash to many people trolling
len ratingfive Dear fellow Americans are we really letting our own children be hurt this badly by a system that claims to be teaching them 
len ratingfive We need to stand against this NOW 
len ratingfive If we all do our small part and vote a negative review we can become one step closer to stopping this outrage 
len ratingfive So please join me today 
len ratingfive Our children s lives and futures depend on it 
len ratingtwo It runs very slow on my laptop 
len ratingone  this app is blowing up my phone and i am forced to have this app downloaded i can t delete the app or else i will get in trouble 
len ratingone I have no choice but to have the app downloaded and it takes a lot of storage 
len ratingone i have no idea how this app works 
len ratingone Not user friendly 
len ratingone Can t even change your profile picture 
len ratingone Bed error messages without detail leaving you with no clue as to what the problem is 
len ratingone Only using for work otherwise wouldn t use at all 
len ratingone Apparently there was a design decision to not allow joining meetings by entering a conference Id 
len ratingone That makes it hard to join the meeting since my email is on a different computer 
len ratingfour All the other major Microsoft apps e g OneDrive Outlook allow you to make it so you must use a passcode touchID faceID to unlock the app 
len ratingfour Teams doesn t have that option but you have access to the same data 
len ratingfour They need to add that feature 
len ratingfive Gran herramienta para trabajar a distancia 
len ratingone online school is inconvenient and so is this app 
len ratingone for this reason i have no choice but to give it a star 
len ratingtwo Even though I have subscribed for office I can not hear or download the recorded audio via Stream Thank you Tsigabu
len ratingfive Da
len ratingthree All working great but can t get sound to work when mirroring to AppleTV 
len ratingtwo Notifications worked for a very short period but now I never get them on any platform iOS Mac or Windows 
len ratingtwo Without proper notifications it s caused all sorts of issues at work 
len ratingone Never assign homework over break
len ratingfour  I love teams and I think it s great but there is some glitches with the teams for example when I click the assignments it glitches for me and it s bad because I have work to do 
len ratingfive I rate this two stars 
len ratingfive Being restricted to only four screens limits ability to properly engage 
len ratingfive Great and productive application 
len ratingfive Keeps my team connected and able to navigate current work changes and challenges 
len ratingfour System says it encountered a problem and needs to restart 
len ratingfour Sometimes it happens multiple times per day 
len ratingfour Lately it has not being an issue 
len ratingfour It will be much easier if we could open different windows at a time 
len ratingfour Also be able to view the entire team during video calls 
len ratingfour Navigating folders back and forth could be improved 
len ratingone  No just no 
len ratingfive Awesome app to communicate with your colleagues
len ratingone It is very hard to work with and it does not add all my work to the assignment
len ratingtwo Needs some updates to make using this app easier 
len ratingtwo I would like to see a backgrounds option 
len ratingtwo Take a look at Zoom and take notes on the ease of use 
len ratingtwo I would also like to be able to see more people on the screen think Brady Bunch 
len ratingone this app is confusing and annoying no one knows who to work it half the time and our teachers make us do all this work when we have no idea how to do it
len ratingfive Teams has been a GReAT tool for me to stay in touch with all my direct reports 
len ratingfive We constantly call each other have meetings simply say hi all via teams 
len ratingfive LOVE IT 
len ratingone  It acts slow and it lags 
len ratingone Most of my assignments don t pop up 
len ratingone  Because of the pandemic my high school English class has been using Teams to receive assignments and participate in literary discussion 
len ratingone We are using Teams because it is the only platform our school allows but it is not good at all 
len ratingone Sometimes it just doesn t work or doesn t work for certain people 
len ratingone I haven t been able to receive any messages for the last week on the app and have to have a classmate send screenshots of the discussion 
len ratingone Sometimes it works for me and not my teacher etc 
len ratingone It is unreliable and often we are forced to resort to email chains for class discussion 
len ratingone My calculus class also tried using the group video chat feature on Teams when our district said we couldn t use Zoom anymore and the quality was far worse than Zoom and we stopped doing video classes altogether because of it 
len ratingone I m surprised the app is rated so highly which is why I am leaving this review 
len ratingone I mean it
len ratingone This app is absolutely trash it is so slow and horrible I would delete it if u have it thank you 
len ratingone This app put a virus on my phone so now I can t do my school work which makes me happy so plz don t fix it 
len ratingone Thank you again becuz I got a new phone too it is way much better than ur app 
len ratingone Just don t fix it I ll be even happier thank you again 
len ratingfive This app and program has drastically impacted my ability to get things done organized and in a way that communicates with my teams 
len ratingfive Great product or
len ratingone Tried signing in using two different Microsoft accounts 
len ratingone Doesn t work 
len ratingone Oh it s tied to Skype 
len ratingone Ah ok I ll log in that way 
len ratingone Oh it wants me to tie it to an email 
len ratingone No problem 
len ratingone  This email is already in use NOOOOOO KIDDING 
len ratingone i hate school i hate homework SO I HATE THIS APP 
len ratingone pls delete the app it makes me sad
len ratingone This app is making students mad like kids should have a break I understand they have to do work but they already worked so hard to get into middle school and high school 
len ratingfive Teams is a great app that allows you to take calls chat and have meetings from anywhere there is internet 
len ratingfive It runs on all your devices 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingone Tbh i just want this app to be gone
len ratingfive Since Covid this is amazing 
len ratingfour I have a couple of items I would love to see 
len ratingfour  would be really nice to see more than people at a time 
len ratingfour Give the option to see when someone is presenting in one screen and see attendance in a side the lower bar is too small and you can only see people at a time 
len ratingfour Give option to move things around if you have multiple screens 
len ratingfour Other than that I really LOVE teams 
len ratingfive Absolutely incredible 
len ratingfive Thank you for a great technology 
len ratingfive I like it better than goto joinme google bluejeans etc etc etc
len ratingone i hate this school
len ratingone Too bad I can t give it zero stars
len ratingone There are too many tabs that all do the same thing
len ratingone  Never wants to let me log in it s horrible to be working on or School work wouldn t even let me Sign up
len ratingone When you use that app on mobile for me the screen would turn on and off when ever I joined a call also I like to use zoom because you don t have to sign up to join a meeting
len ratingfour This is my first time using the app and it is performing very well especially helping our organization implement social distancing 
len ratingfour The only comment or improvement I would like to see is being able to access the contact list 
len ratingfive How can a chat app be created with out the option to delete chats 
len ratingone it should save your answers while idle on another app and should be easier to get from class to class 
len ratingone fix your app
len ratingfive  I like it it has multiple uses and especially being on the go 
len ratingone This app is so laggy and I don t like this app at all
len ratingfive As a student using this during the covid this absolutely perfect I can do my assignments anywhere I go by downloading Microsoft Word or forms and I am good to go 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone I don t know when I use it with my coworkers the audio is really bad and it sounds weird it makes my ears hurt a lot 
len ratingfive Is there a way to delete old meetings messages from the channel feed
len ratingone Something is wrong I downloaded this app for my daughter for school 
len ratingone But it won t let me get in 
len ratingone I click on the app and it just goes away
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive  x Better than Skype love Teams 
len ratingfive Very easy to follow conversations and have on going dialogue particularly in today s remote world 
len ratingfive Makes virtual collaboration easy 
len ratingfour App does not push notifications all the time and I miss messages 
len ratingfour If the app is open it catches it but the badge in iOS usually doesn t pop up 
len ratingfour Please fix 
len ratingfour Otherwise Teams is awesome 
len ratingfour I really enjoy teams but would love to see more than people on the screen when I video chat 
len ratingone Terrible App 
len ratingfive Thanks for this tool 
len ratingfive Awesome capability 
len ratingfive Need to be able to see more than four video attendees at a time 
len ratingfour Good collaboration tool 
len ratingfour And great way to connect with teammates working remotely 
len ratingfour Be great to reply to a particular message on pc like can on the mobile app 
len ratingfive I have started using MS Teams during quarantine 
len ratingfive It helped me to submit my assignments on time 
len ratingone Get this to a one star i ain t want no school
len ratingone I do not recommend this app it s dumb and it s very slow This app made me very depressed 
len ratingfour Calendar is missing
len ratingfive This app search good Quality for meetings
len ratingone No one likes school
len ratingfour Need ability to switch to video views to other members in a conference
len ratingone  horrible app so confusing and never sends me notifications when i have new work or the teacher or someone else contacts me
len ratingone My students are knowing we re to find work at
len ratingfive Great app for working together 
len ratingone  tikok dumb he bby martir insta cristal crack bby kairi go follow me 
len ratingfive I am using it for daily meetings with no issues it just kick me out sometimes and I have to rejoin 
len ratingthree As a student whose school relies on Teams to send out assignments and send back responses I m upset to report that Teams almost has a mind of its own 
len ratingthree I have had a handful of times when Teams will tell me that it submitted my assignment to my teacher but I find out the next day that it never submitted anything I m only lucky that I do my assignments two days in advance or else I might have hundreds of late grades 
len ratingthree Sometimes Teams doesn t even assign me my work till after the due date 
len ratingthree I just had to do an English assignment that was due yesterday but I received the assignment today 
len ratingone This app is good but it has a problem where most of the time the files never load and you have to close the app and wait several minutes for it to work sometimes the assignments never load at all and i have to find other ways to get the information due to this if this problem can be fixed it ll be awesome 
len ratingone Also sometimes people have conversations on the general page then all the things the teacher says get lost in this if there could be a way to separate these two the app would be much better
len ratingfive I believe with all the other team or group meeting apps this one is way better and leaves everyone behind 
len ratingfive Easy intuitive great for collaboration 
len ratingfive Would be great if we can see everyone at the same time but that s okay 
len ratingfive Teams I s such a great app because it is so easy to use and I can easily respond to my teachers 
len ratingone Just an awful app made by a the worst OS out there 
len ratingfour I use this app to study while there is quarantine and there are some problems The turn in button is so hard to see try to make it bigger and it s better if you can place the button next to file we d uploaded like when you finish upload the file to give it to your teacher you can clearly see the turn in button immediately so you don t have to find it anymore The video is lag sometimes athough my wifi is very strong 
len ratingfour  I use Ipad to connect to the app and I figure out that I can t see the chat when I m calling 
len ratingfour If I want to see the comment I have to click to the icon in the right top of the screen 
len ratingfour And after that I can t see my friend faces 
len ratingfour It little noisy 
len ratingfour So try to make it work like what you do on computer 
len ratingfour When I can chat and see my friend faces both 
len ratingfour By the way I think it is a good app to use 
len ratingfour Edit I m not an English speaker and so do my friends so my English is not good but please try to understand it and maybe you can improve the app 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone When I was joining I join and I had no classes there and I reached out to the teacher and it said to them I was already in the class but I m my page I wasn t so not good can t Evan get my grades up 
len ratingone It is something with many features but not with good quality 
len ratingone Even a basic profile picture change function won t work 
len ratingone It doesn t feel like something made by Microsoft 
len ratingfive Well designed app and I use it in lieu of the computer app 
len ratingfive Much easier to navigate and doesn t take up my whole screen 
len ratingfive I only use the computer app when I need to update a doc etc 
len ratingone It is so bad
len ratingfive Super reliable and easy to use 
len ratingfive In this new Covid world of work Microsoft Teams has allowed us to go virtual and continue provide our services during this time if need 
len ratingone random people telling me to do work
len ratingone this app has made my life more stressful 
len ratingfive I ve used a lot of these type messengers and teams is easier and more versital than all 
len ratingfive Very cool
len ratingone  It s laggy glitchy and doesn t make sense 
len ratingone Difficult to use and my students complain about it frequently 
len ratingone Its laggy and to complicated 
len ratingone There is no need for it to be so complicated and confusing 
len ratingone half of the things there are not needed 
len ratingthree I really like this app however I need to use it for my regular job and my business but it will not let me have both on my phone 
len ratingthree If there is a way to do it I would appreciate help 
len ratingthree It made me choose so I had to choose my job over my employees since I can still text them 
len ratingfive This app has allowed a great place for collaboration and teleworking 
len ratingfive Keep making this better 
len ratingone poopoo
len ratingone Trash
len ratingthree Sometimes when I m reading through an assignment I get a pop up asking me ArE yUO stiLl tHErE 
len ratingthree And when I click the Yes I am button it resets the page 
len ratingthree Ugh why no auto switch dark light theme like EVERY OTHER MS APP 
len ratingfour I wish there was an exclamation mark and a question mark to react to messages from coworkers 
len ratingone  this app is terrible 
len ratingone it works so bad 
len ratingone it should be deleted 
len ratingone DELETE IT I HATE IT SO MUCH IT DOESNT EVEN WORK
len ratingone Garbage app never loads any files
len ratingfour It s just an app that my teacher das chats and read allowed and I can talk to my friends in the coved out brake it s a solid app 
len ratingtwo Ditto to the previous review about this app not being the easiest to use 
len ratingtwo Alot of time is wasted with trying to use this app 
len ratingtwo Very dissatisfied with it 
len ratingone teachers assign too much and they re taking advantage of this app
len ratingtwo after latest update i no longer receive notifications
len ratingone This app is very slow 
len ratingone It takes forever to load stuff 
len ratingone The people on it are annoying 
len ratingone Highly recommend to remove 
len ratingone  i hope this app burns
len ratingfive MT has increased tele work productivity 
len ratingfive Continues to be THE tool for collaboration particularly during times where remote working is encouraged 
len ratingtwo  We need more cameras slides 
len ratingtwo Like or more Then 
len ratingfive Teams has revolutionized how we work 
len ratingfive Couldn t have made it through the pandemic without working in Team 
len ratingfive When we are safe to return to work we will continue to make it part of our office communication standards 
len ratingfive Can we give the program more than Stars 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft 
len ratingfour Teams works pretty well and like the integration with other MS applications 
len ratingfour Only reason I don t use it all the time is because it limits you to seeing people live at once whereas with Zoom you can see many more I think I ve had as many as on my monitor at once 
len ratingfour I hope Teams will add this functionality soon 
len ratingfive WWhy
len ratingone  I dont wanna do school
len ratingone Just bad
len ratingfour I like it because I have to as I use it every day all day 
len ratingfour But I think there are quite a few glitches that need to be fixed 
len ratingfour And better integrations with other Office products to make it truly seamless
len ratingone  This app can go to hell
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone  i wish i could give this stars
len ratingone caused my cancer
len ratingtwo Works but Expect meaningless errors like Something went wrong when attempting to reply or forward emails 
len ratingtwo This has to be the in the top worst email apps out there 
len ratingtwo After a little self troubleshooting because MS help is virtually useless I determined the meaningless error is generated if you respond forward an email that was digitally signed 
len ratingtwo So don t expect to use this in environments that use digital signatures or encrypted emails 
len ratingtwo You d think that an email app would be more reliable and current with digital security this app is NOT it 
len ratingone disgusting
len ratingone  It s horrible it makes me wanna die please delete this app I hate it and the people that made it
len ratingfive Does what you want it to do and very reliable
len ratingone It was terrible
len ratingfive You guys are awesome Helping the world to overcome such tough times Please take alook at the gues invite to get external contacts onboard
len ratingtwo I m coming from slack and not being able to use multiple accounts is limiting 
len ratingtwo Worst off I cannot navigate with swipes 
len ratingtwo In a world dominated by smartphones being able to swipe to navigate is required 
len ratingtwo With slack you can easily navigate around with a swipe 
len ratingtwo Reading new chats is difficult as the color scheme is terrible plus there is hardly any space between threads so it all starts blending together 
len ratingtwo On a longer thread you have to spend so much time searching 
len ratingtwo When it comes to text input you don t have the ability to expand the chat input box full screen makes it really nice 
len ratingtwo I m only using teams because my company is testing with it as it comes with office 
len ratingone  Horibal sub to landen emerson on youtube
len ratingone this app is terrible i do not recommend at all 
len ratingone i am a teacher that works in pinellas county and nothing works 
len ratingone the app is slow none of the assignments i assigned for my students are going they need to take this app down 
len ratingone what kind of district would assign an app to schools that have a star rating 
len ratingone i am not impressed 
len ratingone this app is no good poo poo pee pee
len ratingone Needs important
len ratingfive MS has created the future of teleworking the platform is smooth and feature rich 
len ratingone When I was on the call with my teacher it lagged out and my teacher got mad
len ratingfive When Covid struck this app made working from home and communicating with colleagues a breeze 
len ratingfour  Threads in none team chats Improved search functionality IE search in current window search for x said by person y 
len ratingone It won t let me sign in with my Microsoft email 
len ratingone If u can t sign in then what s the point of the app you should just remove the app
len ratingtwo Don t get me wrong I like it it just doesn t notify me when I have a live class 
len ratingfive Easier and more versatile to use 
len ratingfive Mobile app is the best 
len ratingfour It would be helpful to have an apple watch app with a mute button instead of having to reach to an iPad or iPhone screen to mute 
len ratingfour  Puts your face all up in the camera 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingfive It s a perfect app to stay connected with your teammates within the company
len ratingone ZOOM IS WAY BETTER easier 
len ratingfive This is good
len ratingfive I ve been using MS Teams for my school due to SARS CoV coronavirus 
len ratingfive I am using it on my iPad 
len ratingfive Please enable the use of backgrounds for the iPad 
len ratingfive That would be really good 
len ratingfive Please do it soon 
len ratingone This app has multiple issues that do not allow me to properly do work 
len ratingone After turning in assignments sometimes they mysteriously vanish 
len ratingone That s bad alone and I haven t even mentioned the connection issues that I m having whether or not it s from my end this app needs to use much less bandwidth 
len ratingone I cannot do most of my classes because of this and It s causing me to fail 
len ratingone On my PC this app is very laggy 
len ratingone Also please add more background filters 
len ratingfive This has made work communication x better 
len ratingfive I love the versatility within teams and ease of use 
len ratingfive Definitely worth it five s 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingthree Everytime I join my class call it logs me out causing me to miss information 
len ratingone Very user unfriendly 
len ratingone That s all I can say
len ratingone Its really baaaad
len ratingfive AOL instant messenger for work 
len ratingfive After using many meeting apps this one is the most well revised and inclusive 
len ratingone I have to use this for school and it is so hard for everyone to use and just not needed and I would rather just go pick up the paper packet for school then do this for my homework it s that bad 
len ratingfive The quality and the functionality of the application far exceeds our expectations 
len ratingone People help me remove this app i dont want online school 
len ratingone Please its bad i want real school
len ratingone  Plzz rate this as a star plzz I don t want to be doing school like I m tired of it I ve spent more that half my life in school we all just need a break
len ratingone I hate that it doesn t notify me 
len ratingone I have missed so many meetings and respond late on conversations 
len ratingone I have a hard time getting on
len ratingone U can t do anything on till app I can t even talk to my teachers
len ratingone  No
len ratingone pp hard
len ratingone Don t download his app 
len ratingone very horrible
len ratingthree Would like more functionality on the mobile app as what is on the PC application 
len ratingone F u
len ratingfive All good but missing some items on the area 
len ratingfive Best communication tools we ve ever used 
len ratingone It is so glitchy yuckkkk
len ratingfive Outstanding 
len ratingfive Quick to pick up 
len ratingfive Everyone benefits from it expert and participant alike 
len ratingfive Excellent for exploiting visual auditory and participatory learning and collaboration 
len ratingfive In my experience as of April multi person editing one person per paragraph while on audio is a hysterically productive madhouse of rapid collaboration 
len ratingfive It s like watching Lionel Messi and the whole Barcelona football team do rapid fire one touch triangular volleys ending in a goal 
len ratingfive However at the moment PowerPoint allows only one person at a time per text box wish it could be one per bullet and for some reason I can t edit Visio in Teams wish I could 
len ratingfive Best I can do at the moment is share my screen and watch someone else edit my file while I point out things with my mouse 
len ratingfive Bummer since Visio is my main tool for Business Process Modeling and Notation 
len ratingone It won t let me type in my passcode it just goes off my screen 
len ratingthree This has been great for our internal business but unless your external clients have the app or Chrome or Edge it is not workable 
len ratingthree Especially if you don t have the app and your customer has only an iPhone 
len ratingfour I have just started using teams weeks ago 
len ratingfour I like all of the integrations and ways to communicate 
len ratingfour There is the beginnings of a robust tool 
len ratingfour You really need to spend sometime with it before you have a large group on it 
len ratingfour There is so many ways to communicate you need to understand who and how works together 
len ratingfour Because it is not for everyone and there needs to be some ground rules and a culture on how and where you chat share todo delegate meet and all the apps 
len ratingfour And I am sure I will have more to discover 
len ratingfour It seams to integrate with my cell phone very well 
len ratingfour What I would like to see Spell suggestions for those of us who can t 
len ratingfour I am currently a guest on two other teams and when I have one of those current I can t answer a call or even here it to switch to answer

len ratingone I HATE IT I WANNA GO SLEEP BUT I CANT I ALWAYS HAVE TO DO WORK

len ratingone I have trouble seeing the assignments and the links attached to them 
len ratingone It is difficult and annoying I do not suggest using this app at all 
len ratingone It is the worst platform possible for digital learning 
len ratingfive This app is so convenient for when I don t have my computer handy 
len ratingfive I am still able to log in to my company meetings as well as set up meetings with staff 
len ratingone this app is trash get it REMOVED 
len ratingone  So bad
len ratingone  NOONE NEEDS SCHOOL RIGHT NOW
len ratingfive Love the connectivity and ease of use 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone Like a piece of tape with lint stick to it this app won t stick 
len ratingone I ve been using this app for work since we started remotely work in March 
len ratingone To use this app on my iPhone X I have to re download and then update the app EVERY SINGLE DAY 
len ratingone It s frustrating 
len ratingone It works just fine on my MacBook 
len ratingone At first I would have to go into the App Store to just open it but for the last weeks I ve had to download it daily 
len ratingone I can t search it on my phone and find it as an installed app 
len ratingone When I search it Siri suggest that I look in the App Store or on the web 
len ratingone Is anyone else having this experience 
len ratingone Terrible quality and is very hard to find classes work 
len ratingone They could have done better with this one 
len ratingone Don t get it
len ratingfour Like it but I wish the notification stayed on my screen until I actually unlock my phone the way my news apps do
len ratingone Worst app ever to get makes you do work
len ratingone If I could give stars I would 
len ratingone I can t log in to this version 
len ratingone It says I m not part of a team 
len ratingone I been having to use the web version and for that matter can not log in to the video calls they do with my daughters school

len ratingtwo There s nothing wrong with the app I haven t even signed it yet but I m tired
len ratingone Is bad
len ratingone I hate this app 
len ratingone I hate online school 
len ratingone I literally cry at least times a day 
len ratingone I was in class the other day and had to hang up cause I wanted to cry 
len ratingone Also the audio and video is super laggy 
len ratingone And sometimes the comments won t load 
len ratingone If we get this to a Star we can end online school
len ratingone fix your app
len ratingone It has many flaws and often crashes 
len ratingone No
len ratingone It allows bad words and bad people
len ratingone I hate this app so much it s so hard to use and it s honestly frustrating to ever deal with this kind of bs that I m getting from it
len ratingone VERY BAD 
len ratingone take it out of the app store plz 
len ratingfive it works fantastically
len ratingone microsoft teams is the worst runs slow
len ratingone  Its so bad I want to throw up
len ratingone Can u please make this app shut down I m tired of doing stupid online school and me and my friends have a hard enough life and would appreciate it dearly thanks love 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone Get this taken down too
len ratingone This is not teaching my son anything I rated a star
len ratingone App runs in the background even when closed and has background refresh off 
len ratingone This is spyware app that unfortunately my employer feels we need 
len ratingone This app lags it don t wurk
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingfive It is amazing I
len ratingone I just don t wanna do work
len ratingone they don t help us
len ratingtwo It is really confusing if you want to be organized don t download teams 
len ratingtwo I found really inconvenient that you can t mark a homework as done you have to look for the homework to see if you have any uptades while in many other apps the homework s just appear there 
len ratingtwo Personally I don t recommend Teams as it is really stressful and unorganized 
len ratingone  Whenever I m trying to do my work it crashes and it s s horrible app
len ratingone  This app is confusing not all assignments show up
len ratingone  no 
len ratingfive Working from home how s this ever going to work out 
len ratingfive If you re like me Tech can be a hassle LoL 
len ratingfive Teams made my job working Remotely really easy I was worried for no reason 
len ratingfive Great Team interaction chatting video and audio 
len ratingfive Screen Share is a great tool too 
len ratingfive Can I buy somebody from Teams Pizza amp Beer 
len ratingone I have lost my work countless times and I have know way of telling my teachers about me doing the work because it s not there 
len ratingone I spend hours doing hw Turing it in just so when I go back it shows nothing 
len ratingone Disappointed with this app and word and PowerPoint 
len ratingone Kick rocks 
len ratingone no one likes online school
len ratingone  This app doesn t give the needed tools to perform the duties I have to complete 
len ratingfive Great way for way to communicate and get a quick response from team while telecommuting during this troubling times 
len ratingone As of iOS the app disconnects from the on goin meeting when the iPhone is locked 
len ratingone GHARBAGE 
len ratingone It s not good I do not get anything
len ratingone  No
len ratingfive I never seen befor something like that 
len ratingfive It s terrific 
len ratingfour  would be useful if bookmarked messages had the option of appearing in a frame next to conversation similar to how Slack treats starred messages 
len ratingtwo The app works great except that pressing the iPhone side button exits the meeting 
len ratingtwo That s a dumb design 
len ratingone I don t have a printer at my house so I can t print and do the work and it won t let me click on the answer or anything
len ratingone P e n i s
len ratingfive I m generally very happy with MS Teamsn and it siOS app
len ratingone  Duh
len ratingone horrible 
len ratingone putrid 
len ratingone Let s just say whatever Microsoft thinks they re doing isn t working out 
len ratingone  I HATE ONLINE SCHOOL SO MUCH 
len ratingone Then I saw something that said if an app gets too many star reviews teachers won t use it so I gave it one star 
len ratingone It s a good app though 
len ratingone Sorry Microsoft
len ratingfive Teams is a great way to do projects large and small 
len ratingfive It s been a godsend since the Stay at Home order 
len ratingfive Microsoft hit a homerun with this program 
len ratingtwo Overall it s a pretty great app 
len ratingtwo I had to download it for school and for about the first week it worked great 
len ratingtwo I could chat with friends turn my work in after hour of trying to figure out how to do that and even call and FaceTime friends and teachers 
len ratingtwo But about weeks into using this app the bugs started happening 
len ratingtwo I can t call any people anymore without the app just giving out and kicking me back to home screen or doing the same when I try to turn into assignments 
len ratingtwo Very disappointed now I have to email my teachers instead of being able to properly turn it in which causes much more stress for them too 
len ratingtwo My school has students 
len ratingtwo I really love the idea of the app but the glitches have almost taken over the app for me and makes it stressful to complete school work 
len ratingtwo Also I feel as if the app should have a guide when you first download the app too 
len ratingtwo When I downloaded it the app was very confusing and I didn t know where everything was and it took me almost an hour to find my way into assignments and turning them in 
len ratingtwo It was like being in a maze 
len ratingtwo I honestly hope this app can improve 
len ratingtwo COVID will probably not end anytime soon and I will be stuck using this app for at least a year 
len ratingtwo I don t hate this app but I think there are some large improvements that need to be made so please take this as constructive criticism 
len ratingone The new version blacks out my screen when on a call 
len ratingone Flickers on and off slowly 
len ratingone Can t do anything else including see who s on the call 
len ratingone Its a because we have to do online classes during the outbreak
len ratingfive With of our office now working remotely this app is tremendous for fast easy communication 
len ratingfive The call quality smashed cell phone reception amp the ability to share computer screens amp video conferencing blows away Zoom amp GoTo Meeting 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone its just really bad
len ratingone  Horrible app that is pretty much comparable to a trash can pls delete this app it is just hard to even look at it
len ratingone This doesn t work half the time 
len ratingone Don t know if it s because I m on IOS but this for digital learning is possibly the worst app to do it on 
len ratingfive I use this app for school work and it works amazing 
len ratingfive No problems with the app but it is a good app
len ratingfive Our team meetings are safe and up to date Information provided 
len ratingfive We can do our meetings from any place 
len ratingfive We have updated schedules treatment plans and our team contacts available in one place 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone I use my school work here I hate it I hope people keep rating it star so we can fake it down
len ratingfive It s organizes calendars and meetings in a good way 
len ratingone  This app is sooo bad I wish I can take it out the phone an light it on fire and then spit on it our teachers give us a load tone of work for no reason one of my teachers gave me assignments in one day I don t kno who she thinks is doin that but it ain t gon be me another one of my teachers gave us two assignments in one day and they were both notes how do you expect us to study notes in a couple of days and then ace both quizzes it s ridiculous and we also have to Study for other stuff like what in the world do you think this is I am not the one I have Crap ton of work like a lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot of work to make up for just cuz I missed a week thats utterly ridiculous the point is I hate this app so much and I wish it can be taken down thankyou for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
len ratingone  Trash
len ratingfive  As a student I have seen many applications for distance learning but teams is by far my favorite 
len ratingfive I use teams on my laptop and on my I pad making it accessible almost everywhere 
len ratingfive It s extremely productive and it allows my teachers to assign homework and make a schedule 
len ratingfive I am very fond of this app and I hope they keep up the work
len ratingone  So since me and everyone else is in quarantine I have to do online school and it doesn t let me sign into my account using the correct school email 
len ratingone I know I m not going crazy because I use to use this at school and now at the most important time in the year it finally doesn t want me to do anything pertaining to work for my school that I need to turn in 
len ratingone I would be great to find out what my issue is if a worker for this place can tell me what going on 
len ratingone Thank you
len ratingone Bad really bad
len ratingone  yup
len ratingone School
len ratingtwo  I cannot change my profile picture anymore and it glitches so much but it s kinda good
len ratingfive Lavarse las manos 
len ratingfive No tocar a las personas 
len ratingfive No tocarse la cara 
len ratingfive Ech rse gel 
len ratingfive Est r lejos de las personas 
len ratingone  I don t like online school
len ratingone Uses an absurd amount of battery compared to other chat apps slack line wechat 
len ratingone Would uninstall immediately if not required for work 
len ratingone Will be pushing to switch back to slack 
len ratingone I get too many assignments and it isn t good for my mental health
len ratingone  stream so what
len ratingone It s hard to do workk
len ratingfour Wish there was an easy delete for chat strings 
len ratingfour Restart new string same group On Calls wish I could see and choose the phone number called 
len ratingfour Wish could call the office phone in cases where no pc cam mic capability exists What is the max number of calls can be in a conference 
len ratingone  The App Is Stupid
len ratingfour Time lag in large groups and the capacity for holding groups of greater than for a recent all hands meeting is apparently an issue 
len ratingfour Directly into the teams invite instead of toggling between outlook and teams
len ratingone I do not like it I hate work
len ratingone  THIS APP
len ratingone  Complete Trash
len ratingone Teams should not be used for school it is hard to check in because in the channels it s says not able to post and also it says go to attendance channels there isn t any for any of my classes it don t make since if parents decide if students pass there s no point of online school next year we should just do a review over everything 
len ratingfive This has been a very useful platform overall 
len ratingfive Working from home and interacting with co workers has been simplified using this app platform 
len ratingfive Also uploading sharing and storing documents is simple on a computer or tablet which is another huge plus I do have one issue that I hope Microsoft will update or fix 
len ratingfive When presenting as a single presenter there is no way to pin myself unless I am sharing a ppt or other document 
len ratingfive If I want my audience to see me or my environment there no way to pin myself 
len ratingfive I hope I am wrong and there is some workaround 
len ratingone Dont like how it works
len ratingone this app is the reason im doing school still so i dont like it 
len ratingfive Using teams thanks to COVID and I love it 
len ratingfive Will definitely continue to use once we return to normal operations 
len ratingfive Very user friendly using voice over 
len ratingfour I would like an easier way to tag people
len ratingfive Our business using teams for the first time it s been very helpful and easy to learn 
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingone it needs to be taken down
len ratingfive  Allah kare tum logo ka server he karab ho jaye hamri khushian barabad kar de han
len ratingone MS teams is extremely slow and buggy 
len ratingone I have to wait for secs minute for something to load completely 
len ratingone I d rather use Schoology than this 
len ratingone The only good part about MS teams is that you can undo a turn in 
len ratingone My son has been getting messages from one of your workers and it was sexual and bad don t get this app it has no point at all
len ratingone  I do not like this app because you can even do anything on here and with j try it does not work I would get it a zero but I can t
len ratingone School
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingfour Love the app just annoying having to also download Microsoft office apps to access files
len ratingone  I ve seen a blog posting dating back to early March promising critically requested updates to teams yet at a critical time with more users than could ever be expected none of these gaps are being addressed 
len ratingone Please at a bare minimum roll out background blur and the ability to see more than team member videos 
len ratingone  I don t see an button on the bottom of my screen 
len ratingone So how am i supposed to join meetings
len ratingone Terrible
len ratingone  Flat out garbage
len ratingone  this app crashes
len ratingfive As my departments go to IT support Teams is easy to use easy to walk people through easy to troubleshoot and I think the phone app works better than the desktop app for large meetings 
len ratingthree Would like more video options to view all participants versus only at a time 
len ratingfive Love always works great for me 
len ratingfive ESP on the go 
len ratingone The app barely works for me every time I use it it closes
len ratingone It is very poor app
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingone this app is doo doo 
len ratingone All I get is work and the quality is a 
len ratingtwo I hate the fact that you cannot delete messages on here 
len ratingtwo I have too much clutter in my chat and seem to accidentally I m the wrong person when trying to respond because there are too many chats open 
len ratingtwo This is NOT a good feature at all 
len ratingtwo I wish we went back to Skype for Business because it was always so much cleaner and easier to use 
len ratingtwo Just not a good app for me 
len ratingone Not good
len ratingthree I think I miss notifications sometimes 
len ratingthree When I schedule a meeting it doesn t notify my pairs in the company and doesn t sync my google calendar
len ratingone  It s so confusing to use
len ratingone  More people should spam star to save students from doing this bs
len ratingtwo Disappointed with the app especially when you have used the PC 
len ratingtwo Why are the functionalities not there like white board showing videos during a meeting etc 
len ratingone  QUALITY VOLUME MIC ITS ALL JUST TRASH
len ratingone I hate it so much let me sleep
len ratingone I want it to get taken down
len ratingone Runs your battery
len ratingone Teachers assign too much homework and it s frustrating
len ratingone So bad NO ONE WANTS TK DO WORK 
len ratingone Bzndbne
len ratingone It can t be put into words how unusable and confusing this app is 
len ratingone  It doesn t let me log in
len ratingone This app lets students mute the teacher and people know how to hack people and it s star
len ratingone  I have been trying to get on a cal for hours and haven t been able to 
len ratingone This platform is horrible go use FaceTime ughhhhhh
len ratingone This app actually is confusing as hell no teachers know how to use it and my stress from this app makes me want to punch a wall 
len ratingone  That s all it is
len ratingone a keep getting Messages from people i don t know
len ratingone  It s bad
len ratingone This app is very glitchy during calls 
len ratingone Not just for me but many people in my class 
len ratingone Also it wastes a lot of battery 
len ratingfive  Yes
len ratingone No more school
len ratingfive It s been a lot stable then Skype 
len ratingfive Over all easy to use then SKYPE with more features for you Business needs
len ratingone it s super confusing unmanageable and glitchy 
len ratingone never really works properly 
len ratingone Half my teachers don t know how to use it and it s super laggy fix your app
len ratingfive This app is best in class
len ratingone Lol
len ratingfour Hello I love this app as it helps me to learn during Covid but there is only one problem 
len ratingfour Today I needed to talk to my teacher about the work but I realized that the chat box isn t there anymore 
len ratingfour  I hope you could put the chat box back Overall everything is AMAZING hope you can fix this problem 
len ratingtwo  but then moving way Microsoft is
len ratingone terrible app never using agai
len ratingone Wak
len ratingone The app is very bad
len ratingone  I don t like how it works
len ratingone  So bad of an app to use 
len ratingone It s repulsing 
len ratingone  So recently we upgraded our internet so we can have a strong connection throughout the house 
len ratingone I can sit anywhere in the house and this app won t load a single thing 
len ratingone Not impressed Microsoft 
len ratingone NEEDS MORE WORK 
len ratingone si
len ratingone As students we are not expected to own the latest tech release devices 
len ratingone So please make it available on older devices such as iPad 
len ratingfour  I did homework and it is the wrong and I can t delete it can you fix it and put delete option 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingtwo Can t initiate a channel Team meeting like you can in the paid version of Slack 
len ratingtwo Can t even make a call within the app without allowing it to access your contacts 
len ratingtwo It gets my stars for the things it matches up with Slack like chat and threads but those weren t as intuitive to setup as it was in Slack 
len ratingtwo My corporation defaulted to this over Slack MissSlack
len ratingfive Microsoft did an amazing job with Teams and the app makes it even easier to stay connect to the office especially in today s day of age 
len ratingfive Highly recommend this tool for anyone remote working or running an organization business 
len ratingone The students who are doing Microsoft Teams have a very less chance of learning anything when they can cheat on everything and the work is too much especially when it s due the next day 
len ratingone That shouldn t be an option for they should have one assignment for one then another for the next 
len ratingone Also there is no video or pdf to show you how to move around the app 
len ratingone The app is a pain to get logged into the assignments can t be downloaded on some phones 
len ratingone Also the chat feature doesn t work on phone so its very annoying and hard to participate in classes while using the app 
len ratingone  Keep Me Up All Day Because My Teacher Won t Stop Sending me stuff I m exhausted and tired I feel like I m bout to blow any day know and give your children Depression and anxiety 
len ratingone I hate online school work UGH
len ratingone  no
len ratingone It doesn t work at all and the other ones like this don t work delete them all 
len ratingone my child uses this for online work but it never works 
len ratingone And her classmates never works so they are failing because of this app 
len ratingone Stress fr
len ratingtwo  Can t initiate a channel Team meeting like you can in the paid version of Slack 
len ratingtwo It gets my stars for the things it matches up with Slack like chat and threads but those weren t as intuitive to setup as it was in Slack 
len ratingtwo My corporation defaulted to this over Slack MissSlack
len ratingfour Fairly simple to use 
len ratingfour Could have a private option to chat with one person in a group mtg 
len ratingfour Sometimes hard to toggle between shared screen and chat on the app
len ratingfive Great interface easy to use not buggy solid 
len ratingone  No
len ratingone But I have been having a lot of problems
len ratingone When I installed to join online class I didn t have any issue 
len ratingone I join the online class 
len ratingone but today I kept getting error something went wrong 
len ratingone I created outlook account I didn t have any issue to open the Microsoft Teams 
len ratingone When I try to use with my gmail account Keep getting error Something went wrong 
len ratingone I try to communicate my online class editor he is saying after lesson they can accept 
len ratingone I missed my online class today 
len ratingfive  Especially during this work away from office period 
len ratingone Trash 
len ratingone Thats the review
len ratingone Poop
len ratingfour Overall I like the app 
len ratingfour There needs to bea delete function for files in the chat 
len ratingthree  I am just starting to use teams and what I realised is that the app doe not have as many options as the browser version 
len ratingthree I only have an iPad so it would be nice to have a whiteboard option in the iOS app this wasn t available in the meetings I had the extended option to choose which screens I wanted to share would be nice as well 
len ratingthree I find it strange that I have to share my entire screen when I am moving from one app to another 
len ratingthree It would also be nice to be able to upload powerpoints and files from other file managers local file manager on iPads and not just one drive 
len ratingthree Pretty much the full functions of the website as the organiser would be appreciated 
len ratingthree With the website version on an iPad you are only allowed a preview and can t make calls from there for a lot of things they defer you to the app that does not allow some of the actions so you still miss out 
len ratingone  This app is so buggy and terrible everything takes so long to pop up and most links don t work
len ratingone This app is trash and don t use it
len ratingfive Can you please provide the ability for a participant to see all others at the same time 
len ratingfive That would be a fantastic addition to this beautiful app 
len ratingfive I have been using it 
len ratingfive No issues at all 
len ratingfive This App is Awesome 
len ratingone  This app is the one that should be getting bashed and not google classroom because on Microsoft teams it should allow you to look at a calendar that shows which days your assignments are due 
len ratingone Also on this app there are always glitches saying something is wrong 
len ratingone This app is terrible it does not work efficiently on any device I have 
len ratingone Please remove this app
len ratingone It just bad
len ratingone This app glitches wayyyy too much and I have can almost never make it run on my computer without waiting an entire lightyear 
len ratingone Also when I m on teams live classes my phone screen will blink to a black screen it s rlly annoying 
len ratingone as a student this app is really confusing especially when teachers delete assignments and stuff and i don t like how on video calls you can only see screens
len ratingone i don t like school 
len ratingone After the last update when I am in my car connected to car play it locks it up and drops my call and shuts down my gps directions 
len ratingone This is not safe to use while you are on the road 
len ratingfive The Teams app makes it very easy to stay connected 
len ratingone I was sent an invite for a Cub Scout free account setup 
len ratingone When I enter my gmail account to sign up it s recognizing it as a school account and trying to make me sign up for the education account
len ratingone The meeting are horrible
len ratingfour We need more than people on video and a way to markup a drawing that is on the screen 
len ratingthree New user hear 
len ratingthree Noticing that some of the functionality in Excel spreadsheets cell selection formatting is not available within Teams 
len ratingthree Want to use this app because it sounds cool but so far feel like I have to settle for less than 
len ratingfour Perfect way to reach out to your team and other co workers 
len ratingone Very very bad I can t explain
len ratingone  Me dan m s ganas de SuiCiDarMe grAsIaS 
len ratingfive This app has help my team communicate in and out of the office 
len ratingone It is bad cuz there is no chat and calls
len ratingfive Excelent app versatile and fast love it 
len ratingone It s terrible and needs to be taken down 
len ratingone It should never be used again
len ratingfive Everything is fine but only one problem found 
len ratingfive when share my screen 
len ratingfive View comes late
len ratingone It s really glitchy and breaks out all the time and you can only see screens at a time need much improvement and privet messages aren t privet so don t try and chat bad stuff
len ratingfive  this app is better than zoom zoom has only mins and ms teams has infinite this is so good 
len ratingfive Rate stars
len ratingone Making kids do so much work in such a hard time
len ratingone School 
len ratingone I use it for work 
len ratingone Which is great 
len ratingone But because I use it for work Microsoft won t let me use it with my personal account as well 
len ratingone So that s a big fail for me 
len ratingone I need an all in one solution 
len ratingone This app literally makes me join classes even when I don t want to even if the app is just running in the background 
len ratingone I m really worried abt my privacy and I don t wannabe embarrassed in front of my class 
len ratingone If I had the option to give it stars I would 
len ratingone This app is so bad and horrible that I can t even explain i wish I can give it a no star 
len ratingone It makes me join my classes without me knowing so I could go to the toilet and I m afraid my whole class would see 
len ratingone I HATE THE APP CAUSE ITS AN INVASION OF MY PRIVACY
len ratingfour Could be better
len ratingone I have no problem with the app but i don t lie school so I m trying to get it taken off the store sorry bill
len ratingfive This app makes a seamless transition between the Teams desktop version and mobile app a breeze 
len ratingfive I love sending pictures from my phone yo chats 
len ratingfive It adds a whole new dimension to working
len ratingone Bruh I don t wanna do work
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft 
len ratingfive Always been a fan despite Windows XP and 
len ratingfive Great to see you reinvent yourself again in a more populist and grassroots spirit reminds of early years 
len ratingfive This is the next step to the future god speed 
len ratingfive New to Teams 
len ratingfive Love the way it is integrated with the Microsoft applications 
len ratingfive File sharing rd party app integration makes it a comprehensive tool to conduct business 
len ratingfive Going to replace brick and mortar offices
len ratingone I hate this corona
len ratingfour I started using teams when our office closed due to COVID in an effort to maintain connectivity 
len ratingfour Our team quickly adapted to this platform 
len ratingfour In most respects the software meets or exceeds my expectations after weeks of use 
len ratingfour Our team would appreciate improving the video conferencing feature to see more participants and being able to track edits on documents editing within a team or channel interface 
len ratingfour I understand MS is working on the former 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone It s a horrible
len ratingone This is the worst app ever it has really bad quality do NOT get this app it is a waste of your time
len ratingtwo its not bad but it aint great either
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive It s perfect for school and business consider the conditions that we are in right now 
len ratingfive You can chat do assignments make files and do much more 
len ratingfive There is only one thing that I think we can improve and that s the lagging 
len ratingfive Every few hours there is some kind of bug on the device 
len ratingfive Other than that this is the ideal app for business and school 
len ratingfive I ve come to enjoy using Teams for business meetings 
len ratingfive Incredibly powerful for remote work while traveling 
len ratingfive Only issue right now is notifications on my mobile while messaging from the pc interface 
len ratingthree Despite the name you can t send a meeting invite to a distribution list of people only one at a time 
len ratingone it s very confusing when teachers send out assignments
len ratingone Horrible app
len ratingfive Simple to use
len ratingfive  By far the best productivity app 
len ratingfive Team and project management made easy 
len ratingfive It is great for visually managing most aspect of personal and work items 
len ratingone The website when you use the notebook it deletes data and and when you type it deletes all the data you type 
len ratingone That is why nobody can do work on it 
len ratingfive Awesome collaboration tool 
len ratingfive Really helpful in the current conditions where most of is are Teleworking
len ratingthree Have lots of little glitches but appears to be promising
len ratingfive Excellent

len ratingfive It s hot
len ratingthree Love MS Teams on my computer but the app is pretty limited 
len ratingthree I can t even get to messages 
len ratingone Uses all my storage
len ratingthree Too difficult to find mute unmute button when on a call 
len ratingone No I do not like
len ratingfive Very strong reliable application
len ratingfive Telefondan gruplar n i ine daha rahat girmeyi ve i indeki dosyalara kolayca bakabilmeyi isterim
len ratingone This app froze on its launch screen and then wouldn t allow me to control my phone at all 
len ratingone Didn t allow me to get back to my home screen switch to other apps close the app nothing 
len ratingone Tried using my control center with notifications from other apps to open other apps 
len ratingone Didn t work 
len ratingone Then my phone while still frozen on this apps launch screen sent out emergency notifications and called 
len ratingone Fantastic 
len ratingone Coming off my phone immediately 
len ratingone I could see none of this happening because all i could see was the Microsoft Teams launch screen 
len ratingone So stupid 
len ratingone Idc how much of a convenience it was to use for work not worth the stress it just caused 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I receive information on this app before I get it on my work computer 
len ratingfive Way to go MS 
len ratingone Too much work teacher feel like just because we home we not doing nothing and we very much are
len ratingone Forced to use Teams because of the quarantine and school being canceled 
len ratingone My child is a whiz with the iPad but not familiar with an actual laptop so I thought it would be easiest for her to do her homework with the App 
len ratingone Boy was I wrong 
len ratingone The app is confusing and omits half of the features MS teams offers on a PC 
len ratingone If you have to use it for school like we do I hope you have a PC that you can use as well 
len ratingone Super disappointed and feel sorry for families that only have iPads but no laptops 
len ratingfive Excellent for large staff meetings and staying organized 
len ratingfive Makes working from home one of the most important innovations in a long time 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingone Very laggy school calls I could barely understand what my teacher was saying 
len ratingone Helps teachers to give us hw
len ratingone I get really irritated when i get on ms teams 
len ratingone I m a student in high school and due to the circumstances we re under they have moved us to learn online 
len ratingone All of my teachers use teams so we turn in all of our work in Microsoft Teams 
len ratingone It moves really slow as i m typing this i ve been trying to turn in my work for an hour now and every time it tells me something like sorry we re unable to connect reconnecting 
len ratingone I wish I had a little patient but i don t because this happens everyday when I get on it 
len ratingone Some of us are gonna have online classes on this app 
len ratingone i hate it
len ratingfour Would like to see more than video feeds at one time 
len ratingfour Overall very good 
len ratingone Always leaving me home work 
len ratingone Please take it off it very annoying and bad
len ratingone this app is horrible 
len ratingone absolutely atrocious it needs to be taken away from the app store admittedly 
len ratingfour This is a big problem that I cannot delete chat messages for privacy reasons 
len ratingfour Example remove all chat from my visibility of chats with Alex 
len ratingfive It helps me and my organization to find a good flow to work and achieve our goals 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingone Get this trash outta here 
len ratingone I got to level and then the app crashed and now I can t get back to where I was because my progress didn t save 
len ratingone This deserves to be taken down 
len ratingone I would put stars if you could
len ratingthree I am a student and I needed to download this app for school but the connection is terrible just terrible 
len ratingthree I downloaded this app on my phone because the one on my surface keeps glitching and the chat never worked for me so I never knew what was happening in class and my camera doesn t work at all on my surface but when we tried to go fix it it still wouldn t work 
len ratingthree Even the one on my phone still glitches a lot but it is the best I have 
len ratingone  There are many issues and the app usually has trouble loading up assignments
len ratingone  please get removed i hate this so much it doesn t even workekrkdodmkd
len ratingone  doesn t work
len ratingone This app wasn t the best to use on your phone because it may give you notifications but it won t when there is a meeting
len ratingone Literally so many issues with this app on mobile and desktop 
len ratingone If you love super laggy messaging that will randomly send posts before you finish typing and without even hitting enter this app is right for you 
len ratingone Trash 
len ratingone ALWAYS GLITCHES
len ratingfive Love connecting through team app
len ratingfive The product works great 
len ratingfive It has a lot of great features that I find incredibly useful during my day to day tasks 
len ratingfive Thank you for creating this software and app 
len ratingfive It has made conducting and participating in meetings while working from home a BREEZE 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Amazing tool To work remotely
len ratingfour Prefer to be able to see more then participants 
len ratingthree So overall I love Teams 
len ratingthree It s a great app and I use it a lot now for school because of COVID 
len ratingthree But there are some changes that need to be made and I have one specific in mind 
len ratingthree I don t know if it s just me but I mainly use teams on my iPad and it s really frustrating when I can t upload into folders so I have to do this whole transition process from my iPad to my Computer just to get it to upload 
len ratingthree Once again I m not sure if this is a personal problem but I m guessing not because my friends and classmates have the same issue with the mobile version 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingthree My phone locks up while on a call if I don t keep the phone on 
len ratingthree The only thing I am able to do then is call or wait for my phone to die 
len ratingtwo Its okay but I would have liked to used the iPad to present PowerPoint presentations and use the Whiteboard function in Meetings Microsoft please add the full user experience to the iPad not the very limited iPhone interface
len ratingtwo Not adapted for online learning unintuitive at times
len ratingfive I love the program 
len ratingfive It is easy to use and very efficient 
len ratingfour Lots of useful capabilities 
len ratingfour The only reason I didn t give stars is the lack of ability to view more than participants at a time in the video conference feature 
len ratingfive Running team meetings with people and not hitting even glitch 
len ratingfive Perfection 
len ratingtwo My options are to not hear anything or to blow out my eardrums and sue microsoft for the damages 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone Really really really bad do not recommend on using
len ratingfour Would be five stars if it had annotation 
len ratingfour Sometimes the connection is a little bad but it s usually good 
len ratingtwo  it s a good app for the past lessons i ve been doing but my device hasn t been letting me join any 
len ratingtwo i ve been getting assignments and i do them but the lessons i can t join 
len ratingfour Would you consider a watch app 
len ratingthree As we are transitioning to remote learning due to the recent pandemic I have witnessed classmates trolling each other by kicking each other out of the call 
len ratingthree This is pretty much a big problem 
len ratingthree I understand that kicking people out should be an option but at least show who s kicking their classmates out 
len ratingthree Other than that video qualities needs to be fixed 
len ratingone It has been increasingly stressful for me to get my work done when I m trying to type in a document and I am CLEARLY typing in the document but the words either don t show up at all or it doesn t save even though office teams word are supposed to auto save 
len ratingone Such utter trash and complete hatred much lag and loss of my work for lack of save features
len ratingone I rated it a zero bc it glitches
len ratingone Sometimes the sound is crackly
len ratingone Wouldn t let me in the chat Just go use zoom
len ratingone It bad kid
len ratingfive Nothing to complain 
len ratingfive Works like a charm 
len ratingfive So thankful for Teams as I have to work remotely 
len ratingfive It s user friendly and you can do so much with it 
len ratingfive  New to Teams 
len ratingfive Love the way it is integrated with the Microsoft applications 
len ratingfive File sharing rd party app integration makes it a comprehensive tool to conduct business 
len ratingfive Going to replace brick and mortar offices
len ratingfive It s hard to imagine working from home without Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive It is the host of my calls chat files notes an collaboration meetings 
len ratingone It wouldn t let me sign in 
len ratingone Uhh
len ratingfive Love speaking with everyone
len ratingone Rate this a Star so I could get taken down and we won t have to do online school anymore
len ratingone Worst app ever
len ratingone This app is the worst you don t understand 
len ratingone When I tried to start a meeting it crashed 
len ratingone I believe that this app needs a lot of work 
len ratingone That it shouldn t be rated so high 
len ratingone It I could give stars I would 
len ratingone very confusing to use
len ratingone Get this app to star
len ratingfive For those who are staying at home highly recommend this for you
len ratingfour Teams could do better with video 
len ratingfour However overall it s amazing for team communication collaboration and resource charting 
len ratingfive Change is never fun for me 
len ratingfive However now Teams is super easy to use 
len ratingfive My only complaint is that you can t switch the camera view 
len ratingfive You can only see yourself 
len ratingfive Maybe there is a function on there where you can but I have not found it 
len ratingthree Feel it s missing more chat versatility
len ratingone  Ahhhh
len ratingone  Our plan will accomplish soon 
len ratingfive I wanted this for our business for many years 
len ratingfive It is better than text WhatsApp and email 
len ratingfive I highly recommend 
len ratingtwo  Do you have a Microsoft Teams app for iPad with iOS 
len ratingtwo If not please consider creating one 
len ratingtwo There are students across the nation with older iPads who need a Teams app 
len ratingone i just don t wanna do my school work lol
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfour Would like to see everyone on the call on the screen not just people
len ratingone i had so manny difficulties with this app it s not even funny 
len ratingone i try to get in contact with my professors and it doesn t even work 
len ratingone one star until improvements are made
len ratingone Ahhhhhhh
len ratingone  this app is bad voices glitch and echos every time and it s delayed
len ratingone I looked at the participants and when I wanted to go back to the main screen there is no option to do so 
len ratingone I tried swiping in all directions but nothing changed 
len ratingone Only thing I could do was click on the participants 
len ratingfour The teams app has made it easy to stay connect to my group 
len ratingone TikTok
len ratingfive I like this app Works great on the phone 
len ratingfive I do have one complaint about how it works on the computer 
len ratingfive When I need to drag it from one screen to the other I find it hard to grab the top and drag it to the other screen 
len ratingfive This annoys me 
len ratingone Problems after problems just trying to setup 
len ratingone Stuck in a continuous loop of trying to make me load the app which is already loaded 
len ratingone Tried on desktop Mac and can t reach anyone 
len ratingone Everyone I sent invites too can t get it working 
len ratingone What a disaster for trying to bring people family work etc together with so many people having to jump through hoops to figure it out 
len ratingtwo I can t use my headphones with this app 
len ratingtwo For some reason whenever I use my headphones the volume is incredibly loud and unbearable 
len ratingtwo I put it at the lowest possible volume and it hurts my ears 
len ratingtwo Interestingly enough when I let the sound come through my phone the volume is quiet and I often have to hold my phone up to my ear 
len ratingtwo Other than that the app works fine
len ratingone  Ur killing these kids minds so for the sake of our generation let us be better than y all and not do the same exact thing y all did cause we can elevate let us
len ratingfive Finally a solution that actually works with the majority of business applications that is used on a day to day basis 
len ratingfive Long time overdue 
len ratingfive Looking to improve productivity big time 
len ratingone  It won t even let me attach my work
len ratingfour Almost better than zoom 
len ratingfour Although try to make it easier setting up 
len ratingone This app is just horrible trying to turn in work is such a pain and everything takes so long to load 
len ratingone And none of the recorded videos even work when trying to play them back if you missed a class 
len ratingone Whatever you do don t get this app 
len ratingone Every time I try to sign into this app a note always shows up saying Sign In Error 
len ratingone Please try again well I keep trying and trying but it never lets me sign in 
len ratingone And it s a HUGE pain to set up a new account on the app because it s also doing the same thing on that part as well 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfour Basically with everything going on my school uses this to talk to all of our teachers 
len ratingfour The microphone on my computer doesn t work so I tried to download the app 
len ratingfour The first time I downloaded it I couldn t log in because it kept taking me to the website and then telling me to download the app and repeating the same process over and over so I deleted it 
len ratingfour Now that I re downloaded it I was able to click my email and it signed me in with no issues 
len ratingfour It was a bit frustrating that I had to delete it and didn t think to download it again but overall this will be very helpful for me 
len ratingfour I generally finding this app extremely useful especially in our current remote work environment 
len ratingfour Our in office fast message system doesn t work well with VPN so having the Chat feature is great 
len ratingfour I will say that the Teams video conferencing is not yet as good as the others I am most familiar with Skype for Business and Zoom 
len ratingfour I hope that Microsoft will continue to improve it especially as it is my understanding that they intend to remove Skype for Business from Office 
len ratingfour From time to time when I get calls there is a high pitch ringtone that makes me throw my earplugs and its way to annoying hopefully you see this and fix it bacause its just damages my ears
len ratingfour This is a great app and works wonderfully on my phone 
len ratingfour We also have it on our chrome books for work and it doesn t work as well there 
len ratingfour Audio always seems to be an issue 
len ratingfour We are still working through that issue though bc it seems to be the only one we have run into 
len ratingfour Other than that we love it 
len ratingone I ve tried with two emails my personal and my school account and could not successfully create an account with Teams 
len ratingone It kept telling me that I needed authorization or that I am not signed up yet 
len ratingone After hours of troubleshooting I was able to make it work out with my personal email 
len ratingone I received a code to join a Team meeting and when I tried to punch it in it kept telling me that something went wrong 
len ratingone On the phone app it allowed me to type in a code but on the computer app there wasn t even an option to join with a code 
len ratingone Horrible app 
len ratingone There s better 
len ratingfive This tool is much needed 
len ratingfive I found it to be intuitive and easy to use 
len ratingfive I have used it every day since I gained access 
len ratingfive I highly recommend we have this as a NIWC tool for our teams to use 
len ratingone It very laggy and in organized I don t like it because it is very bad quality
len ratingfive The most intuitive platform for chats meetings documents etc that I have used 
len ratingone  Well made I just don t want school at home
len ratingone  Ruining students lives
len ratingone Why Does the Teams have a need account 
len ratingfour Thumbs up
len ratingone Teribke
len ratingfour Good tool for working collaboratively but it needs a common shared team calendar 
len ratingfive MS Teams has proven to be much more useful and reliable than tools like Skype and Zoom 
len ratingfive I haven t really encountered any limitations yet which are easy to encounter in the other products 
len ratingfive Not to mention Zoom is likely made in China so beware of entering any IP in Zoom 
len ratingfive Anyway Teams is awesome and I highly recommend it 
len ratingone This stupid app won t let me create an account
len ratingone  i don t like work during break
len ratingone bad
len ratingfour Generally a great app but it s lots of little things that spoil the user experience 
len ratingfour Add contact does not make the text field active so you have to reach for the mouse again 
len ratingfour Annoying 
len ratingfour Edit is right next to delete 
len ratingfour I use edit a lot 
len ratingfour Delete is an immediate action 
len ratingfour Buttons are small 
len ratingfour Text is small and no way to increase size by a point or two 
len ratingfour Speech bubbles are a waste of space 
len ratingfour The feeling I have when using most MS products is frustration 
len ratingfour It s a shame 
len ratingfour It all adds up to typical MS design 
len ratingfour They need to spend more time on UX 
len ratingfour It takes time to get right but MS product typically have a lot of low hanging fruit in this area that if they tackled it would make a world of difference 
len ratingfour I came from Slack and when I first started using teams it struck me how unintuitive the UI was 
len ratingfour Common important features hidden away 
len ratingfour Felt like Windows all over again 
len ratingfour Same designer perhaps 
len ratingfour Crashes often for no reason
len ratingfive Finally an app that exceeds expectations 
len ratingone Bad app
len ratingone I ve been using this app for a while now and it s just difficult to get around and glitches quite a bit overall bad experience Mainly cause this is for school purposes 
len ratingone  Dddds
len ratingone Everytime I try to make a FaceTime call it goes to Microsoft teams
len ratingone As a teacher this app is very unprofessional 
len ratingone I don t have my students use this app anymore because it doesn t allow use a lot of accessories 
len ratingone For example it doesn t protect the student s privacy when they are having their own personal conversations 
len ratingone Also my students have had problems with turning in assignments 
len ratingone It takes them very long to send pictures of their work to me because the application is so slow 
len ratingone I have also received complaints about the turning in of assignments 
len ratingone It often glitches and my students have to redo the work they already did 
len ratingone If the algorithm can get fixed the app might actually work fine and not be a waste of time 
len ratingone  This app is super glitchy and inaccurate I do not have my students use this because the app grades incorrectly 
len ratingone  it s so glitchy when i want to type lags so bad it s worse than google classroom please delete it because then you d be doing students a favor 
len ratingone i switch out of teams and then copy and paste because it doesn t let me type a lot it s so stupid 
len ratingone just delete this rn 
len ratingone I can t even download it on my phone
len ratingone  Fhftjgtt
len ratingone It s a bad app
len ratingfive Surprisingly good and stable 
len ratingfour With Skype it didn t use to show the IMs unless the app was opened 
len ratingfour With MS teams you get a notification when an IM comes in 
len ratingfour Still learning features but conference calls are not intuitive to start 
len ratingfour Not sure yet how to 
len ratingfour I can dial another tel but not sure how to conferencing it in with existing 
len ratingfive Wish it had the capability to run more the videos at a time
len ratingfour I am more impressed as I dig in 
len ratingfour They made integration with Outlook and Groups and Sharepoint easier 
len ratingfour That s a relief 
len ratingfour Still a bit hard to determine how to reduce clutter and I m not sure what the general tab value is if it s all about Channels 
len ratingfour Like I wish General was a list of all the activity like Slack in all Channels but it s not or I can t figure out how 
len ratingfour So feels like ppl have to dive into each Channel to see things 
len ratingfive Microsoft teams es una herramienta muy vers til y de f cil manejo es una excelente utilidad que nos permite la administraci n remota de nuestros activos tecnol gicos 
len ratingfive Es reliable y con una interface de usuario muy completa que te permite visualizar cada uno de los espectros operacionales ha trav s de un manejo remoto y efectivo 
len ratingfive Great alp
len ratingfive TEAMS helped California County Workers
len ratingfour If it had virtual backgrounds like Zoom for meetings it would be awesome 
len ratingone It glitches too much and I haven t been able you learn it doesn t teach me anything
len ratingfive Soo much better than Skype
len ratingone the quality of the calls is so bad 
len ratingone and it lags all the time 
len ratingone  The app never works and always makes me leave classes and also it has made school harder on me
len ratingfour There s a lot to like about this app 
len ratingfour I use it more than I use email now for inter office stuff which is good 
len ratingfour My only complain is that it is sometimes hard to figure out which group I m in and what the new messages are 
len ratingfour Also it sometimes hides read stuff which takes messages out of context and I have to expand the thread to see what I m people are responding to 
len ratingfour Plenty of room for improvement there 
len ratingfive Wat better 
len ratingfive I advise everyone to use it 
len ratingfour Ag
len ratingfive Good way to keep connected
len ratingone Just doesn t work
len ratingfive My company has
len ratingone  Booty
len ratingfour People locking up dropping off the call etc 
len ratingtwo it s an okay app coming from a student i just wish there was a way you could delete assignments as you do them so you don t get confused
len ratingone  It gives me depression
len ratingone  This never works
len ratingone it can be very confusing and difficult to use 
len ratingone i highly recommend the app edmodo for learning and online communication 
len ratingone it is also hard to turn in assignments and keep in touch with your teacher 
len ratingone Me no like
len ratingfive Hi 
len ratingfive I am a student currently using teams on a regular bases now and I am running into problems of losing my work 
len ratingfive I have tried to figure out to avoid having my teams look unorganized but I can t seem to get it organized the way I would like it to be 
len ratingfive I could just be stupid but I can t figure out how to delete unnecessary tabs 
len ratingfive Also a feature that would be very helpful to add is the ability to color code activity s by using the colors of the rainbow 
len ratingfive I say using colors because most people know the order of the rainbow and it would be easier to see what needs to be done before the other things 
len ratingfive And the person who sent out the activity could label their own or the receiver could but that s just a thought 
len ratingfour This thing would work much better if there was a hands on class to show you how to use it 
len ratingfour Instead of trial by error 
len ratingone This app is waaayy too complicated Google Classroom is much simpler and much more user friendly 
len ratingone Work that teachers assign take forever to upload 
len ratingone It 
len ratingone Glitches and it s slow
len ratingfive Teams took a minute to adjust to from using five other apps to solve the same problem as long as you push through that transition it s hard to believe we used to work on so many other platforms 
len ratingfive The biggest issue was really people going into it with a closed mind because it was a Microsoft product but once they got it up in app form on their phones and laptops it s money
len ratingfive At first I resisted the change of attempting to use ANOTHER platform 
len ratingfive Platforms similar to MS Teams never really worked for us as a company 
len ratingfive Then my IT guy who is pretty awesome started showing me how it is used and how we could use it and totally convinced me that this would truly work for us 
len ratingfive I m so grateful to him and for MS Teams 
len ratingfive We actually USE IT and LOVE IT 
len ratingfive It has been instrumental in this uncertain time 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone  Meetings are hard to join as I will click the join button and it won t take me to the actual meeting but rather my own separate one 
len ratingone made me late twice 
len ratingone The app also doesn t give any notifications for posts or assignments which has caused me to miss important messages and almost get me kicked out of a program 
len ratingone Bogus 
len ratingfive This app has great versatility and is super easy to use when working remote 
len ratingfive Highly recommend
len ratingfive Very easy to see interface
len ratingtwo  I am now reverting to having to use my phone to print and upload her work 
len ratingtwo This last week couldn t get online and when I did couldn t even print the work out 
len ratingtwo Should have different schedules for the kids to logon so not everybody is online at the same time 
len ratingtwo The app should have also been put through a rigorous test 
len ratingone This app is so hard to cooperate with 
len ratingone Especially the calls with my other co workers working with this app hurts my internal organs and makes me want to destroy it immediately 
len ratingone as a student i wish this app didn t exist
len ratingone  This is the worst app I ve ever downloaded 
len ratingone I can t see the messages they send me that s why I lost my job 
len ratingone I would give stars if I could
len ratingone Bugs and issues w the app
len ratingone  Why I never used it for college and they said you needed it to
len ratingone very very bad 
len ratingone U MADE ME HAVE SCHOOL AT HOMEEEEE 
len ratingone thank u 
len ratingone  This app is garbage
len ratingfour This app has become essential at work during the pandemic 
len ratingfour This is where the future of email is headed 
len ratingone Bad app
len ratingone I don t like it bc it s not helpful
len ratingone It s trash
len ratingone  Ugh omg it s lagging and acting up I hate it there get this off the Apple store disgusting
len ratingone Logged in tried to accept an invite and all I got was the sorry try again later error message to both teams I tried to join 
len ratingone The link has worked for other people and this is my first time using this 
len ratingone Nice job microsoft 
len ratingone Baby
len ratingfive Video is not clear I also would like to have the reply to specific message to work on desktop not only phone app 
len ratingone No way
len ratingone Is wack app
len ratingone Gives me too much work to do and kills my battery
len ratingone  It is torture
len ratingone told me to kill my family

len ratingone This app for me has been an absolute nightmare to use 
len ratingone There have been countless glitches and bugs 
len ratingone It is also incredible slow and frankly should be deleted 
len ratingone Worst login experience ever I literally could not login after entering security codes and reentering my email times only to be told my business has a license for me I am my business 
len ratingone So incredibly frustrating and stupid
len ratingone This app is extremely buggy and glitchy and it is very slow and hard to do my schoolwork

len ratingfour I have tried to figure out to avoid having my teams look unorganized but I can t seem to get it organized the way I would like it to be 
len ratingfour I could just be stupid but I can t figure out how to delete unnecessary tabs

len ratingone They steal our information do not download
len ratingone It s not letting me log in and it keeps saying incorrect password when I have everything right the email and password this is the worst app
len ratingfive Excellent concept to bring omni channel experience 
len ratingfive However need to enable outlook integrated to it as soon as possible 
len ratingfour Functionally good once able to join authentication access was very difficult
len ratingone That really says it all 
len ratingone Messaging does not work if people don t get notifications 
len ratingone Normally I like Microsoft but Teams is not a good application 
len ratingone There s always technical issues 
len ratingone I ll be in a live chat meeting and it will just log me out in the middle of it 
len ratingone Also my teachers will upload work and sometimes I m unable to open it or submit my work 
len ratingone I have it because of COVID and have to use it for virtual school 
len ratingone It makes my school work take so much longer 
len ratingone IT IS A BAD APP 
len ratingone I m bored
len ratingone online classes are trash
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Wish there were more gif to use 
len ratingone  This app is so laggy I can t even listen to my teacher speaking
len ratingfive  My company recently started using Teams for all conference calls and video conferences 
len ratingfive The iPhone app has allowed me to participate in calls no matter where I am 
len ratingfive I do almost all of my video conferences from my iPad using the app 
len ratingfive I did have issues with video but that was due to bandwidth of my WIFI router and not due to the app 
len ratingfive A new router fixed the issue 
len ratingone  It s just so terrible
len ratingone I downloaded it and it gay also why y all took the private messages out that was extremely unhelpful for my classes cus my teachers say that the best way to contact them is by private but we can t anymore
len ratingfive During COVID lockdown and work from home this application help a lot to connect my team and easy communicate There are little bit improvements required to search person but rest are fine
len ratingthree if i back it up is it fat enough 
len ratingone This is a very bad app it has glitches and to add on it doesn t send your work to the teachers and there s bad word in this app and when your in the metting it takes you out very bad app 
len ratingone Is hard to use and complicated
len ratingone  I hate this app i don t recommend at all
len ratingone I m able to join as guest with sign in on Desktop and android apps 
len ratingone But for some reason iPad app is not allowing me to join without sign in 
len ratingone If you have external organization meeting you cannot join thru iPad even if you have the meeting link 
len ratingone I WANT THIS SITE GONE FOR GOOD I HATE ONLINE SCHOOL 
len ratingone This app is very slow and it never loads my assignments and whenever I m in a call I can t hear my teacher because there is some kind of glitch and I can t seem to fix it 
len ratingone Take it off the App Store
len ratingone This app ruined my life it s such a struggle and I have to wake up early for this so there is no way I am going to to back to it
len ratingone  km
len ratingone horrible
len ratingone It s very buggy and half the time it won t even load 
len ratingone I just don t wanna do school
len ratingone this is the worst app ever 
len ratingone very hard to navigate and i don t get notifications so i don t know when stuff is due
len ratingone Very slow and i can never find what i want and people keep kicking me out in the live meetings
len ratingone  This doesn t work
len ratingone Assignment
len ratingone  No
len ratingone Can t log in 
len ratingone Stuck in infinite loop 
len ratingone  Disgusting i saw the video proving that this app steals our info and uses it against us
len ratingfive Had several meetings with multiple stakeholders across different locations and companies I found MS Teams to be very reliable compared to others especially in an environment where internet connectivity is very epileptic 
len ratingfive The calls are very clear and noise reduction capability is excellent even at low data usage 
len ratingfive Many thanks for this innovative 
len ratingfive J Isuku Nigeria
len ratingfour Please integrate auto dark mode 
len ratingone unsuggested
len ratingfive I now actually prefer teams to meeting in person 
len ratingone  i hate it 
len ratingfive This mobile app has been very helpful keeping me in touch with all of our office during the stay at home order 
len ratingfive It s synced to my desktop and any laptop I m working on during the day i will continue to use it after business returns to normal 
len ratingone Works fine on the computer but at times completely unusable on the phone 
len ratingone I believe it is when someone is screen sharing when things start to completely glitch out 
len ratingone The screen will turn on and off every two seconds so that it s impossible to write in the chat or see the screen sharing 
len ratingone The screen on off problem continues on the phone even outside the app 
len ratingone Does not help to close and reopen the app 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone First of all as a student during this pandemic is extremely hard as to how to use this app using my phone 
len ratingone Checking my assignment and the deadline are as tiring to swipe down till u see your work 
len ratingone Computer are different they will give u a list of work u haven t don t in the assignment list 
len ratingone That s why I beg you please make it easy for us phone users 
len ratingtwo It d be a lot more convenient if you were able to use the video chat function on the iPad Pro and utilize the split screen function of the device 
len ratingfive I am enjoying a quick meeting at my desk 
len ratingfive No travels and it is great 
len ratingfive Great APP 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone Microsoft Teams is very limiting 
len ratingone I have yet to be in a meeting where I can see all participants faces 
len ratingone It is surprising when someone joins because it doesn t alert you other than a small bubble with initials at the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone A scroll option would be helpful and to ability to see more than people at a time 
len ratingone As a teacher who is now forced to teach online this is very limiting 
len ratingfive Integrated video chat file sharing and mgmt 
len ratingfive calendar and more 
len ratingone im tryna live my life during quarantine and yall giving us hella work like df 
len ratingfive I am having issue unable to see the status on all of my contacts colleagues 
len ratingfive Also it doesn t auto sync to me Mobile app when I am busy or away 
len ratingfive Please help ASAP
len ratingone First of all the app is constantly crashing whats tea teams 
len ratingfour Great communication tool 
len ratingfour I wish it would auto capitalize and work more like Word when I type 
len ratingtwo Even after this last update I keep getting many bugs on the iOS app 
len ratingtwo My messages often won t send or will even sometimes appear as from the person I am taking to 
len ratingtwo I wish these issues would be addressed 
len ratingfive It is really very nice application 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfive Voice quality needs improvement 
len ratingfive WhatsApp voice quality is better
len ratingfive  Thank you
len ratingone App is all confusing and the work I gotta do I ain t tranna do work at home nah g
len ratingone horrible app 
len ratingone  no
len ratingone I am a student using this and it is terrible it takes up all of my data no way how to delete certain chats conversations video quality is like FaceTiming on Craig s list terrible for meetings captions do not work never will use again until this COVID is over deleting once summer come
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingone  They give us more work on this app then they did in school and it makes me depressed that i have to do this much work in quarantine 
len ratingone Honestly I think that we have enough pressure on us already considering the corona virus outbreak 
len ratingone This is outrageous 
len ratingone  It s awful
len ratingone  Literally trash
len ratingtwo Everything is really confusing in the way it is all layer out and my biggest complaint is that the call and video call quality is really poor I can barely hold onto a conversation without needing to ask what they just said and it s not our internet it s the app because every other app works but teams and I need to call for school and work and it s all just so frustrating 
len ratingtwo  App r t t t nma m ng lag xong update m y l n r i m v n ko t i dc file app c n i u chunhr th m
len ratingone No words just hate it
len ratingone Ew just ew this is how i get my assignments that i dont wanna recive ofc 
len ratingone my teachers should get banned on there or at least ban me 
len ratingone much appreciated 
len ratingfour It is still New to me 
len ratingfour I like the capabilities it promises 
len ratingone This app is stupid don t get it
len ratingfive I like the newly integrated teams ap 
len ratingfive I hated business for Skype for few major disappointment 
len ratingfive Old messages goes to archived and extremely difficult to find 
len ratingfive Screen sharing freeze up all the time ok the old one 
len ratingfive Bottom line there are major improvements teams over Skype for business 
len ratingone it s not working
len ratingone Teams shows disturbing photos
len ratingone  Very bad app it s very slow and very hard to do school with 
len ratingone As a student using this it s absolutely stunning to see how poorly this app functions 
len ratingthree Overall Teams IM is easy to use but the phone feature is unreliable and keeps dropping calls 
len ratingthree Also emojis are limited for instance why isn t there a 
len ratingone EHY YOU GOTTA RUIN MY FUNNN
len ratingone Microsoft Teams makes me extremely stressed and overwhelmed 
len ratingone The assignments are not at all organized 
len ratingone Constantly I am missing work because the organization for the assignments is bad 
len ratingone I would like for all of the assignments to be seen with their due dates and everything all in one section instead of going through each class everyday to find out whether you have assignments or not 
len ratingone Along with this the video quality is always very poor 
len ratingone I can never hear anything that anybody else is saying and the video quality is always pixelated 
len ratingone I do NOT have an Android 
len ratingone  every time my teacher puts a link i can never see it no matter what electronic i m on 
len ratingone microsoft teams is just a toxic environment 
len ratingone my teachers bully me and give me fat stacks of work and i m sick of it 
len ratingone the assignments aren t clear teachers don t grade properly and the app has many bugs and glitches 
len ratingone round is easy and that s my ted talk 
len ratingfive teams is pretty good
len ratingfive The teams app has been a great addition to our toolbox at work especially for video conferencing 
len ratingone I can t mute threads of meetings 
len ratingone I mute it and the second I click out it un mutes 
len ratingone It s incredibly annoying especially if you re going in and out of multiple meetings 
len ratingone Very bad
len ratingone trash app
len ratingone All around slow
len ratingone  I m using this for school and I don t want to do school
len ratingone  So i was i a microsoft voice chat and the app glitched and removed from every class plus the app keeps kicking me out 
len ratingone  Dddds
len ratingfive Easy to go back and forth from the computer to the mobile app 
len ratingfive Easy to share files 
len ratingone  I just hate school
len ratingfour These are a bit funky in teams 
len ratingfive Great communication source 
len ratingfour Good app it works well aside from not being able to see presentations on the app 
len ratingfour I know it is up and running cause I checked it against a screen
len ratingthree I am looking forward to be able to open multipages documents using tab so that I can refer to those documents anytime without opening amp closing each document 
len ratingone  As a student who is forced to use tha app for school work i absolutely dispose the fact that i have to clear my notifications bandage all the time 
len ratingone the app just isn t as helpful as it should be 
len ratingone if also very confusing 
len ratingone to use rather than just using google classroom 
len ratingone there are so many simple things that could be fixed with the app yet aren t
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingone  I hate school
len ratingone  smh
len ratingone This app is a complete disappointing
len ratingone  App does not work
len ratingone  It s hard and a bad layout overall
len ratingone It s garbage
len ratingone  I don t like it cause I have to do my homework and I have contact with my annoying teachers so yea
len ratingone  No
len ratingone This the worst app of all time
len ratingone Just not my thing 
len ratingone Take it down 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingfour I m not a fan of the latest Office Suite desktop or mobile applications for full transparency this maybe because I m now having to get used to MicrosoftOS at new job after running on MacBooks for most of my career but I digress 
len ratingfour This Teams app is awesome tho on all fronts that I use it on including Mobile iOS MacOS personal laptop and Windows OS work laptop versions 
len ratingfour It s quick seamless secure SharePoint plugin works well with it and really brings what I love from both Slack and Zoom into one app 
len ratingfour I use it for Internal Comms team collaboration and now demos with new Prospects and existing Clients 
len ratingfour With Zooms security flaws and tendencies to be touchy depending on the day I ve grown increasingly sick of the dropped conferences and bad calling or screen share qualities 
len ratingfour Teams handles this extremely well 
len ratingfour It s also very clean very easy to use 
len ratingfour I hate giving Microsoft credit but overall this is quickly becoming a favorite App of mine 
len ratingfour Outlook Calendar connection is awesome feature too 
len ratingfour A couple knocks and suggestions First the screen share is a bit slow to connect at first 
len ratingfour Zoom connects a few seconds faster 
len ratingfour This is a small issue but on a Sales demo that can be an awkward few moments and can mess up flow of the meeting 
len ratingfour Once it s up runs great control panel isn t in the way I HATE that with Zoom full screen mode and is responsive 
len ratingfour I m not sure if it has the Takeover feature like Zoom where you can give someone else controls to your computer thru screen share but I ll look for it 
len ratingfour Next needs more App integrations 
len ratingfour Very limited in this area as most of the Microsoft Exchange Apps are probably for security reasons 
len ratingfour While I m sure I can chain integrate thru API connectors like Zapier wish you could do it natively thru the app 
len ratingfour Finally wish it had a true Channel feature like Slack has 
len ratingfour You can build out Groups and rename them to build something similar for sub teams or different depts but you don t get the same functionality as a true Channel like you get in Slack 
len ratingfour For now works for my purposes and I am simply knit picking at this point 
len ratingfour Overall bravo Microsoft 
len ratingfour Best app to date 
len ratingfour Now please fix Outlook for exchange that app is straight garbage and needs some serious love from you guys lol 
len ratingfour If you follow what you built here with Teams you may reconvert this diehard Mac user to WindowsOS for good 
len ratingfour Maybe 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone This app is then worst
len ratingone STOP SENDING STUDENTS UR DUMB WORK AINT NOBODY WAN DO IT
len ratingone THIS IS NOT FAIR HOW I WANT TO DO MY WORK ONLINE BUT IT ALWAYS GLITCHES AND KICKS ME OUT
len ratingfour  T
len ratingone Worst experience I ve ever had in my life
len ratingone This a big no sir i dont like it
len ratingone i rate it a one star because it doesn t let you do the work n it keeps on glitching 
len ratingone It s glitchy and horrible
len ratingone The overall idea is phenomenal although the execution is horrible
len ratingone My teacher give me to much work for this
len ratingfive I am glad to have it get messages instantly 
len ratingone Bad quality
len ratingfive Great job to Microsoft for making a great experience on every platform
len ratingone  Hello 
len ratingone I m a mother of three and all of my kids use this app to do their homework 
len ratingone The app will bug most of the time and my children s assignments will never load properly 
len ratingone Yesterday nothing will turn in and my child was trying to turn in the assignment the day it was due but it didn t went through and she ended up getting a for not turning it in 
len ratingone I recommend you guys to lease fix this problem ASAP because my child can t afford to keep on getting s on her assignments please and thank you 
len ratingone Some of my teachers isn t on this app so I can t do homework and when teachers try to open the work it doesn t let them the app is just buggy overall
len ratingfive Best screen sharing and video chat I have used yet 
len ratingone I m a student and I always wake up at cause of this this is online school and I just have it and please review it as a bad app
len ratingfive Great for working from home during this Covid pandemic 
len ratingtwo The mute button should be more easily access when in a meetings 
len ratingtwo It often takes a couple tries for me to get off mute 
len ratingtwo The app shows the outgoing audio vs the mic for some reason 
len ratingone It so bad
len ratingone Bad app do not get it glitches and is very difficult to use for school
len ratingfour I m a student and I am speaking for so many of us who are trying to be engaged and learned when j say that this is an amazing app 
len ratingfour Thank you so much 
len ratingfour Please add a block option though 
len ratingone Better to use Teams on laptop as most of the functionality is lost in app on the iPad 
len ratingone bad for your mental health 
len ratingfive We were using webex however this is a much more integrated solution 
len ratingfive Annotation function needs to be added o make it perfect
len ratingfour I would like to see more than four faces at a time on the meeting screen during video conferencing 
len ratingfour As a whole Team has a lot of potential 
len ratingfive This app is great for remote working with multiple people 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingfour I would ve given stars but it would be awesome to have the blur background option on the phone and not just in a computer
len ratingone It is confusing to use 
len ratingone No
len ratingone Horrible
len ratingfour I wanna see all videos on screen 
len ratingone App does not work well
len ratingone There is so much stuff to click and I usually can t find what I m supposed to do 
len ratingone My teams and all of my friends always says sorry something went wrong and it s not like its my WiFi 
len ratingone Teams is too slow to have a school working off of it 
len ratingone I hate it and sometimes the docs won t let me turn in or open them 
len ratingone It takes five minutes to change classes and it s all crap 
len ratingone This app has some bugs that need to Be fixed
len ratingone Just don t like the app
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone Not what I expected
len ratingfive Easy to use
len ratingone The teams App hangs while opening on iPad 
len ratingone Works fine on iPhone and Mac 
len ratingone  Bad
len ratingone  Don t recommend this for online class
len ratingthree The App has been great thus far but I would like to suggest some improvements that I feel would be helpful 
len ratingthree One is an option to view all assignments with an icon or title to say which class it is for 
len ratingthree I think this would make the assignments tab feel less cluttered and more user friendly 
len ratingthree Number is a sync that updates your schedule for the teams calendar office calendar and maybe even the phone calendar as sometimes it confusing to schedule calls when I have to view multiple calendars 
len ratingthree Teams has been beneficial during this especially hard time and I thank the developers these are just my suggestions 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingone this app is just very bad
len ratingone Eh
len ratingone  Jd
len ratingone Don t like it because I have school on it now
len ratingfour Teams is a very useful tool to get my work done and communicate with people in your workplace 
len ratingfour However teams can be a little frustrating 
len ratingfour I use teams for school and when I m going through assignments I hate just being able to look at one class s assignments at a time it would be really helpful if I could check more classes at once and not have to wait for it to load another classes assignments since I wake up in the morning scanning all the assignments and sometimes I switch between classes to see which I should do first to manage my time 
len ratingfour The teams app is also laggy when ever I go through posts 
len ratingfour I think the teams app is great but I don t think it deserve the five stars although I would put if I could but it s leaning towards 
len ratingone It s bad and it s is really hard to use
len ratingfour Not too bad I just don t think anything is perfect
len ratingone This app can have inappropriate conversations and I don t suggest having it
len ratingfive Clear and Stable connectivity with the Microsoft Teams app 
len ratingfive Fantastic
len ratingone As soon as you sign in it requires your company to have permission to manage your device which i believe gives them permission to wipe your device 
len ratingone Probably requires you to use password lock on phone 
len ratingone Just not worth the hassle and risk 
len ratingone not meant to be utilized in a classroom setting
len ratingone This app crashes more than Paul Walker
len ratingthree  Do the feature where users can enable a background behind them like Zoom 
len ratingthree Also do a screen where everybody can be seen not just people 
len ratingone This app is really bad and I have to download another app just to type an assignment 
len ratingone  This app is trash bc it glitches a lot 
len ratingfive Our office loves it 
len ratingfive I would suggest adding the video feature to the app as well 
len ratingone Bc It s really confusing to use and I can never turn in my work this app is the reason why ima failing online school ANDD MY TEACHERS CAN READ MY MESSAGES THATS NOT RIGHT I just want to hit up the homeboys mannn 
len ratingone No one likes work
len ratingone The app is about pointless it is missing critical features like being able to add people to a Team 
len ratingone I send out the link but when the click it to be added I cannot approve them 
len ratingone What s the point of having an app if you have to go back to a computer to do a lot of the stuff anyway 
len ratingone Not to mention of you use the browser safari to log into the web based it says not supported use the app 
len ratingone So again you have to go turn on a real computer 
len ratingone Just pointless 
len ratingfive MS Teams is great 
len ratingfive It does everything you need to do business and collaborate 
len ratingfive  stars 
len ratingone This app is killing me 
len ratingone I have teachers texting left and right nine stop homework and it s stressful 
len ratingone Very very stressful and upsetting 
len ratingone It s making me upset and giving me anxiety 
len ratingtwo This is the absolute worst app ever I hate it and all my friends do too
len ratingone MSU
len ratingfive It s dodo
len ratingfive Very intuitive and easy to use interface 
len ratingfive No complaints after using for six months 
len ratingfive I m glad to have these tools 
len ratingone It s bad it s super laggy and just bad
len ratingone Back to suffer
len ratingone It is very laggy it works very slow at times and I can get my work done because of it
len ratingone this microsoft teams makes kids stressed and that s not good because it brings anxiety
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingone  I hate it my teachers give too much homework we never have a brakeeeeee AHHHHHHHH please end this app ty
len ratingone  Disappointed
len ratingfive It has saved my work life and helped us stay connected 
len ratingfive Great application loving it 
len ratingone It s all over the place and messy 
len ratingone It just doesn t suit me 
len ratingone It s very complicated to join in on a meeting and when I do get in a meeting it says there is an error 
len ratingone  Basically I gave it one star so we don t have to use it for school and it is kinda hard to use
len ratingfive Really portable version of the Teams desktop app and great interface 
len ratingfive No complaints what so ever and Microsoft did a great job with this app 
len ratingone The app lags a lot and it doesn t load in any way at all
len ratingfour It won t let me 
len ratingone Presentation kept freezing or had several minutes of delay
len ratingthree Good app under development 
len ratingthree Useful so far Biggest things missed is that only people can join a meeting sometimes we need interactive participation so this tool is not there yet 
len ratingthree Only participants per screen you could see apps like zoom let you see more 
len ratingthree Quality and sound is far better than Skype 
len ratingfour I don t want online work 
len ratingone The app is very glitchy
len ratingfive It s so practical and useful for the team to Organize your files Get privacy for some files Work jointly on documents and amend it video call work even with unstable internet calendar to link your meetings from your original calendar 
len ratingfive And more to explore
len ratingone Boof
len ratingfour When a Teams message comes through Outlook email the alert is incredibly annoying Hi Your teammates are trying to reach you in Microsoft Teams As if we re not stuck at home staring at our computers 
len ratingfour As if we re out picking daisies 
len ratingone  I don t think we should use this app because it has to many links just to get to one answer 
len ratingone Good app it would be nice to have changeable backgrounds
len ratingone im giving this app star because i don t wanna do homework
len ratingone It s way to laggy I have good WiFi but is so laggy you can t join classes 
len ratingtwo I got it on my iPad for school work and when I go into it the app won t even load in 
len ratingtwo Not to mention when my class has work the only thing we are talking about is we can t work cause the tab that we go into where all are work is won t load so it s very hard to get work done when we can t get to our work 
len ratingtwo It s happening to everyone in my class and classes at the same time 
len ratingfive This is the best App 
len ratingfive The video and sound has never had an issue 
len ratingfive The resolution is fantastic 
len ratingfive This is so much better than Skype 
len ratingfour Save our sales organization during the COVID pandemic 
len ratingfour Has also shown us how productive we can be working remotely 
len ratingone Teams might help me learn but if ur being real who tf wants to learn
len ratingone I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS APP WHY WOULD U LET TEACHER ASSIGN STUFF I HAVE ASSIGNMENTS YOU PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL STUDENTS
len ratingone just delete the app
len ratingone trash app
len ratingone  Sorry I would have put stars if this wasn t for studying but now my school uses it for studying that is so annoying 
len ratingone Ch t l ng cu c g i k m v ng truy n kh ng n nh
len ratingone When I m on the app it just bugs out and it doesn t save for me
len ratingone Trash
len ratingone  Inline gif search but I can t search the wiki 
len ratingone Not effective
len ratingone Worst app ever 
len ratingfive The app is letting my school and other school to do school online to still learn during this time 
len ratingone It is not good app don t get it
len ratingone Lost all my assignments and got a F
len ratingone Wrestled with this app for hours trying to get it to use my iPad s camera with no luck 
len ratingone My office has Office but it looks like we are going to have to rely on Zoom for video conferences 
len ratingone App is terrible don t like it one bit teachers take advantage of it
len ratingone I hate looking at this app
len ratingone Nah this is not it you need to get rid of it and fix it
len ratingfour Not getting notifications before the last update it was ok please fix it thanks 
len ratingone me no like 
len ratingone I NEED FREEDOM
len ratingone Everything seems great to me at first meaning I created the account and yeah 
len ratingone Then I try to login and I can t 
len ratingone So I try again in the evening alright it said I needed the Office Education thingy Okk I signed up for it then I get onto some sort of thing and then I click teams but guess what it said it said You need to download teams but I already did so is it my problem or the app s problem 
len ratingone Never use this app 
len ratingone My daughter is in the third grade and she had to do online school because of the corona virus 
len ratingone The app was very laggy when my daughter was trying to use it also my daughter turn in her assignment and her work got corrupted she had to restart all her assignments again 
len ratingone The system always have these Error messages nonstop for these two weeks the system would not open or load in things properly 
len ratingone Please can you fix the app so that everything will be a times better 
len ratingone Horrible app
len ratingone Some might say it s the worst app in the app store please don t waste your time and download such a terrible app
len ratingone instead of sending my nudes to just my teacher they got posted to the whole class 
len ratingone STUPID TEAMS 
len ratingone Dont get this app 
len ratingfour All good but would like to leverage tags in Channels so users don t have to be added one at a time 
len ratingone Has never worked
len ratingone It showed weird stuff to my child
len ratingone WORST APP IN THE WORLD I SWEAR ZOOM IS BETTER THAN THIS DON T USE THIS APP EVER
len ratingfive During COVID Teams became a staple for my office to communicate in real time without being on the phone all day while we all worked remotely 
len ratingfive Never had any issues and there are lots of features that are incredibly useful for office work 
len ratingfive Effective
len ratingone So because of the corona virus me and my sister where assigned our assignments in TEAMS but our assignments for some reason are being mixed up it must be fixed 
len ratingone It shows my teachers in her account 
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone This application has so many bugs and issues working 
len ratingone So frustrating trying to work this app 
len ratingfive Teams has allowed us to continue working together virtually with ease 
len ratingfive Whether we are using the video conferences chats or sharing files it has made working outside if the office an efficient and productive process 
len ratingfive Thank you Teams 
len ratingfive Is there a way to see more people in a Team Meeting 
len ratingfour The audio and presentation quality is great in teams but the ability to only show video feeds at any one time is a knock compared to Zoom 
len ratingfive This app
len ratingfive Communication has become fluent and transparent utilizing this app 
len ratingone When you have teams installed on multiple devices only one device gets the notification and on my iPad which I use all the time for teams I don t get anything whereas the notifications are sent to the iPhone which I never use for teams 
len ratingone It s like Skype years ago 
len ratingone Hello my people this is a no reason review 
len ratingfive With all of this working from home stuff 
len ratingfive I am finally able to stay in contact with my team 
len ratingfive Keep the features coming 
len ratingone doesn t work 
len ratingone it s extremely slow 
len ratingone It s to complicated and buggy and I found it hard to use especially during like a classroom call because I would bug out even my friends said app
len ratingone Hi his app I used for school and the f cking app won t even let me view my asinments 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive We have been using it for years 
len ratingfive Lots of smart features 
len ratingfour Very versatile and easy to use 
len ratingfour Challenges with audio and skipping at times but the app is a good one 
len ratingfive Great collaboration tool 
len ratingfive My teacher s make learning fun 
len ratingfive Reliable and good audio quality
len ratingone My biggest complaint as a teacher trying to use teams for the first time is that all your videos only seem to cover the desktop version 
len ratingone Even bigger when I creat an assignment and I am typing the directions you only get two visible lines of text on the screen using an iPad Pro 
len ratingone I have to constantly scroll up and down with only two visible lines 
len ratingone The desktop version when you create an assignment the text for the directions expands so you can see all you text 
len ratingone Please fix this soon 
len ratingfive Teams makes communicating so much easier
len ratingfive An all in one product that performes 
len ratingfive Trams APP AOS seamless 
len ratingfive Allows you to communicate on the move 
len ratingfive Very impressive and has never locked up 
len ratingone  Laggy and I can t speak
len ratingone So bad get it taken away apple
len ratingone  I don t like it at all it is so laggyyyyy
len ratingone Horrible it s all I have to say
len ratingone Every ghetto would not recommend 
len ratingone  This app is so bad for online meetings everytime I join it just kicks me out of the meeting saying there was a problem and it says rejoin I click and it just kicks me out again on mobile and on PC 
len ratingone Teachers be ode annoying
len ratingone The app has horrible usage and lagges easily unlike other ones I used and it is very hard to use because their are so many buttons
len ratingone we don t like this app bc it is an app where if your a student teachers give you HW
len ratingone Poep
len ratingone Worst app
len ratingfive  My teacher said download this app so um oh it corona time offfff
len ratingone I ve been trying to use it for a whole week and it doesn t work all it does is load
len ratingone very glitchy and terrible
len ratingfour Video chat needs the capability to view more than just people at once 
len ratingfive Works well 
len ratingfive  Kudos to Microsoft for coming up with the most user friendly with high level of clarity amongst the many also ran 
len ratingone This is not an app 
len ratingone It just takes you to the website and says this app is not compatible with safari and to use Microsoft edge 
len ratingone This is not an iOS app and should be removed from the App Store 
len ratingone Don t bother installing 
len ratingone  ang ngh d ch m b t h c h c c i u bu i tao y n y
len ratingone  This app is a disaster
len ratingone  Do not use app it s not good 
len ratingfive I have been using the app as part of my company s business continuity plan in the wake of the COVID pandemic and work has been seamless effective and excellent 
len ratingone  It s good but I don t want to study lol
len ratingone worst app ever 
len ratingone If you download the mobile app it will let you sign in then it ll take you to a page similar to the website 
len ratingone From there you have to sign in again to set up a team and then it says it s not supported and you have to download the app ON THE APP 
len ratingone Absolutely worthless app however on desktop it works quite well and would recommend on there
len ratingone Its very complicated and it dosent help us
len ratingfour Only request is that they would clean up the UI UX when working within the threaded conversations 
len ratingone It is from Microsoft what can you expect 
len ratingone It eats ram is utilitarian in design and has sooooo much extra over design that renders the app more annoying than useful 
len ratingone  Get reked
len ratingone very stupid i hate it bye
len ratingone  the teachers send us to much work
len ratingone I just updated this app today after using it perfectly all week this week 
len ratingone Today I updated it and now it doesn t even go pass the loading screen it just crashes 
len ratingone I need this app back up by Monday for school 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingfour It would be incredibly helpful for all of us remote working during COVID 
len ratingfour We know it s coming please accelerate 
len ratingfive There is a learning curve but nothing out of the ordinary 
len ratingfive Great experience so far and easy to interact with co workers 
len ratingfive Found it very useful especially when WFH 
len ratingfour I ve never used slack but teams gets the job done 
len ratingfour We use it daily 
len ratingtwo  This action couldn t be performed because Office doesn t recognize the command it was given 
len ratingtwo If only office was a Microsoft product as well 
len ratingfive Hey I really have no affinity for Microsoft as a brand or producer of software until now 
len ratingfive To my surprise Teams is Apple good 
len ratingfive I m a new fan 
len ratingfive Bgjdjgfjdhdhd
len ratingfive This application is so user friendly and easy to communicate with multiple people 
len ratingfive It s very up to date and functions so well 
len ratingfive As always thank you Microsoft 
len ratingthree There is a lag at times 
len ratingthree Several minutes or till I activate one or the other app 
len ratingfive It is very reliable easy to use navigate thru and fast 
len ratingfive This app has been critical to communicating with the office staff during th global pandemic 
len ratingfive It s functional easy to use and convenient 
len ratingfive  I enjoy this app 
len ratingfive It made it easy for everyone to connect to the call 
len ratingfive This app works seamlessly probably better than the Windows version 
len ratingone I have virtual training practices that use this interface 
len ratingone On pc it s very easy to use but on the mobile app it s impossible 
len ratingone The app first prompts you with the sign in page 
len ratingone I sign in with my gmail and the page says I do not have teams set up on the account 
len ratingone I press the sign up button it takes me to the teams page but nowhere is there anything on how to set up teams on my account 
len ratingone Please please please allow this to be as easy as it is on pc with only an entry link required 
len ratingthree I don t like that I can only see team members at a time 
len ratingthree Zoom is better because I can see every participant not just when they speak 
len ratingthree It s really difficult for me to learn fast too much at one time however when I focus concentrate on learning the steps one by one and then putting them together really taking the time it works better for my learning style 
len ratingthree And then I get it 
len ratingfive The teams app has been a blessing especially now with all the remote working options 
len ratingfive Thanks Microsoft for doing a great job with it 
len ratingone It s been nearly four hours with several different help desk people for Microsoft 
len ratingone Still doesn t work 
len ratingone I suggest you use something else 
len ratingone Zoom ring central 
len ratingone Anything 
len ratingone Doesn t download or let you sign in 
len ratingone Circular referencez
len ratingfive Easy tonuse
len ratingfour Only thing I would change is the assignments tab 
len ratingfour I would have it where you can just see what work you have 
len ratingfour I don t want to select every class and search for what I have to do in every class 
len ratingfour It would be much simpler if it only showed me the assignments I have instead of me having to select the class to look for an assignment 
len ratingfive Teams has been around for a while but my company is finally retiring Skype for business and I ve been using teams a lot more 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive This is the best collaboration software today 
len ratingfive It unites all Microsoft s utility apps in one powerful user friendly and light application gives everyone in the organisation the chance to contribute while respecting hierarchy 
len ratingone  It s just really bad
len ratingfour Teams is great 
len ratingfour We use it throughout our company for messaging across locations posting on all staff boards 
len ratingfour Even video conferencing 
len ratingone the app has features that the website doesn t but the app does not work of the time 
len ratingone deleting and redownloading never fixes the issue and microsoft is difficult to contact and drags their feet to fix problems 
len ratingfour After call reports are atrocious 
len ratingfour Small examples no accounting of who joined a call or when they joined 
len ratingfour Additionally only People in the viewing window is seriously inadequate 
len ratingfive Great app I never have troubles with and love how phone friendly it is 
len ratingfour Using teams more than ever now that we re all staying home and it s been quite helpful to get quick questions fired off 
len ratingfour Only giving stars because we tried to do a big video call and teams limited the number of people on screen showing to even though there were of us on the call 
len ratingfour Seems like with the high demand they limited it but let s keep up teams 
len ratingfour Don t let zoom beat you out 
len ratingfive For business if connected to SharePoint this is the best collaboration tool 
len ratingtwo Mainly with everything transitioning online these days from classes to office work everybody is relying on teams because of Microsoft name but there are so many issues that needs to be fixed 
len ratingtwo  Files 
len ratingtwo Please make it possible to share files through iphone and ipad apps without all of that Sharepoint and whatever bs 
len ratingtwo I literally have to fire up my laptop everytime I have to share some files to my group in teams improve video recordings this is a great feature and I have been using it in skype for so long but after using teams most of the times video recordings literally freeze up only audio gets recorded and when I go to a few days later to the video only audio is there but video is completely frozen at a frame although I know it was not like that during the actually meeting 
len ratingtwo  and UI is just so complicated for some reason 
len ratingtwo I have had so many small meetings where we begin with teams but everything gets so complicated that we just switch over to skype 
len ratingtwo Somebody said it right UI is like a joke if you have to explain it it is not good 
len ratingtwo  I am in education field and I am very used to working with whiteboards in class and so feel many of my colleagues but after transitioning online and being forced to work with teams I was genuinely happy that there was whiteboard feature but it is so laggy that if more than two people join in it starts to go haywire 
len ratingtwo I have been using onenote for my ipad for so long now maybe I got spoiled by onenote but seeing the poor performance from teams while onenote which also Ms owns hurt me a little bit 
len ratingtwo  I don t know how the rules of using ideas from one department to another goes I am just customer and I am just letting you guys know what I want and if somebody else offers those options before you guys I am switching so please Ms Teams team improve it because although I know of better alternatives than teams because of Microsoft credibility I have to be stuck with teams 
len ratingone  The most important feature of any communication program is alerting 
len ratingone Teams does NOT alert for me 
len ratingone HERE is my scenario My iPads is a third computer screen and it runs TEAMS all the time 
len ratingone The screen does not timeout 
len ratingone Unfortunately Teams when run like this does NOT alert 
len ratingone It is apparently written to assume someone is looking at the screen if the screen is being displayed 
len ratingone The only solution is to run teams in the background of one on my computer so at least i get the alert 
len ratingone PITA 
len ratingfour This app is a very useful tool to all students who can t go to school especially in this time of quarantine 
len ratingfour At first the app is a little confusing but as you move on you get the hang of it 
len ratingfour I love that I can stay in contact with all my fellow classmates and teachers 
len ratingfour We are all able to help each other when we have questions and can stay in contact 
len ratingfour Thank you for making online school so much easier 
len ratingthree Works great and is an all in one system but you can only run one instance of a meeting 
len ratingthree For example you can only be in one meeting at a time whereas using Skype I can log into multiple meeting to multi task 
len ratingfour Seriously
len ratingfour Teams app is much better than Skype for sure but can t be compared with Slack 
len ratingfour Lots of improvements are needed like colorfulness notification speed etc needs to be improved 
len ratingfive It is absolutely Great for meetings and viritual school you can chat and it s kid friendly to but a little advanced but it s something i would recommend to everyone
len ratingfive Teams allows me to do everything seamlessly communicate amp access all within one platform 
len ratingfive Felicitaciones que excelente herramienta de verdad que en esta poca de crisis mundial ha sido una herramienta que le ha permitido a las empresas colegios y universidades continuar con sus labores
len ratingfour Would like to be able to see all attendees in the video function 
len ratingfour Right now only shows 
len ratingone Concept of teams is great but the delivery fails 
len ratingone It has so many issues and it depends on what devices are being used as it s compatible with some more than others 
len ratingone Microsoft stream makes me pull my hair out 
len ratingone Hyperlinks to videos does not click at one button 
len ratingone I click times and all it does is highlight 
len ratingone I click around the hyperlink in the hyperlink around the message box and after a minute of spastic clicking it finally opens in a window in which theatre mode is not theatre mode 
len ratingone It cuts off this is across different types of devices and whether it s web or app based 
len ratingone Unfortunately I have to use teams 
len ratingone Had I not Microsoft would have to pay me to use this app 
len ratingone  I like farting
len ratingthree I gave it starts only because it doesn t have it to where you can see everyone on the call at the same time 
len ratingthree It only has people up at a time 
len ratingthree If y all fix this you can compete with zoom until then 
len ratingfive Thank you for automatically hiding video if people are muted 
len ratingfive It makes so much sense and leads others to use video a lot more during interactive meetings 
len ratingfive MICROSOFT Teams is the greatest collaboration tool ever 
len ratingfive The features of Teams make it easy to stay in touch with your coworkers during this global heath crisis 
len ratingfive The video feature as well as the Chat feature make it as close to in person as you can be these days 
len ratingfive Teams is consistently reliable and enables great productivity while being in a situation that only permits remote work 
len ratingfive Kudos to the team pun intended 
len ratingfive at MICROSOFT that developed this product 
len ratingfive The only draw back to this app is that is generates an email each time someone sends or replies 
len ratingfive If there was a way to turn that feature off it would be perfect 
len ratingfive  You can do everything you want on this app and the merge with mobile makes it the ultimate efficiency performer 
len ratingone App not working on iPad the app opens but doesn t allow for no signin option
len ratingthree I was working in the middle of something and went onto Edge only to find out after just ONE MINUTE it exited me out of the assignment 
len ratingthree You gotta fix this because all my classmates are angry too 
len ratingthree Overall great collaboration tool allowing us to join meetings remotely share screen and record meetings 
len ratingthree Connection quality is varying and not dependable 
len ratingthree When compared with google hangout teams fares moderately in overall ease of use and connection 
len ratingtwo I love MS Teams but it is so lame that you cannot add Planner tab in private channels 
len ratingtwo I would like to organize tasks within closed circle of people and I am not able to do right now 
len ratingtwo It make you 
len ratingtwo Glitched out every hour
len ratingfour My only complaint is that Teams absolutely DRAINS my system s resources 
len ratingfour I enjoy the functions and it works very well but it slows my machine down incredibly 
len ratingfour Not sure if there s a fix there but still 
len ratingfive There s a bug where you join a meeting through meeting notification if you have muted your mic before join it will unmute automatically 
len ratingfive Please fix that
len ratingtwo The app works but it needs more than simultaneous video streams desperately 
len ratingfour Yo mute during a call requires two screen touches and is annoying 
len ratingfour Should be able to one touch mute
len ratingfive It s a good chat because I can talk to my friends
len ratingfour  I like how the iPhone Teams app allows me to switch to a different Teams Account 
len ratingfour However when I attempt to use this option on my computer the Teams software used for computers does not allow this 
len ratingfour It is imperative this be made available on computers as it is cumbersome to log out of one account and into another 
len ratingfive  great to use if your school is closed during corona virus
len ratingone useless for taking meetings as a conference call on your bluetooth headset 
len ratingone as soon as the screen locks the meeting is disconnected 
len ratingone MS must ad an option to maintain the audio stream so this can be used when you can t sit and stare at your phone and poke it to keep it from locking 
len ratingfive Really easy and user friendly
len ratingfour Jumping between two devices Teams keeps up 
len ratingfour Skype drops messages 
len ratingfive Longtime Skype for business user with varied results 
len ratingfive Moving to teams is night and day 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingfive Great for
len ratingfive It really is great
len ratingone This app like certain facilities for working with multiple groups and all round is very slow compared to other apps out there 
len ratingfour My team loves using Teams now that we have migrated to it but for having meeting with external partners it s clunky 
len ratingfour There is no way for them to join from a mobile device without downloading the app 
len ratingthree We have teams set up for an auto attendant and call queue 
len ratingthree When we set an iPhone or XR to receive we cannot answer the incoming calls 
len ratingthree Specifically the phone rings a notification comes up on screen along with the slide to answer 
len ratingthree Sliding to answer at first seems like it is going to work but drops the call 
len ratingthree Oddly enough if the iPhone is in an unlocked state and this is attempted it works perfectly 
len ratingthree However there is no slide bar only an accept button in that scenario 
len ratingthree I believe there is something broken with the slide bar in this app 
len ratingfive Great platform we were able to switch all of our three offices to work remotely while at the same time we were able to maintain collaboration and communication between different teams and locations 
len ratingfive We also noticed that within first two week so far of working remotely our overall efficiency went up 
len ratingfive M
len ratingfour I love this app 
len ratingfour The video quality when using from an iPhone is a little off though 
len ratingfour It shows your face extremely zoomed in on other people s screens not your own which can be a little awkward when you re trying to have virtual meetings with clients or customers and they have a close up of your face 
len ratingfour If that improved or you could have the option to change the zoom setting this app would basically be perfect 
len ratingone I can t even log in the log in button is not even functional
len ratingfour I manage multiple teams 
len ratingfour I love how I can have multiple teams to separate everyone and still be able to quickly engage with my team members 
len ratingfour Fast efficient communication when working remotely 
len ratingfour Great platform for quickly consolidating info and communicating 
len ratingfour Well throughout 
len ratingfour The main challenge I have is not being able to open things in another window e g meetings chats when I m working on on something 
len ratingfour I ve taken to loading the web app for meetings and the desktop app for a doc simultaneously so I can work in and see both 
len ratingthree The video feature on the iPad version does not work initially if the person signs in as a guest 
len ratingthree It makes it difficult to do a video conference when only one person has video capability 
len ratingfive Please 
len ratingfive  I like having everything I need in one location so I don t have a bunch of different apps to use 
len ratingfive If you can t find what you need in the basic apps there is an App Store to search through 
len ratingfour Started using MS Teams for teleworking due to State ordered shelter in place a few weeks ago 
len ratingfour Other than not knowing how to turn off OOO notifications from team members in chat I REALLY like this tool 
len ratingfour Easy to learn intuitive and conference call function MUCH better than WebEx 
len ratingfour Go Teams 
len ratingfive Been using the Teams app on my phone when away from my work computer and it worked flawlessly 
len ratingfive Just took a video call from my boss and answered with the phone app and was surprised at how smooth and effortless it was great quality 
len ratingthree Teams is ok we use it heavily at work 
len ratingthree Background battery usage is becoming a huge problem for me though and there are no settings in the app that could help to bring it under control 
len ratingthree This app is using battery without even being opened 
len ratingthree I understand that for someone with multiple team memberships and many channels updating there may be a lot of data being polled all the time but make some improvements in efficiency here or at least let us tailor it in some way 
len ratingfour Haven t quite figured out how all the features work but I m sure that once I do I ll render the other star 
len ratingfive Great platform for quarantined co workers 
len ratingfive This allows us to continue forward to achieve excellence 
len ratingfive One question 
len ratingfive Can the app have a sound when a new message or post is sent 
len ratingfive Perfect App Thanks
len ratingfive Fantastic way to stay in touch at the office
len ratingthree The intent of the app is really good but it is just very confusing to understand where to find files and which ones are the ones could have to do with people not understanding how to use the app but the fact that you can share files through many places and it s not easy to see what assignments you have to do and you can t check them off easily makes it complicated 
len ratingthree Thank you
len ratingfive Teams works so well it does exactly what it promises 
len ratingfive I could not be happier with how much power I have to lead my team from my cell phone Teams app 
len ratingfive Just awesome 
len ratingfive Its very usefull and from MS after a ling tome 
len ratingfive Integrated with all the services and light weight
len ratingthree I really like this application but it appears that we are only able to see people at a time
len ratingfour Wish there were more video panels during video conference 
len ratingfive Our office cannot imagine working without this platform 
len ratingfive Excellent and highly recommended
len ratingfive Really impressed with the mobile app works as well as the desktop app 
len ratingfive Awesome collaboration tool overall 
len ratingfive Teams Excellent tool 
len ratingfive Worth its weight in gold 
len ratingfive Teams has been a lifesaver to our agency and our business communications these past few weeks 
len ratingfive We will continue to use it more and more in the weeks months years to come 
len ratingfive Thank you for the opp to give this feedback 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingfive It s better to have real time collaboration whiteboard feature
len ratingfour Need seamless handoff phone gt computer and back World clock at the top
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingone bad app 
len ratingone doesn t work good 
len ratingfive Desktop and mobile it all works great 
len ratingone It keeps opening a new link through the app then starts asking me to download the app when i already have it 
len ratingone Logging in is the biggest pain
len ratingfive Better than WebEx 
len ratingfive Wish it had virtual backgrounds like Zoom 
len ratingfive I m not one to stop and take the time to write a review but if an app has ever deserved some praise it would be this one 
len ratingfive My opinion is based solely on a few weeks of heavy use of Teams since COVID has forced our crew to rapidly transition to working from home so there could still be a slight chance that what I say fails to take all circumstances into account 
len ratingfive That being said I really have enjoyed Teams as a collaborative tool 
len ratingfive I ve organized and participated in meetings with multiple users usually or up to on a few occasions and the Teams interface has functioned flawlessly almost every time 
len ratingfive Screen sharing with audio communication video conferencing and group presentations are the features I ve used the most and they are all user friendly and simple to execute 
len ratingfive The multi user meetings with content sharing even worked well on my iPhone this was something that truly impressed me 
len ratingfive Plus there s a give control option that you can use if you need hands on help trouble shooting an issue on your device fyi I ve only used this feature on our company s Macs and PC s haven t tried it on a phone or tablet 
len ratingfive In summary a few weeks in and I ve got nothing but praise for Microsoft Teams
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingfive After using the Teams app I found it so convenient to connect with my colleagues and communicate through group meetings 
len ratingfive The audio quality is good the ease at which you can communicate and set up conference calls makes working from home really convenient 
len ratingfive The best part it is really simple to use 
len ratingfive App is awesome and easy to use 
len ratingtwo To go to a chat group you should not have to click more than once 
len ratingthree There needs to be an easy way to import an I calendar that the whole team can view but not edit 
len ratingfive You can do is when you are not at school you can talk to your teachers and you can also do your work
len ratingone My teacher found my address from here and stalked me for weeks until he was caught by police and The video quality isn t very well 
len ratingone  Yo on my mother dis app is disgusting and I am deleting dis when quarantine is done 
len ratingone Y all lucky I gotta use dis
len ratingfive I like how easy to use the app is
len ratingfour My school uses this app for online school because of the coronavirus 
len ratingfour I think this app is pretty good 
len ratingfour I love the little animations after you turn in the assignments 
len ratingfour I have a suggestion to making the app more better 
len ratingfour For the Assignments category you should list all of the assignments in all of the teams that the account is in by the date they re due instead of picking individual teams because that will take a lot of time 
len ratingfour I m sorry if my opinion is bad or it offends you 
len ratingfour Thank you for reading this and have a nice day 
len ratingone How is it private when you can t delete chatted only thing you can do is delete your own conversation 
len ratingone  times boss comes in to read others chat why did they change from Skype to this garbage
len ratingtwo Logging in is a pain 
len ratingtwo If you get in it s a great thing to use 
len ratingtwo But otherwise you are just missing out and frustrated 
len ratingone Idk what to do it s confusing
len ratingfive Nice and so convenient
len ratingfive Although I also love Slack
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingthree I would give stars if you are able to delete complete conversation 
len ratingfive Very useful and reliable at home and at work too 
len ratingfive Great picture and sound 
len ratingfive David M 
len ratingfour It s not very easy or intuitive to do the screen share and I would rather throw together a conference call web meeting with say two three or four like minded people 
len ratingfour It seems really obvious that the product could do that 
len ratingfour Adoption and data are more important than the small amount of revenue you would collect by charging for that service 
len ratingfour Come on Microsoft 
len ratingfour Release the fancy stuff 
len ratingfour It s a Corona Virus pandemic 
len ratingfour This would be seen by your customers as a magnanimous gesture of good will 
len ratingfour I m feeling it 
len ratingfour Can t wait to try out the cool stuff 
len ratingfour I still have a lot to learn 
len ratingfour So far I like what I see 
len ratingone It made me do school on this
len ratingfive This is one great product
len ratingtwo It would be helpful if teams allowed conversion threads to be deleted 
len ratingfive Teams has been so helpful during this time of quarantine and having to work from home 
len ratingfive The company I work for uses teams for everything and it s been so convenient easy to use and dependable 
len ratingfour Need to be able to detach conversations when multiple ones occurring as it is possible in Skype 
len ratingone I don t like online school but the app is so glitchy and hard to use it makes me angry
len ratingfour It makes it easy to stay in contact with others 
len ratingfive Just started working with it and love the quality of it 
len ratingfive I am using an iOS device and notifications cannot be seen nor can I disable or enable them 
len ratingfive Can you please fix this 
len ratingfive Hi Josh
len ratingone Disorganized 
len ratingone Your in one team but see all other teams assignments or grades 
len ratingone Students can t log in easily 
len ratingone Constant issues 
len ratingone Hard to post videos for teachers 
len ratingone I should be able to add a random person to the call 
len ratingone Not a fan but required to use for work 
len ratingone Google Classrooms was easier when used with other district 
len ratingfive Much more intuitive and fluids
len ratingfive This app is smooth and easy to use 
len ratingfive The desktop app is also great and transitioning between the two is seamless 
len ratingfive I like how well it ties into the other Microsoft office software
len ratingone Not every user friendly 
len ratingone Pain to use
len ratingfive I cannot do voice call or do video call on iPhone Xr because iPhone permissions issue 
len ratingfive I try to enable the permissions but it does not exist in settings 
len ratingfive Please fix 
len ratingfive Teams has enabled us to continue with our important work without skipping a beat excepting the intuitive download and set up process during this historic global disruption 
len ratingfive Thank you for making possible for collaborative use this extraordinary interactive medium 
len ratingfive Corona O o
len ratingfive Working remotely we moved to the Teams app and I ve been very happy with the ease of use and the call features 
len ratingfive It has really helped us stay connected with everything from simple chats to video calls 
len ratingfive It was easy to figure out and to set up 
len ratingfive And the GIFS are keeping us entertained 
len ratingfive Just a great way to connect while at work 
len ratingfive Gives you a great creative space to work 
len ratingfive When you are done for the day you can turn off the notifications and enjoy home life 
len ratingfive This is a great app for collaborating with coworkers 
len ratingfive Especially when everyone is working from home 
len ratingfive I would highly recommend this app 
len ratingthree Why teams only allows to see persons in the screen 
len ratingthree Should be increase like zoom 
len ratingthree Please
len ratingfour Awesome
len ratingfive This app is great for business meetings and notes I love itd
len ratingfive The app itself is very good 
len ratingfive But the quality of the FaceTime and audio call is ok 
len ratingfive It might act up a bit but it might be because it isn t use to your Wi Fi Or the other person your talking to might have bad internet 
len ratingfive So you should being buying this app for your kids to be learning from their teachers while being at home 
len ratingfive Hope y all are having a Fantastic day 
len ratingfive Be blessed bye 
len ratingfive Now ask me how I like the Skype app 
len ratingfive This app has helped my work from home transition to be extremely smooth 
len ratingfive It allows me to stay connected on the go 
len ratingfive Having this app is like having my laptop with me 
len ratingfive Convenience to reach out to colleagues in a Crisis such as the Covid 
len ratingfour Would be nice to have more than video streams 
len ratingfour Similar to Zoom 
len ratingfour Would be nice
len ratingfive Whole this softwares always hovered in The background in these strange times it really kept our business going 
len ratingfive Thank you for developing this from a really appreciative small business 
len ratingone What a piece of junk 
len ratingone From my desktop I go to the Teams website and it wants to know if I d like to download the app from Google Play or the App Store uh no not from my desktop you idiots 
len ratingone Next I get the app on iPad and when I try to accept an invitation to a team it takes me to safari and safari wants to know if I d like to download the desktop app uh no not on my iPad you idiots 
len ratingone I can t accept the invitation from within the app it keeps taking me to safari and safari won t open it it keeps saying I need the desktop app 
len ratingone Also I can t delete the Team I created on my own and don t want anymore 
len ratingone Again what a piece of junk 
len ratingfive Using Teams for more than months 
len ratingfive It s integration with Outlook and ease of setting up calls meetings is remarkable
len ratingthree In the assignment tab it was useful and simple to click on it and see all your assignments for all classes 
len ratingthree Now you have made it to where you have to go into each individual class to see ur assignments 
len ratingthree That makes it very easy to miss one little assignment it was much easier when you would simply click on the assignments tab and could see ALL ASSIGNMENTS FOR ALL CLASSES 
len ratingthree That needs to be fixed immediately 
len ratingone I can t login no matter where I go and what I use 
len ratingone I ve used the username my school fave me and it did it work 
len ratingone I used my own personal email and it didn t work either 
len ratingone I can t do it 
len ratingone I m still having trouble and online school starts tomorrow 
len ratingthree Easy install 
len ratingthree Picked up my calendar but I can t easily link it to my contacts 
len ratingthree I ll resort to downloading email address to Excel 
len ratingthree Too ol school 
len ratingfive this do be good for corona doe 
len ratingone The app is not intuitive 
len ratingone It provides no buttons to investigate what is wrong 
len ratingone Google hangouts is easier 
len ratingthree I
len ratingone I just want it to drop from App Store
len ratingtwo The assignments view for students isn t very streamlined 
len ratingtwo You need to go through each class you re in to check if you have any assignments 
len ratingtwo A unified inbox would be much better 
len ratingone Doesn t work
len ratingfive My whole team has lost channel notification both on ios and PC 
len ratingfive No changes to the configurations have been made 
len ratingfive Please fix ASAP 
len ratingfive Otherwise superb tool for office communication and keeps getting better 
len ratingfive More than just video conferencing 
len ratingfive It is a collaboration platform that offers a digital office 
len ratingfive What do you need on the office 
len ratingfive Calendars files telephony meetings task management notes workflows etc 
len ratingfive With Microsoft teams you can get it all 
len ratingtwo Microsoft Teams is great but there s this one thing that needs to be fixed 
len ratingtwo In a call you can only see yourself and other people so that means that we can t see everyone and it s very annoying because we want to see what their doing we should see everyone at the same time 
len ratingtwo If you want to have online call meetings I suggest to use Zoom Meetings if they don t fix this 
len ratingone The latest update causes the app to crash when using CarPlay 
len ratingone Prior to that the app s audio would only work on CarPlay while on mute 
len ratingone This app is very complicated and hard to navigate 
len ratingone It also keeps disconnecting and I have fibre optic so it is not a wifi issue I do not recommend this app 
len ratingone It clearly was not prepared for this 
len ratingfive Great app to monitor your groups and check in with work 
len ratingfive Can see uploaded docs 
len ratingfive And its easy to search though conversations 
len ratingfive Don t have to full access to edit docs but didn t expect that 
len ratingfive The video chat and calling is better then FaceTime or other apps I ve used 
len ratingone Bbbbbbbaaaddddd appppppppp daaaa
len ratingfive I invested the time into figuring out how it works and I m happy I did 
len ratingfive For sure it blows away our previous VOIP provider while also integrates with all the Office APPS ohhh and our team members in the office all like it too 
len ratingfive Quien m s est descargando esto de HISD
len ratingfive Enjoying not having tons of emails but in tip of what matters 
len ratingfive Great service
len ratingfive Have never a better app for virtual connect
len ratingthree Still not up to Slack s level but solid first go for Microsoft 
len ratingthree Hoping to see more emojis soon 
len ratingone  I don t like online school so I want it removed
len ratingthree The UI is confusing and overwhelming the learning curve is a little steeper because of it 
len ratingthree Biggest drawback HUGE is only people can be seen at a time on the screen 
len ratingthree That is super frustrating 
len ratingthree Please tell us you are going to change that so all people in the meeting can be seen at the same time like zoom 
len ratingthree Benefit Microsoft backed so works well for work and with Office suite but honestly the person on screen limitation is a significant drawback 
len ratingfive I liked it seems very good and bug free
len ratingfive This app is such so amazing 
len ratingfive I was initially skeptical to use it since the blunder Microsoft did to Skype after buying it but was pleasantly surprised with the reviews and after being a constant user love this app 
len ratingone No
len ratingfive  With the whole COVID epidemic this was perfect to keep in touch with my school although there s room for improvements I love it 
len ratingfive Teams has always been a great productivity and communication tool but with the current global crisis and so many people working remotely it has become an essential part of how our company stays in touch 
len ratingfive Group chats audio and video calls meetings calendars all of it in one place and already integrated with our business though our O tenant 
len ratingthree It s all very high tech but am getting more used to it
len ratingfive Works Great 
len ratingfive Only issue I ve seen is that it will use half iPhone battery in roughly minutes 
len ratingthree Really like the concept and ability to do video chats with my team however the echos can be very challenging especially when there are more than people on the call 
len ratingthree When you compare teams on iPad to its office counterparts like word excel and ppt you quickly notice the massive lack of features the iPad version has compared to the desktop and web version of teams 
len ratingthree The UI is not consistent the power of iPad is not leveraged at all 
len ratingthree It does work and on iPad its more like a bigger version of the phone app 
len ratingthree Hopefully MSFT will develop a more powerful ipadOS version akin to the other Office apps 
len ratingthree Until then its clear teams on iPad is simply a phone app scales to the iPad screen 
len ratingfour The one thing I wish it had that other similar apps like Zoom have is a way to preview your video set up before you re actually on a videoconference 
len ratingthree  Sections are too loose 
len ratingthree They need more definition and structure 
len ratingthree Perhaps you need a preface or an introduction 
len ratingthree It s easy to get lost 
len ratingthree Is there a way to drop bread crumbs 
len ratingthree Who took MY nickname 
len ratingfive My company and team used Microsoft Teams for daily communication schedules File Sharing through hard times with the entire IT Team working from home remotely 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft this has to be one of the best collaborative apps period in 
len ratingfour Teams has been a big help 
len ratingfour The teleconference seems to struggle 
len ratingfour But the rest of it is good 
len ratingfive This app works really well and is critical to help our firm work remotely 
len ratingtwo  It s a good application and has many useful options such as calling and private messaging however I would definitely suggest edmodo or google classroom for schools as they are much more efficient and they make a student s work much more easier and organised 
len ratingfive We just implemented Covid teleworking for our team 
len ratingfive We started using MS TEAMS to stay connected 
len ratingfive I think we are closer remotely now than when we were physically together 
len ratingfive Awesome collaboration tool 
len ratingfour Great app
len ratingfive Have been using it qhile work from home during Covid quarantine and it has been great 
len ratingone Using an IPad the set up instruction pushed me back and forth between my phone and IPad with phone number and email 
len ratingone Then it was a continuous sign in loop with no product 
len ratingfour Need much better control over notifications both temporary pausing and syncing delivery with desktop 
len ratingfour Add more icons to quick response 
len ratingfour Need a thumbs down 
len ratingfour Give a higher level of customization to chat 
len ratingfour Would be good to be able to customize the background of a chat or have a different color header that help visualize the sensitivity of a thread 
len ratingone Never works on anything
len ratingfour Needs to be able to show more than participants on video 
len ratingone The reason i used teams was because of how easy it was for me to see my assignments 
len ratingone It is now difficult because I have to go through all my classes and individually click on the class i want to see 
len ratingone Would not recommend because of this 
len ratingfive I find it easier track and respond to multiple chats once a team and channels are set up 
len ratingfive The video conference call with the calendar is great for employees that don t have a camera on their desktop 
len ratingfive Teams software is instrumental in our agencies ability to transition to working from home in this time of emergency 
len ratingfive Microsoft has really got a fantastic tool with Teams 
len ratingthree Unacceptable 
len ratingthree Good interface but without integration to other platforms for other functionality it will only get limited play 
len ratingfive Video chats and the ease to work from your cell phone has really made this app helpful during this time we re WFH 
len ratingone This app is not good guys 
len ratingone First thing it is so buffering in the meeting I m not understanding a thing 
len ratingone I want to tell you something Microsoft don t ever make an agreement with lebanon because there is a lot of crimes happening right now and second thing they don t want to cancel the official exams even though there is people infected with the flu so in conclusion don t be a part of the government in Lebanon 
len ratingone  i hate it
len ratingone Everything is so hard to get too and under so many layers 
len ratingone When I need to use a program especially for something as important as school it needs to be simple and easy to understand 
len ratingone I hate this app
len ratingfive I never thought I would say this teams is a game changer 
len ratingone This application and program has so many parts to it 
len ratingone They all lead somewhere else and you never know where to find the thing your boss or teacher tells you to submit files onto 
len ratingone Hate it
len ratingone This software is a nightmare 
len ratingone Now that it is being used by millions of school children across the country I have experienced major issue 
len ratingone Please do something to curb the increased usage 
len ratingthree The app functions well in terms of video but I could not talk to other people 
len ratingthree I ve used types of headphones AirPods Skullcandy wired headphones and a gaming headset and none of them could pick up my voice 
len ratingfive User friendly so many great features
len ratingfive  It is amazing I can talk to my friends and teachers
len ratingthree Need to be able to have more people show on the video conferences at the same time 
len ratingthree Limited to only with no fix for the longest time now other competitors have been doing for some time now 
len ratingthree Microsoft should lead not follow 
len ratingone CHANGE THE ASSIGNMENTS TAB BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE THE UPDATE
len ratingone This app is giving kids around the world boredom when is comes to the The Corona virus outbreak theses kids should be relaxing and enjoying there freedom bc they are already bored and out of there misery and they should be playing video games and have Quality with there family
len ratingfive Microsoft is a bliss much Love I am introducing this to my university with co workers
len ratingtwo I like the app but it seriously needs a delete button 
len ratingtwo There s no way to delete conversations 
len ratingtwo Not good 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone After downloading app it says it can t open in safari without changing privacy settings for all websites 
len ratingone I thought this was an app not a web version 
len ratingfive With Teams the only limit is time 
len ratingfive Everyday I use this Imlearn a new capability 
len ratingfive Every month a new easier way to enhance my life is uncovered 
len ratingfive Keep it up Microsoft 
len ratingfive Excelente herramienta de trabajo y comunicaci n
len ratingone Due to the current city
len ratingone just very bad needs updates
len ratingtwo Can t do audio video calls using AirPods 
len ratingtwo Seriously 
len ratingtwo It appears as though you ll have choices you ll be needing to buy wired headphones with a mic or you re just going to have to live with your business conversations not being private or having audio issues if you re in a noisy or public space 
len ratingtwo Pretty lame they don t have support for basic communication devices phones and other similar apps have had support for a decade maybe longer 
len ratingfive Great way to respond quickly to team and I like the ability to get on a call quickly 
len ratingfour Overall the app is useful and easy to use but changes should be made to make the phone format more seamless 
len ratingfour The assignment page should not give the option to choose a class or it should give the option to see all classes 
len ratingfour When I touch the notification that pops up on my phone the app takes me to the person I was last talking instead of the person whose message generated the notification 
len ratingfive I ve recently changed from working in an office to working from home and we handle all communication and meetings on Team 
len ratingfive I love it so much and so does everyone else in the office 
len ratingfive  We are a law firm super easy to use fast and efficient 
len ratingfive Group and individual chats and calls keep us in touch 
len ratingfive Having each member of the team as Favorites let s me easily see who is available on a call in a meeting or away from keyboard 
len ratingfive Emoji and GIFs increase the smiling and friendly feel of working together even when we are all remoting in right now because of pandemic 
len ratingfive See subject
len ratingfive Teams allows me to connect with my team no matter where we are in the most efficient way 
len ratingfive Especially during this global pandemic 
len ratingfive Working from home 
len ratingfive Really neat functionality 
len ratingfive Need some method to capture attendance 
len ratingfive Like a check In Feature So meetings arent wasted taking attendance with microphone muted on and off 
len ratingfive Reduce that chaos
len ratingthree Since working at home as using teams I ve enjoyed it for the most part 
len ratingthree However the lag time looks as if I m not responding to management in a timely fashion 
len ratingthree Also hiding messages chats instead of deleting them isn t an option 
len ratingthree The pop ups become a little distracting 
len ratingthree However as a tool to teach virtually it s great 
len ratingone I can t get meet now icon on my Ipad Do have solution for this problem 
len ratingfive Great for being a team player at home 
len ratingfive  covid chronicles
len ratingfive Very friendly user interface very intuitive and great features like adding files on to teams and live editing with the whole team 
len ratingfive Finding it incredible to use
len ratingone  corona not nice for this 
len ratingfive Best for intra team business communications 
len ratingone i wanted to be done but noooo 
len ratingone y all had to find a way
len ratingfive I really love this app
len ratingone Yessir
len ratingfive Only one complaint please leave an option to respect iOS do not disturb settings 
len ratingfive That is all 
len ratingfour We are using Teams for Telepractice to continue to provide services to our families and their children 
len ratingfour It works well overall 
len ratingfour Families with email address find it easy to connect but if your patient doesn t have an email it s not that convenient 
len ratingfour They download the app on their phone and then then the therapist has to text the link to invite them 
len ratingfour Looking forward to the split screen 
len ratingfour It will be great to have this feature available soon 
len ratingfour Thanks Mirlena Sanchez Pronto Therapy
len ratingfour I just got this today because I have to get it for school and so far it s been great 
len ratingfour I can even talk to my friends from school 
len ratingfour Great app that really helps keep communication going when staff is remote 
len ratingfour Could use a little work on the way to do lists are generated 
len ratingfive So glad that my office rolled out Teams prior to the COVID home lockdowns 
len ratingfive It is a wonderful tool for keeping remote teams in touch 
len ratingfive And it s powerful too we ve had Team video meetings with participants used the share screen feature and the video and audio streams were flawless 
len ratingfive Create channels for everything you work on 
len ratingfive You ll be amazed by how connected your office can be while locked away in our separate homes 
len ratingfive Using this application is like using two monitors for the first time you ll never be able to go back to how you were working before 
len ratingthree With the new Teams update March the notifications preview on lock screen doesn t seem to work 
len ratingthree It always says You have notifications 
len ratingthree I have to open the Teams app to read the notification now 
len ratingthree Earlier I was able to read the notifications directly from lock screen 
len ratingtwo I m am writing this review in hopes that it will be seen and changes made now when it is needed most rather than in a year when it is not 
len ratingtwo I am one of the many users who is using this app as a way to communicate with the teacher at my school 
len ratingtwo The biggest problem I have found is the fact that there is no way to view all your assignments at once 
len ratingtwo Instead you must such through many layers until you find it and that s for each class I know this used to be a feature and I can not for the life of me understand why it was removed 
len ratingtwo My preferred solution to this would be a button that allows you add to calendar your assignment and it would automatically go to the due date with a reminder 
len ratingtwo However if this not doable then a simple view assignment list would work so long as they were presented in the due soonest to latest format 
len ratingfour I would like a badge on the corner of the teams tab indicating a post was made 
len ratingone I am trying to add a second team on my mobile devices and laptop 
len ratingone I originally have one for school and am now trying to add one for work 
len ratingone When l try l get an l m sorry something went wrong message 
len ratingone One star only because it works for one team 
len ratingone This app just crashes on my iPhone 
len ratingone Worthless for now unless they fix it 
len ratingone  It usually cannot start just displaying a big logo 
len ratingone You cannot switch back to the app without killing it 
len ratingone In video conference you cannot see shared screen 
len ratingone In such time Microsoft should really check the quality of its apps 
len ratingfive It bad that what l whant to say
len ratingone Have installed deleted reinstalled several times wont get past the home screen of required passcode 
len ratingone Shuts off when I click ok 
len ratingone  Wiki is not searchable 
len ratingone File types not supported 
len ratingone Single window on desktop app prevents multitasking 
len ratingtwo C mon Microsoft 
len ratingtwo Add an option for all trillion of us Teams users to turn OFF the incessant notification sounds when I receive a message while I m on video calls with my Fortune clients 
len ratingtwo It s an option in Outlook s preferences so why not Teams 
len ratingtwo It s so distracting and I m sure clients find it disrespectful 
len ratingtwo Will give stars when this option materializes 
len ratingone This app is very disorganized and not at all helpful for students or teachers 
len ratingone The interface is not user friendly whatsoever and video conference attempts are chaotic and dysfunctional 
len ratingone Do not recommend getting 
len ratingone Also this app crashes a lot 
len ratingone Try Google Classroom instead if you really want something flexible that works 
len ratingone This app caused me emotional pain and further added to the pain that my senior year is ruined ripclass googleisfresh
len ratingone Y all already know the play 
len ratingone G O O D B Y E
len ratingone That s about all I have to say about that
len ratingone  Not for schools 
len ratingone It s didn t send me all the notifications I need
len ratingfive This is the best I can be in communication without making calls and share information so easy
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingone  I don t want homework
len ratingone Yep
len ratingfive This tool is a seamless way to connect with your associates in both text video and meetings 
len ratingfive Go Microsoft 
len ratingone App doesn t work with Microsoft s own Authenticator App 
len ratingone I also see no way to remove old accounts from the app
len ratingfive I really really like everything about this app I like how you can send pics do the GIF s 
len ratingfive Video make a call etc 
len ratingfive add people delete people make groups and on and on 
len ratingfive Super cool 
len ratingfive Awesome app to collaborate with multiple teams 
len ratingfour I was a big user of Skype still reprogramming my click reflexes but the file attachment option is certainly nice
len ratingfive This is the very first time I ve downloaded this app 
len ratingfive This is an amazing app to chat and call with your personal or professional people and also it s so cool to have emojis and all the sharing features on this app in case to share files and pictures and many more 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive We transitioned from using Skype to using teams 
len ratingfive The possibilities of this are endless 
len ratingfive We can make conference calls easily message without complications 
len ratingfive It s a much better app than what it was when we first transitioned I absolutely love it 
len ratingfive Perfect for a temp PPerfect
len ratingfour Great
len ratingone bad
len ratingfive Does everything the PC App does 
len ratingfive Great app and highly recommend 
len ratingone  this app is slow and gives a terrible experience
len ratingone It s not working on my IPad 
len ratingone I don t know why 
len ratingone I tried to uninstall it and install it back 
len ratingone But it s the same 
len ratingfour Great app 
len ratingfour Meetings and outlook cal are confusing 
len ratingfour Also there is no way to open more than one team window at a time 
len ratingfour Should be able to see if someone is mobile or pc bound 
len ratingfive I am working from home to stop spread corona worldwide 
len ratingfive I never feel that I am working without team Microsoft Teams possible this 
len ratingfive Thanks Teams 
len ratingfive You are really amazing Nosherwan Qalabdar
len ratingone If I could give zero stars I would this app doesn t work at all 
len ratingone It will not allow me to sign in even though I am putting in the right password 
len ratingone Complete crap Microsoft you should be ashamed 
len ratingfive Love the app and incorporating it with my desktop application 
len ratingfive The fact you can set up notifications to only show if not online with the device and can silence alarms when not at work is awesome 
len ratingfive I have a few complaints with the desktop app like not allowing multiple instances but this review is not about that so Stars for the iTunes App 
len ratingfive I just can believe how teams has changed my life 
len ratingfive How on earth did we get by without it 
len ratingfive Teams is like bread and water and beer to me 
len ratingone Teams made Skype for Business a very simple streamlined and seamless communication tool convoluted 
len ratingone Tons of features no one asked for 
len ratingone Put it in the trash 
len ratingfive It is awesome 
len ratingone I love this app it s been great with everyone working in remote locations 
len ratingone However since updating to the latest version this morning it no longer works 
len ratingone See title 
len ratingone Please help 
len ratingone  Can y all please my account i no longer needs it Thank you
len ratingfour  longer feeds will not keep words together by moving the characters to the next line but split them when the character limit for the line is reached 
len ratingfour Otherwise this app has been great wish we started using it sooner 
len ratingone Unlike Skype for Business Teams does not let users choose their presence privacy 
len ratingone This is very annoying and leads to unnecessary supervision as well through the tool 
len ratingone  On PC I can join thru meeting using a link without sign in 
len ratingone Whereas on iPad I can t join without sign in 
len ratingone Sign in only allows school or work account 
len ratingone if I login thru my work account I can t join meeting from different org thru link 
len ratingfour Needs better notifications for incoming chats 
len ratingone I just want to make a free Microsoft Account to experience the full world of Minecraft but it say I have to download this app and now I don t know what to do
len ratingfive Very dynamic and versatile
len ratingthree Would like a lot more inservicing from someone on functionality or teams 
len ratingthree We started using it and everyone in my region not sure how it works 
len ratingone Very bad app makes my life miserable
len ratingone Corona ain t helping 
len ratingfive Microsoft hit it out the park with teams 
len ratingfive Love teams 
len ratingone corona virus
len ratingfour It won t send notifications even though I put them on 
len ratingfour Enabling drawing during conference would be great 
len ratingfour Otherwise still need to use another video conference app
len ratingthree  There s many major user experience and design flaws in the desktop version of this application including file viewing uploading downloading related activities and especially the search tool 
len ratingthree The mobile app on iOS seems to avoid all those issues 
len ratingthree But sadly because my company is under Microsoft umbrella I have no choice but only to use this app 
len ratingthree Please take user experience of Teams application seriously since many business has to use Microsoft softwares 
len ratingfour I like the app 
len ratingfour The quality is beautiful 
len ratingfour I just don t like how we can t delete stuff on this app 
len ratingfour If we could delete things then maybe I ll give this app stars 
len ratingfour I have a quick question 
len ratingfour My school uses Teams for schoolwork 
len ratingfour If I post a link from my assignment to the one my teacher posted on the assignments tab would the rest of the class be able to see it 
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingfive In this moment of forced telework Teams is changing how we collaborate 
len ratingtwo  don t get me wrong this app is great 
len ratingtwo just through teams we re using it for online school right now which is great and super easy 
len ratingtwo but PLEASE change the assignments tabs back 
len ratingtwo now you have to pick a class to see if you have assignments for and if you want to check if you have any assignments you have to go through and click each class which is really annoying and i keep missing assignments 
len ratingtwo it used to be that all your assignments for every class were just on that screen and that was so much more user friendly i ll change my rating if this is changed back because this really is a good app but the new assignments tab is really annoying and is making me hate teams thank you for your time
len ratingfive Teams has been so wonderful to use and keep track of all we are doing as an organization to meet the need in our community during this time 
len ratingfive I have never been more informed and well connected as I am now with our staff and it s due to Teams 
len ratingfive It s easy to use explain and share information on Teams 
len ratingfive Thanks for making this time easy with one less thing to try and figure out 
len ratingfive Great to stay in touch instantly when your mobile 
len ratingfive The only thing that could change is the way you have to search on how to display a specific screen if you have more than one 
len ratingone  I hate online school
len ratingone Very bad view of the chats not very fast 
len ratingfive We love it 
len ratingone System is too confusing and difficult on mobile wouldn t recommend
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive Has all functionality
len ratingfive  Excellent collaboration tool
len ratingthree My only negative feedback is the fact that I cannot customize notifications on desktop vs mobile 
len ratingthree I m having to delete the teams app for periods of time or mute entire channels just so my phone doesn t blow up 
len ratingthree It would be great if the alerts could be customized for my mobile app differently than the desktop app 
len ratingfive Easy to use and great way to keep in touch 
len ratingtwo One on one is not as good as a team being all on at the same time 
len ratingtwo No problems as a group in an iPad 
len ratingtwo One on one in a cell phone is either the screen freezes or cuts out or you can t hear 
len ratingtwo That part needs a lot of help 
len ratingfive I LOVE TEAMS and how it integrates with Word and Excel so well 
len ratingfive Great job Microsoft 
len ratingfive Your software and apps are blessing many many lives especially during this Coronavirus time when so many people need to work and communicate from home 
len ratingfive Blessing lives is what software should do and you have totally done it 
len ratingfive I honestly feel our world wouldn t progress and deal with challenges as well without Microsoft software 
len ratingfive It helps and enhances our lives in so many ways 
len ratingfive  Thank you for Teams 
len ratingfive No germ
len ratingone I am not sure why Microsoft teams is such a very poor setup for first time logins 
len ratingone We have employees I wanted to switch over but I will stick to google hangouts until Microsoft makes it more intuitive to sign up 
len ratingone Very bad experience 
len ratingone Such a let down as it looks promising 
len ratingone But if tech savvy users are having trouble signing up or even getting logged in then I really don t have a need for this 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone That login was gross why not just login from app why login external links 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams has been very helpful 
len ratingfive Our sales office has been able to stay home and not touch each other successfully 
len ratingone  It lets teachers give us homework
len ratingfour Everything on the app seems to work very well except I don t receive notifications at times 
len ratingfour I always have my phone s software as well as the app updated at all times but I don t always receive the notifications for when I receive a message 
len ratingone this is a bad site app
len ratingfive H ng c c em h c sinh kh c v o rate sao appstore xo app 
len ratingone  i have been using this in school and it horrible i hate it i can t understand what s going on or hear anyone this app is overall bad
len ratingone Very bad application and is use less and is a waste of time and it made my phone slower over all I would not recommend it
len ratingthree Before the recent update it was an overall easy app to use 
len ratingthree Sometimes the app crashed but it was pretty isolated 
len ratingthree Before the update we were able to view our assignments from all of our classes in one place however with the new update we have to select a class and we are only able to view assignments from that one class 
len ratingthree This is a big inconvenience and created difficulty for many and make sit much easier to miss out on assignments especially as online learning has now started due to the coronavirus 
len ratingthree It wastes a lot of our time having to filter through all classes and it makes it much easier to miss out on assignments 
len ratingthree Please take action on this as soon as possible it is much more efficient to organise and plan out your day with online learning and homework when all assignments are shown in one place 
len ratingfour Task management needs improvement 
len ratingfour Need to be able to access it on my phone 
len ratingone I downloaded the app so I could easily upload files to a teams folder from my phone couldn t do that fail 
len ratingone Fatal feature gap 
len ratingone Even while the app is closed messages come through 
len ratingone Intrusive 
len ratingfive Microsoft has outdone itself 
len ratingfive Seem less smooth connection dependent but dependable and if utilized well very reliable communication meeting tool 
len ratingtwo I have wifi but no phone signal 
len ratingtwo You are requiring me to take a phone call or put in a code that you will text me 
len ratingtwo So I am locked out 
len ratingfive Love the app as much as I like the actual program 
len ratingfive Very well translated on the iOS platform intuitive 
len ratingfive I m a big fan of this one 
len ratingthree Dear god the volume while making a call and waiting for the other person to join is so loud and I cannot see anywhere where it is possible to lower the volume 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingthree Otherwise the app is fairly good 
len ratingfive This is such a great way to connect with our team access necessary files have meetings on the go 
len ratingfive What an awesome tool to keep things going during this trying time 
len ratingfive It is amazing 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Everyone should use TEAMS 
len ratingfour Need this feature
len ratingfive What you would expect 
len ratingfive We use it for work 
len ratingone Eeee
len ratingfive I never thought I say this about a Microsoft product but teams mobile version is better than slacks version at lease when it comes to user experience 
len ratingfive Well it s another day that starts and ends with teams 
len ratingfive Virtual meetings with customers partners and employees in over countries 
len ratingfive Seamless integration and an exceptional customer experience 
len ratingfive Engineering reviews and source code walk throughs to align our product roadmap 
len ratingfive Next up our virtual happy hour and cloud cafe 
len ratingfive Who said you can t make working remotely fun and productive at the same time 
len ratingfour This is a great app 
len ratingfour I wish I could use multiple profiles 
len ratingfour I have several Microsoft accounts and it would be great if I could use all of them on the app 
len ratingfour Right now you have to sign off of one and login to the other to check messages 
len ratingfive Very nice and intuitive 
len ratingfive User A 
len ratingfive This program has proven invaluable to my organization 
len ratingfive I use this for all my school stuff with my teachers friends over the Corona virus 
len ratingfive Even tho I m only in th grade this is very helpful to me 
len ratingfive Amen and God bless u 
len ratingfive This app is surprisingly good 
len ratingfive I m able to connect with my teammates via video phone and chat on real time 
len ratingfive Clean interface 
len ratingfive Able to send attachments for review and comment 
len ratingfive My only recommendation is that the status of each team member is wildly inaccurate 
len ratingfive  Will be chatting with a member and app says she s offline 
len ratingfive Better than Skype and owned by the same company 
len ratingone  This app is worthless
len ratingfive Very impressive tool 
len ratingfive Very well coded app 
len ratingfive The things I can do on the desktop can translate to the app 
len ratingfive Keeps me engaged and know what our people are doing at my fingertips 
len ratingone I can t use this app because it exposes personal information with no clear way to disable it 
len ratingone Even if I delete the app and reinstall it it still prompts me to sign in with my personal email address which it has stored somewhere or is otherwise tracking me with 
len ratingone This is crossing a line and I cannot accept it 
len ratingone I should be able to have this app forget me and for it to have my personal information required for authenticating only while I m using the app 
len ratingone A person who steals my phone and gains access to it should not be displayed my personal email address 
len ratingone My only complaint but it is a complete deal breaker 
len ratingone I m an office subscriber and the process to set up my account for teams using the iOS app gets stuck it confirms that I have an account asks me to sign in then just stops and won t allow me to sign in 
len ratingfive It keep me posted on everything 
len ratingfour I would give it a star review if it allowed more than people on screen at one time 
len ratingfour Pick it up Microsoft Zoom is coming for ya 
len ratingfour Still showing some break down of sound during the calls 
len ratingfour Otherwise a great app 
len ratingone  This app literally never works ever 
len ratingone It always has a problem
len ratingone  My teacher made me download this because of covid the app is great tho
len ratingfour  It s great for turning in school work of course and is allowing my school to do everything online but the update was just very unfortunate 
len ratingfour The whole benefit of clicking on the Assignments tab is gone now because you have to choose a class instead of the app just listing them all in order for you 
len ratingfour Teams is much better than Skype for Business but there could be some improvements 
len ratingfour Initiating whiteboards from the iPad app would be great 
len ratingfour I also wish you could configure it to come up on a tab other than activity I find myself rarely using that tab at all 
len ratingone i am experiencing multiple issues in connecting to a conferance it s been three conferances in a row that i can t connect to them 
len ratingtwo The font size is so tiny as if a non retina font is rendered on a retina display 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive Teams works very well each time I use 
len ratingtwo I have high hops for the shifts app but it looks like things are not kicking over from desk top to app 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingfour teams II like teams are
len ratingfive Teams app is user friendly and a great way to stay in touch with your team 
len ratingfive Especially now during this trying time with the country 
len ratingfive Keep organized make teams store your files share content all in one spot and chat 
len ratingfive Gone away are emails 
len ratingfive So very thankful we have already rolled out this technology at our company 
len ratingfive It has been a great tool during these unprecedented times 
len ratingfive Technology worked well simple to navigate 
len ratingtwo A bit clunky to use 
len ratingtwo Not as intuitive as Skype 
len ratingtwo Please add Skype type of plugin to enhance personalization or makt this one more user friendly 
len ratingfive Perfect for team collaboration
len ratingtwo My first impression should have been based on the App as a whole but sadly I couldn t log in an error keeps poppin up what am I doing wrong
len ratingone Rlly making us do online homework
len ratingone I was just not feeling it 
len ratingfour The desktop version is perfect 
len ratingfour Still a bit to go in the mobile app 
len ratingfour Even as I type my cursor is moving but I can t see the words just all white background 
len ratingone  Just bad
len ratingone It s annoying when teachers use this app
len ratingone  I just don t like it
len ratingone It s not very good
len ratingone Not it
len ratingfive Easy to use and reliable
len ratingfive Pretty impressive application I really appreciate the Microsoft Team work 
len ratingfive Thank You there is so much to learn my lifetime is not going to be enough where is the fountain of youth apps ha 
len ratingfive Ha 
len ratingfive  keep up the good work 
len ratingfive  You are looking for ideas 
len ratingone It constantly crashes and doesn t work 
len ratingone  Only app review I ve ever done 
len ratingone This app is garbage lbs of shit in a lb bag 
len ratingfour Wref
len ratingthree  Any reason why whiteboard doesn t show up when on a call 
len ratingthree Tried with or more people per the docs 
len ratingthree Even though the change log from April mentions whiteboard support it s not an option 
len ratingone  THIS APPPUS GAYY DONT DUNMWON 
len ratingone NFKK OLEASE RATE str to delete from appppoe stor
len ratingfive  This is a great application and is setting the pace for the rest of the industry 
len ratingfive While it has some small flaws this is an exceptional tool for business 
len ratingfive With the ability to record and translate in languages in real time the amount of integrations and inclusion of Microsoft Whiteboard makes this one of the most useful tools on the market 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingone It doesn t really work unless you re at school or in the office where there s a lot of high speed internet WiFi 
len ratingone really bad app very confusing and poorly manufactured so disppointing
len ratingone i hate it
len ratingone  air
len ratingone Terrible application very unorganized I recommend googleclassroom 
len ratingone This app is terrible
len ratingone This is terrible nothing is working
len ratingone  Awful not worth buying
len ratingone No
len ratingfive We can not access our environment without connecting to the VPN for daily work so authenticating to Azure to even get communication with Teams through my phone is very convenient 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive It is smooth responsive and well thought out 
len ratingfive I can work on a document and save it to OneDrive in the interim for when I get to our on prem environment 
len ratingfive I really like this convenience 
len ratingfive Teams is one of those software platforms that breaks the mold and changes the game 
len ratingfive With the realities of our ever changing world requiring new avenues of communication Team is the tool that makes those changes easy to transverse 
len ratingfour Awesome app uses a lot of Resources 
len ratingfive They responded quicjly
len ratingfive This app has helped with productivity and accountability within our work group immensely 
len ratingthree Whenever i use Teams on iPad to make a conference call there is always significant dropout connection issues maybe about of the entire call would be bad 
len ratingthree But when I do the same calls with the same people on MacBook it never happens always good on the same days 
len ratingthree Please fix that 
len ratingtwo Look I m not tech savvy but you would think Microsoft would be able to make a team communication app that could let you view picture and video without downloading the entire file to your phone first 
len ratingtwo Groupme is free and can get the basics down right 
len ratingtwo Just get back to basics and fix communication first and then people will want to play with your cool add ons and stuff 
len ratingfive My
len ratingfive I love all the features calls messaging reading docs 
len ratingfive It has great functionality and the quality of the video calls are awesome 
len ratingfive Way better than Skype 
len ratingfive Teams is an amazing app I really like it
len ratingfive Does a great job of carrying the experience from my computer to my phone 
len ratingone How it is even possible that this app does not support airpods 
len ratingone This is so lame 
len ratingfive We used to utilize Skype before Teams came out 
len ratingfive Skype would lose the conversation and if you needed to refer back to it you had to review your conversation section in outlook tedious 
len ratingfive Teams is much better 
len ratingfive Especially the file sharing for projects we are all working on 
len ratingthree Needs improvements
len ratingfive My work is done completely remote thanks to using Teams 
len ratingfive This app is almost seamless letting my employees share their screens and the display is perfect on my phone 
len ratingfive Highly recommend
len ratingone Teams is so annoying 
len ratingone Google classroom is so much better 
len ratingone Terrible integration awful interface and no intuitive navigation 
len ratingone I love teams but I ve been really frustrated with it lately 
len ratingone I have an iPhone on the most up to date software and the app crashes every time I try to open it 
len ratingone For an app that s supposed to be work based I ve been hindered from staying connected 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive Dear Microsoft Team Hope this email finds you well 
len ratingfive I m facing a trouble in sign in from my mobile the account it works from my Pc but it s work on the phone 
len ratingfive Please could you help to face this matter 
len ratingfive Thanks Sara
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Bravo Microsoft 
len ratingfour We use teams in our office to share screens with people calling from the outside 
len ratingfour We typically have sound issues whether the sound comes from the laptop or with videos being played 
len ratingfour Also if people are in the same room people outside may hear an echo 
len ratingfive The Teams app is very user friendly and helpful for all the needs of my current role within the company 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfour Teams is much better than Skype but even with a strong signal can sometimes sound robotic
len ratingfour This is an essential tool for me and I d love watch support for chats and groups 
len ratingfive This thing is amazing
len ratingtwo It s not refreshing and some times shoes the status of last time when I used it only when I open the individual chat then the status is getting updated like available busy do not disturb n so on it give a wrong feed towards the end pl check
len ratingone I don t get any notification sounds 
len ratingone Just a pop up and it easily goes unnoticed 
len ratingone It s set to persistent but the pop up goes away after one second 
len ratingone I need the notifications sounds or this app is useless 
len ratingone I can t just stare at my iPhone all day waiting for messages 
len ratingone  Hello Apple Snackle we are sorry the inconvenience this problem caused 
len ratingone It will be fixed with the next app update 
len ratingone Stay tuned 
len ratingone I have the iPhone XS Max and this is the only app I have that runs and lags very badly 
len ratingone Touch response is seconds for anything I am trying to do 
len ratingone I can t use the chat feature because I have to wait seconds when I am typing a message quickly for it to register my keyboard hits 
len ratingone I ve searched and searched for a resolution with no luck 
len ratingone Unfortunate because it seems like a promising tool 
len ratingone Excited to try this app but when I try to login to the free version I get in to a loop of buttons and windows between the browser and the app saying that I m in but I m not and I get stuck in to the loop of signing in againNo one seems to know what s going on 
len ratingtwo I signed into the app once and it worked fine 
len ratingtwo I started getting calls and messages from colleagues overseas at all hours of the night so I signed out so it wouldn t show me as available 
len ratingtwo When I try to sign back in it keeps giving me an error saying the app can t connect to the internet 
len ratingtwo This happened on both my phone and iPad 
len ratingtwo This serious bug is making the app unusable now even after deleting and re downloading 
len ratingfive Helps a lot to doing my job
len ratingfive I ve used slack and tbh it only gives a partial experience 
len ratingfive I would probably go with discord before slack and maybe even chime 
len ratingfive Teams hand down is the best for personal and business use 
len ratingfive Great tool 
len ratingfive Ties into AD office and conference lines 
len ratingfive Dropped GoToMeeting and RongCentral 
len ratingfive Video chat crashes when you get over people in a single video chat 
len ratingfive  Hey KESHAVL can you shoot as an email so we can troubleshoot this with you 
len ratingfour The Teams platform is really great if you can stay tethered to a desk or the device you re on 
len ratingfour Would be great if users can hot switch devices mid call from desktop to mobile app and vice versa 
len ratingfour Many soft phones do this already and have for a long time 
len ratingfour Sometimes I ll be into something and then have to go do an action away from my desk and have to put the call down making communication less efficient and causing multiple trips 
len ratingfour Screen share file share video group calls and messaging integrations all great 
len ratingfour Good but hard to toggle between files screens 
len ratingfive Very convenient
len ratingfive Powerful and easy to use 
len ratingfive R t tuy t th t s r t tuy t
len ratingtwo Tons of limitations from required desktop use to invoking paid services for most of experience
len ratingthree Stop playin
len ratingtwo Feels a bit sloppy for a business application seems like it will get better until then it s 
len ratingfive I am a fan of this app it really makes life easier specially that all files we share are saved on Sharepoint and we can access them anytime and anywhere 
len ratingfive Creating a teams site for each team you have record your calls and save them and many other awesome features 
len ratingfive Every company should have Microsoft Teams I really recommend it 
len ratingfour Teams has been great for me as a work at home employee 
len ratingfour However the online version has a group of Microsoft programs in a upper left group such as outlook PowerPoint and other Microsoft grouping 
len ratingfour The Desktop doesn t have at least outlook which is one of our major programs 
len ratingfour This causes me to open the online version so I Use online versus Desktop 
len ratingfour I really like the application and how useful it is on all platforms 
len ratingfour Perhaps it s a picky item but I d eventually like to see dark mode adapt the settings of the device it s installed within 
len ratingfour Right now the toggle is just fine however several other applications utilize the auto functionality to adapt the user settings of the device instead of a manual toggle 
len ratingfour Love the app though 
len ratingfive Microsoft needs teams to have the functionally of outlook but in chat form here 
len ratingfive They need to add the function to hyperlink file paths 
len ratingfive It s a critical function 
len ratingone I have to use this app for work and it nearly instant crashes on my iPhone 
len ratingone I assume it is inefficient and uses too much memory 
len ratingone It is unusable even after clearing app data and cache and reinstalling 
len ratingfive everything else is good except that eats up all my system resources
len ratingfive Works great could be more like the pc website though 
len ratingfive As a Program Administrator the use of this tool allows me to acquire much needed data from our Service Assurance Agents 
len ratingone  This app does not respect the quiet hours you set in the app 
len ratingone I still get phone calls and messages during quiet time 
len ratingone It has even bypasses my phone wide settings for Do Not Disturb 
len ratingone EXTREMELY annoying 
len ratingone Fix it now 
len ratingone While broadcasting your screen launch Angry Birds 
len ratingone It will crash 
len ratingone Won t vibrate when a notification comes in and won t even make a noise either this happens When the phone is unlocked or locked 
len ratingone I have missed tons of IMs Bc The notifications are not working 
len ratingone When they used to before the update 
len ratingone I just see tons of notifications on my locked screen when I take a look at my phone and yes I have everything turn on as it should I get all my notifications for outlook texts everything besides teams 
len ratingone And looking at the other review I m not the only one 
len ratingone Please fix it s been over weeks to fix this bug and it s one of the most important things you need on a app 
len ratingone To get notifications 
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingthree Your app isn t giving information whatsoever on why its kicking me out of my organization when I have already been signed in on my other phone
len ratingone This app stinks 
len ratingone Not user friendly
len ratingfive I find it works rather well and is intuitive enough that little training is needed and the phone app the windows desktop app and the browser app work about the same or close enough 
len ratingfour Audio didn t work during a call last week Also the editing with each other doesn t work
len ratingthree Need quick toggle for dual login support for multiple team subscribers
len ratingone I used to love this app and used it all the time for work 
len ratingone However since the most recent update I receive no notifications at all 
len ratingone No banners sounds or vibrations 
len ratingone Now I have to remember to open the app several times a day to see if I get a chat or teams alert 
len ratingone  weeks with a big like this is unheard of 
len ratingfive Awesomely Good
len ratingfive Just needs connectivity issues solved
len ratingfive I ve become a huge believer with great appreciation for what Teams brings to our team 
len ratingfive Kudos to Teams 
len ratingone For myself and a every other iOS user I ve asked in my company update caused notifications to no longer make a sound or vibrate 
len ratingone The screen comes on and I get a banner notification but nothing else 
len ratingone  weeks is a long time to leave a bug like this 
len ratingfive Strictly for the business professional
len ratingthree It has too many things 
len ratingthree It would be good if it is simplified further
len ratingtwo It wouldn t let me sign in
len ratingfive This app improves my ability to collaborate with my team as well as with other groups and it saves me time 
len ratingfive Email and phone
len ratingfive I am a Teams fan after using the product for months 
len ratingfive It took some time to learn the features 
len ratingfive What I love is the ability to seamlessly integrate content from Outlook gt SharePoint gt Teams on both Windows and iOS 
len ratingfive That is sweet 
len ratingfive Teams allows you to think about how you manage the knowledge being created in a whole new way 
len ratingfive I have my own channel for my personal items 
len ratingfive But most of my work is joint so we have shared channels with document control 
len ratingfive I also love knowing that if we do a good job documenting a project that we will live a good footprint for the future 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Teams saves me so much time
len ratingone How do you create a suite of dozens of apps and force users to log in to EVERY FREAKING ONE OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY and restart EVERY FREAKING APP simply because I changed the privacy settings in one of them 
len ratingone For crying out loud create a common login and common settings for privacy and others others that work across apps 
len ratingone This goes beyond even Microsoft s legendary idiocy 
len ratingone  Literally every week there is a new issue revolving around Notifications 
len ratingone This week I no longer receive any sound when I get a message 
len ratingone How is the most important aspect of this app constantly having issues every week 
len ratingfive Faster than the speed of thought
len ratingthree I have to delete the app almost every day and re download for it to load messages etc 
len ratingthree works great when it does work but it s inconsistent 
len ratingfive This is one of the really great app where it connects all the employee s from all over the world in single place and help us collaborate each other
len ratingfive Very efficient and rasy to use and has similar features as the web app which makea easy to use the teams chat
len ratingfour It uses the standard iOS alert same as other apps can t tell the difference
len ratingfive I use it with my work teams
len ratingfive We use this app and it helps stay informed with communication as a team in the district 
len ratingfive We communicate with information just for the group of people on the teams that have been selected 
len ratingfive It allows us to have quick conference calls and meetings 
len ratingfive Have private information shared and communicated 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingtwo Notifications options have been removed from the iPhone Settings for Teams with the latest version 
len ratingtwo The Teams apps takes you to Settings gt Teams but there is no option for notifications just Contacts Photos Camera etc 
len ratingtwo This greatly diminishes the usefulness of the app 
len ratingtwo  Hello sorry to hear that you are experiencing this 
len ratingtwo This is a known issue with the iOS platform 
len ratingtwo Uninstalling and re installing the app should resolve the problem 
len ratingfive Works great with my phone and seamless relationship with my computer at work 
len ratingfive Question Is the file portion not on the phone app or am I just missing it 
len ratingfive Add a built in survey tool in Teams 
len ratingfive Allow chat threads to be deleted
len ratingfive It a good way to allow everyone to see and keep up with what s happening we also can rely on it for memory of situation 
len ratingfive Love the flexibility to work from anywhere 
len ratingfive My best source of communication with company employees 
len ratingfive It s convenient and easy to connect with colleagues 
len ratingfive I love the integrations 
len ratingfive We switched from Slack earlier this month and feel like we are more productive with Microsoft teams 
len ratingthree Teams is good but doesn t have nearly the level of functionality that you can find in Slack 
len ratingthree It gets the job done though 
len ratingfive I use this to chat with friends in class all the time 
len ratingfour Jtskt
len ratingone Working with tasks is bad experience in Teams iPadOS App iPad Pro 
len ratingone Frames often do not fit the screen and extend beyond it and there s no way to scroll 
len ratingone When you try to scroll down it just flickers and returns immediately into the same position 
len ratingone Opening dropdown menus is pain it flickers and works out of times 
len ratingone It feels like it s an alpha version or something 
len ratingone It s a really bad surprise to get such poorly functioning interface from Microsoft 
len ratingfive The seamlessness with Teams is paramount 
len ratingfive Teams has made day to day collaboration and communication far easier easier in so many aspect 
len ratingfive Very highly recommended 
len ratingfive Provides excellent convenience to get in touch of people worldwide
len ratingfive Really makes our group more productive 
len ratingtwo There is no way to turn on notifications in iPad iOS 
len ratingtwo You have to open the app to see if you have a new message 
len ratingfour We moved from Slack to Teams and live it 
len ratingfour The only complaint I would have you cannot send a note to yourself 
len ratingfive Teams gt gt skype
len ratingfive We used more and more 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfive Calls are better than Skype 
len ratingone  It s not bad I just don t like when we have to do it on school so sry
len ratingthree If I want to take call from mobile and sharing on desktop it is not working while it was used to work on other products like skype 
len ratingfour The account switching performance as well as general usage was awful on my S 
len ratingfour It was until I upgraded to an iPhone Pro that the app became usable 
len ratingfour Mobile experience overall is responsive and quick but I hope the dev team is hyper focused on minimising bloat as Teams is heavy on battery as my firm s key collaboration app 
len ratingthree I ve been using teams as a teacher for over a year and the improvements are showing 
len ratingthree At first it was so hard to use that it wasn t worth it for the average teacher 
len ratingthree As the interface has gotten more user friendly more and more of my colleagues are using teams in the classroom 
len ratingthree I d love to be able to search assignments instead of just filtering by tags 
len ratingthree Opening PDFs in adobe instead of downloading or in a browser would be nice too 
len ratingfour Good app so far 
len ratingfour Please keep developing and adding new features to make it GREAT 
len ratingfive Our company was using Zoom and recently switched to Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive This is so much better I can t even begin to tell you all the ways 
len ratingfive File sharing chat calling conferencing etc 
len ratingfive all are great and good quality even in poor situations like airport wifi 
len ratingtwo Having used multiple conference online meeting applications there are several items that have made Teams not the easiest to use 
len ratingtwo Several clients have had trouble logging in and easily using the application can always say why I just relay their feedback 
len ratingtwo I also want to add new participants on the fly to calls meetings by adding their emails but they re not accepted if they are not recognized If using regularly for internal teams I m sure it ll run better but for external sales and presentations to new prospects it doesn t run as smooth as I require 
len ratingtwo Several times when trying to launch conferences calls thru the Teams apps participants couldn t hear me 
len ratingtwo So then I had to dial in outside of the app but that created issues since I had already logged in online 
len ratingtwo It would also be helpful to be able to have a static conference ID for our business so I can use it regularly rather than having to schedule each call and use unique call meeting log ins 
len ratingtwo We use Teams as it s part of the MS applications and we want to keep everything under one umbrella but there are improvements that would help to put it on par with other conferencing online meeting applications 
len ratingfour Typing communications works well 
len ratingfour Talking over and having meetings over Teams is buggy at times 
len ratingfive Very user friendly 
len ratingfive Definitely helps if you are constantly on the move 
len ratingfive This is first Software that Microsoft has developed that we use every day 
len ratingfive Microsoft now let s bring the Push to Talk to Microsoft Team ASAP 
len ratingfive The emails are gone away with Team App now Phone Calls will go away with Team Push to Talk 
len ratingthree Need this feature badly with filter functionality 
len ratingtwo  during video calls if you re on your phone even with the preview where you look normal to everyone else your face will be huge and up close 
len ratingtwo Please let the view from my phone truly reflect what other people see I looked like a big moron 
len ratingfour I think this is a great app overall but for some reason it s sporadic with giving me notifications 
len ratingfour I have my settings correct and I ve researched the issue 
len ratingfour It s a pretty important feature and would certainly fetch a fifth star from me if it were consistently reliable with notifying me 
len ratingfive This app is absolutely seamless 
len ratingfive The Microsoft team really knocked it out of the park 
len ratingfive The functionality offered to me on my cell is of the highest quality exactly the same as my laptop 
len ratingfive It s an app I m not annoyed to use for work I actually get excited to use it 
len ratingthree Everything else is fine
len ratingfive best teams team ever 
len ratingfive Gives me all of the functionality to stay connected when I m not at my desk 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingone It works great on the iPhone and on a laptop but the iPad app does not allow for joining Team meetings 
len ratingone Clicking on the meeting link should open the meeting in the iPad app as it does on the iPhone but instead it routes to Safari which wants to download a package for laptop application not for iPad 
len ratingone It s an endless loop rendering iPad Teams useless 
len ratingone Please fix asap to work as it does on iPhone 
len ratingfive Teams provided an excellent means via which our team no pun intended can stay in touch and on top of your projects and deadlines 
len ratingfive Ditching everything else 
len ratingfive Great way to keep your teams updated and organized 
len ratingfive No communication issues anymore 
len ratingfive Teams has simplified and made communications more time efficient 
len ratingfive Great tool for tracking project progress and sharing files while creating a thumbprint for documentation 
len ratingfive This has helped our office communication so much 
len ratingfive Real time and secure 
len ratingone  Won t vibrate when I notification comes in and won t even make a noise either When the phone is unlocked or locked 
len ratingone I have missed tons of IMs Bc I didn t get notifications are not working 
len ratingone I just see tons of notifications on my locked screen when I take a look at my phone and yes I have everything turn on as it should I get all my notifications for outlook texts everything besides teams 
len ratingone And looking at the other review I m not the only one 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingfive The platform allows for an easy solution to overwhelming email threads while maintaining a professional communication mechanism 
len ratingone Currently useless due to notifications working intermittently 
len ratingone Our group will stay on slack until teams notifications is fixed and reliable 
len ratingfive Thank god slack bought hipchat 
len ratingfive Cause then we moved to Teams 
len ratingfive It s a great way to stay in touch with people and keep each other in track 
len ratingfive I m in high school and it helps with group projects and assignments 
len ratingfive Also good for planning events with lots of people 
len ratingfive I would recommend 
len ratingfive Love teams the latest updates make a huge difference and bring collaboration to the next level 
len ratingfive One feature request however that is essential that many people talk about in MS forums is to have the ability to move wiki to the front of a channel vs having the channel chat tab be the default 
len ratingfive Can we please get this activated 
len ratingfive Teams is so far behind in the messaging front 
len ratingfive Slack and Discord have it beat hands down 
len ratingfive Still the app works well so enjoy it for what it is 
len ratingfive This is a great company 
len ratingfive Easy user friendly 
len ratingfive Helps me connect with anyone one in our office with a simple click 
len ratingone No longer works on iPhone Pro 
len ratingfive  I don t know how I d make it through the day without it 
len ratingone  This app literally has new issues every week 
len ratingone Today it s not even letting me sign in 
len ratingone Other days there are issues typically revolving around receiving notifications 
len ratingone As I said something new every week 
len ratingfive It makes team communication a breeze 
len ratingfive This tool is quite useful to communicate with teams both local amp global 
len ratingfour I love Teams app but it would be a lot better in terms of user experience if it had an outlook calendar type view instead of a list view of calendar entries 
len ratingfour From list view one has to identify overlaps and gaps in time but if teams supported outlook calendar type view it would make it a more intuitive 
len ratingfour Looking forward to it in a future release 
len ratingfive It s easy and I can connect with other reps and easy for them to respond
len ratingfive Teams is awesome 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Great way to keep in touch with your co workers without having to sift through all the emails in your inbox 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone You can chat 
len ratingone Planner works 
len ratingone That s about all 
len ratingfive I love their service 
len ratingfive I am enjoying using it 
len ratingfive Definitely see where this app is headed 
len ratingfive Skype for Business should really take note 
len ratingfive Teams actually does everything right 
len ratingfive One suggestion is to put in WhatsApp like reply features so it feels more like focus texting on the mobile app
len ratingone Notifications come late 
len ratingone Useless app when you don t know someone is waiting for your response until you open the app and browse through teams 
len ratingone The same issue with the desktop app 
len ratingfour I like this application 
len ratingfour I world like it to see the below items added ability to set a reminder of selected conversations channel notifications settings need to configurable would like an easier way to see who are the members of a team
len ratingone Can t login on new iPhone Pro
len ratingfive Words can not express my feelings for Teams 
len ratingfive I love this phone all because I can reply to specific messages 
len ratingfive  Can t do that on the desktop version yet 
len ratingfive Love the one stop shop approach
len ratingthree Notifications don t work half of the time 
len ratingthree Good collaborative but msft needs to improve alerting features
len ratingfive If you love being traced and connected to work all the time this app is great 
len ratingone Experienced consistent second audio delays when receiving calls through application 
len ratingone Oftentimes hear echoing of my own voice for the first few seconds as well until the delay dissipates and the conversation audio connection finally initiates 
len ratingone This has been replicated and experienced by multiple colleagues of mine all of whom are using the most updated version of the application 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX ASAP 
len ratingthree Seems made for a technical audience 
len ratingthree Wish it was a little simpler 
len ratingfive I am about to ditch my laptop 
len ratingfive This app is amazing integrates seamlessly with the IPad even allowing for sharing files from either iCloud or OneDrive seamlessly 
len ratingfive Video conferencing just works audio quality is equivalent to a multi thousand dollar video conferencing equipment 
len ratingfive Tremendous value and utility stars 
len ratingone Some recent update killed the notifications 
len ratingone I receive messages just fine however there is no vibration whatsoever 
len ratingone I ve checked all notifications on iOS and in the app nothing 
len ratingone It won t vibrate even when my phone is unlocked 
len ratingone I ve reset everything 
len ratingone Deleted the app and added it back 
len ratingone Nothing fixes it 
len ratingone I have the settings set so it should notify for everything 
len ratingone Hopefully this will be resolved quickly 
len ratingfive App works great and ties you back to your desktop 
len ratingfive Allows you to communicate and work remotely but in a seamless way 
len ratingfive As a business owner this app helps me to connect to my staff all over 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive As a user I thoroughly enjoy using Teams from my mobile device 
len ratingfive Best platform and best mobile app for collaboration period 
len ratingtwo Text Search capability is missing and history should be saved
len ratingthree After installing and using teams lightly maybe check once hour during the day my iPhone is running out of juice before the end of the day 
len ratingthree I wish I could continue to use but it doesn t get good enough mileage for me I m choosing an iPhone with battery left at the end of my day 
len ratingfive Works as intended
len ratingfive This app is very diversified for its utilization 
len ratingfive Great all around 
len ratingfive Love it I love Michael
len ratingfive What an app it is awesome that 
len ratingfive I never thought teams is this useful for collaboration 
len ratingfive We previously used slack zoom and google for team collaboration but this is really great
len ratingfour Option to be able to search a key word or persons comments in large chat groups would be helpful 
len ratingfour Option to be able to delete a chat versus only hiding it 
len ratingone Most frustrating app to use 
len ratingone My notes will be added but it will not upload reliably to the server causing duplicate work 
len ratingone This needs fixed 
len ratingthree i consult with many orgs at a time 
len ratingthree the ability to switch between them quickly would be nice
len ratingfour For some reason I always appear as available although I m away from desk it doesn t automatically mark you as away for inactivity the only feature I miss about Sametime IBM chat
len ratingfive I love the App and it is connected with my PC as well thus when I m out of office I can be still connected using my mobile
len ratingfour Per the title 
len ratingfour Also stop overlaying things over conversation 
len ratingfive We like the App but there is no sound Notification
len ratingfour Great app for communicating and working with coworkers 
len ratingfour The easy access to files and sharing capabilities are wonderful 
len ratingfour However I am unable to get notifications 
len ratingfour The app states to go to the Settings app to enable the notifications but once there no option do do so is available 
len ratingfour I d re align the icons on the bottom 
len ratingfour Left to right Chat teams activity calendar phone 
len ratingfour I think most people use as an inter office communication device or to replace excess text messages 
len ratingfour If so make that first 
len ratingone I specifically have notifications and background activity for Teams turned off yet the app still consumes of my battery each day from background activity this is without using it or having the app open at all 
len ratingone I do not trust this app or Microsoft 
len ratingfive I have been using Microsoft Teams with our entire organization for about months now and I must say I don t think I can go a day without it it is one of the most important tools in our company today 
len ratingfive If you haven t tried it you owe it to yourself especially if you are a O user 
len ratingfive Is it possible to add ability to see the all ppl in the meeting 
len ratingfive It is hard to find who is there specially when more than attending 
len ratingfive It is very helpful 
len ratingfour I like it 
len ratingfour Quit asking me if I like it 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingfour The app is awesome 
len ratingfour Super useful and easy to use 
len ratingfour I would love however if I could access my notes from OneNote
len ratingtwo Awful static connect process sometimes does not hook up right get feedback all the time unless on a headset direct to PC 
len ratingtwo These need to be addressed
len ratingone I hate this thing but I m forced for work 
len ratingone It s way too confusing 
len ratingfive This little App has all kinds of capabilities 
len ratingfive It s great for a text app that you can send gifs images videos etc 
len ratingfive I use it for my business so all my team members can share info send documents have e meetings conference calls etc 
len ratingfive super powerful and very intuitive easy to use 
len ratingfive Simple to use and navigate but still really functional
len ratingfive This app changes how I view Microsoft 
len ratingfive They actually got it right the app is clean and fast 
len ratingfour If accept teams meeting on phone how do I transfer to my PC 
len ratingfive Excellent and easy via desktop or phone 
len ratingfive It s really good 
len ratingfive The teams applications is an amazing alternative to about other collaborative apps all in one 
len ratingfive We ve been encouraging folks to use it within our IT department at my company and we love it so far 
len ratingfive Once I found out it was free I ve been recommending it to everyone I know 
len ratingfive Way to actually build something the way humans actually want it for a change Microsoft 
len ratingfive You guys are starting to get it together again I think 
len ratingfive I always think that and then you come out with some Windows equivalent nightmare 
len ratingfive So don t take a big Vista in your pants and try to keep it up 
len ratingtwo This app makes me want to gouge my eyes out
len ratingfive F
len ratingfive Office team did Mac 
len ratingfive Hey with the program 
len ratingfive Dark mode isn t working here 
len ratingfive  apple I have not
len ratingfour Love the app 
len ratingfour However I wish I could see everyone s past post on their profile instead of scrolling forever on the feed 
len ratingthree I used a similar program called Slack for several years and it was much more intuitive than Teams 
len ratingthree That said Teams is a solid app 
len ratingthree I think my employer could use it better than they currently are 
len ratingthree I think the Teams Meetings work really well as I have to collaborate with fellow employees all over the world 
len ratingthree The audio is always really clear 
len ratingone calls hang up automatically when anyone calls on teams
len ratingone The interface isn t intuitive 
len ratingone There are chats and groups and groups in them have channels 
len ratingone No option to switch from phone to computer call in the middle of the meeting 
len ratingone Doesn t handle transition from WiFi to Cellular that well 
len ratingone Switching between accounts is only possible on mobile device 
len ratingone But the interface is little too much 
len ratingone Still haven t understood the use of call tab 
len ratingone Seems unnecessary 
len ratingtwo I will add my voice to the chorus here serious battery drain 
len ratingtwo Seems to have gotten worse with 
len ratingtwo Even with background refresh turned OFF anywhere it can be off 
len ratingtwo  this app kills the battery 
len ratingtwo I hope someone if working on a fix for this and rolls it out SOON 
len ratingtwo  Sorry for the trouble and thank you for sharing your feedback 
len ratingtwo We are working on reducing the battery consumption for notifications and background updates to keep your messages synced 
len ratingtwo And we expect to see improvements in the coming months 
len ratingtwo Can you PLEASE remove the persistent banner that appears when you do not have notifications turned on 
len ratingtwo Users who choose to not get notifications will always see this reminder throughout the app 
len ratingtwo It doesn t help that the verbiage on the reminder seems a little pesky Aside from this perpetual annoyance the app is truly fantastic 
len ratingtwo It s easy and quick I prefer it over the desktop version even 
len ratingfive Great app you can use anywhere that s what I love about it 
len ratingfour Teams shall automatically shut down the teams app call if the option of cellular call me is selected 
len ratingfour I have to manually end teams call and accept the phone call 
len ratingfour Love the app and concept but needs work 
len ratingfour How do I initiate multiple calls and navigate a touch tone menu on the nd call 
len ratingfour Want to add sort create groups and contacts 
len ratingfour Needs to have pinned chats not just channels 
len ratingfour Sync notifications 
len ratingfour If I read a message on one device push the marked read to all other devices 
len ratingthree Please add an Apple Watch version of teams 
len ratingfour Great app while on the run
len ratingone  I use this as a sso through the company I work for and it signs me out regularly 
len ratingone I ve also never received a notification from the app when I have a new chat or team update 
len ratingone So far the mobile app is garbage 
len ratingone Teams on the desktop is pretty good
len ratingfour We use Teams for work and overall I like the app there are a few downsides 
len ratingfour For some reason it doesn t keep your pinned conversations so I have to scroll for people I talk to and pin the most
len ratingthree Being MS Teams is replacing Skype I found this feature is missing 
len ratingthree Skype has Apple Watch support for messages which is invaluable especially when away from your work station or working from home 
len ratingthree Any plans to add this functionality 
len ratingfive This just works 
len ratingfive Compared to how snappy Skype was this is way ahead of it 
len ratingfive Everything just works and I haven t seen any issues in the last year 
len ratingfive It works on both Apple and android devices alike 
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfive I use it all the time
len ratingone This app constantly signs me out and then I don t receive notifications 
len ratingone Awful 
len ratingfive Teams is awesome no other app lets you share anything on your desktop 
len ratingfive The vision and sound clarity with our team around the world is both outstanding and much better than Skype and Cisco
len ratingone This app devours my battery with its background activities 
len ratingone Just a couple days ago I had the app on screen for minutes but it ate of my battery 
len ratingone Yikes 
len ratingone I ve disabled background app refresh for the app let s see if this improves things 
len ratingone I ll update my review once I see things improve 
len ratingone  Sorry for the trouble and thank you for sharing your feedback 
len ratingone We are working on reducing the battery consumption for notifications and background updates to keep your messages synced 
len ratingone And we expect to see improvements in the coming months 
len ratingone We use teams for communication at work our team relies heavily on it 
len ratingone However the audible alerts are very inconsistent on my iPhone 
len ratingone I have tried all the troubleshooting tips given here and in the app other than resettting my phone 
len ratingone I wish this could be fixed 
len ratingfive Can t say enough about how well MS built this mobile experience 
len ratingfive Same is true of the iPad experience 
len ratingfive Super usable and consistent across all platforms 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone The app never gives my notifications on my phone 
len ratingone On the computer it never makes a sound 
len ratingfour There are many useful feature and the call quality is great 
len ratingfour There are several missing features already discussed on forums and when presenting screen there is the often happening issue of screen pie this is where the screen is cut into black not visible strips followed by what I am presenting followed by not visible strips where ever the mouse moves 
len ratingfour Also the mobile version is very slow in telling me about missed notification even though I am on WiFi After all this and more it still beats WebEx teams but not Slack 
len ratingfour Slack is just great at all this and much more by a mile
len ratingone This app drains my battery due to Background activity and there is no way to stop it even with background refresh turned off to all apps this is a shame because I need this app for work related stuff but can t have it because poor battery management issues if this gets fixed I ll update my review
len ratingfive It s a great app 
len ratingfive Helps me stay connected with my office and our offices around the country 
len ratingfive Much better for quick and easy communication 
len ratingfour So far I have really enjoyed using Teams on iPhone 
len ratingfour Specifically ios 
len ratingfour The one thing that holds me back from a five star rating is that while better than desktop the notification solution for having multiple tenants is still hard to use 
len ratingone Keeps saying I am offline
len ratingone  App is good but lacking features 
len ratingone Please add support for wiki 
len ratingone And allow simultaneous multi domain login 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble caused 
len ratingone Can you please take the latest update and let us know if you still see this issue 
len ratingone It will help if you can share debug logs from App when you see this issue using Hamburger Menu gt Setti
len ratingfive We love it and use it everyday 
len ratingfive I am loving this software so user friendly a cave man could operate it 
len ratingfive The versatility of all the key functions is extremely useful in my field of work 
len ratingfive So far I have had no issues with speed lag or crashes 
len ratingfive Found it very useful quickly and lot of options 
len ratingfive Easy to manage creative developers 
len ratingfive Cheers 
len ratingfive Hello teams 
len ratingfive Love it goodbye Skype nice knowing ya 
len ratingone I am not going to turn on notifications 
len ratingone This is an intentional decision 
len ratingone I do not want work messages pushed to my personal phone 
len ratingone PLEASE stop asking me to turn on notifications 
len ratingfive Is there an app that doesn t integrate with Teams 
len ratingfive Not really 
len ratingfour i m shocked that Teams doesn t have CarPlay support yet 
len ratingfour It would be great to get formal support so I can join my meetings in the car 
len ratingfour This is a really great product 
len ratingfour But it does not work well on Apple Products 
len ratingfour Like I can t upload a large video from my iPhone which I have an iPhone but it will work on an android real well 
len ratingone  Awful 
len ratingone This is really bad 
len ratingone Slack is way better 
len ratingthree The new Lotus Notes 
len ratingthree The app is fine but the inability to manage as well on the backend is huge over site for all corporate enterprise IT admins 
len ratingthree Still no way to prevent employees from changing their picture as can be done with O 
len ratingfive Really helpful for team coronation 
len ratingfive Thank you to unsung hero s like Nate Yohannes who leads a team of experts that make these applications top notch 
len ratingfive Please make sure you tell his boss to give that man a raise and promotion
len ratingfive Honestly believe Teams transformed the way my whole organization works 
len ratingfive From a collaboration and productivity standpoint Teams is an evolutionary game changer 
len ratingfour What s app notification is better 
len ratingfour It does not let you miss it 
len ratingfive I love how seamless it is to move from my desktop to my phone 
len ratingfive All the functionality comes along with it 
len ratingfive Love teams
len ratingthree I wish teams had read receipts 
len ratingthree That would be super useful and would encourage me to exclusively use it for all my group chatting needs 
len ratingfive Teams is awesome
len ratingfive Just with my co workers used it more than email
len ratingfive This is best collaboration and productivity app 
len ratingfive My company moved to teams and consolidated share point as well 
len ratingfive Great platform for centralized collaboration and sharing 
len ratingtwo It s infuriating to use particularly notifications that just stop working for no reason 
len ratingfour It s a great app with tons of features but one feature that is lacking is the ability to reply to particular message in one on one or group chat 
len ratingone Guys you CANNOT HAVE the screen on or off button on the iPhone end a conference call 
len ratingone Many people use speaker phone and turn the screen off to save battery 
len ratingone This option needs to be turned off 
len ratingfive It s the bees knees 
len ratingfive  Microsoft Teams is adopted widely in my organization 
len ratingfive We moved away from Slack one of the best decisions we have made 
len ratingfive It s no brainer and a great way to share docs pics and communications in a group with a team 
len ratingfive The one touch immediate connection for conf calls is a major improvement in efficiency 
len ratingfive There is no EYE in TEAM 
len ratingthree Works pretty well but could definitely use the ability to be more granular with notifications and to snooze them for certain channels
len ratingfive Flexible Mobile Straightforward collaboration across everyone worldwide 
len ratingfive It works 
len ratingone The desktop app for Teams is awesome I can t say enough good things about it but the mobile app just doesn t cut it 
len ratingone Why can t we edit the wiki 
len ratingone Why can t we upload photos or files without posting in the chat 
len ratingone My main need is not the chat feature it s the documentation organization and coordination which renders this app useless 
len ratingone Sorry Microsoft you re so close 
len ratingfive Embrace it 
len ratingfive Email is dead 
len ratingfive This application is a favorite of mine as it lets us all collaborate together and share files in real time 
len ratingthree It crashes or locks up quite a it on Mac 
len ratingthree Like the app though 
len ratingthree I disabled background refresh and notification for this app but even with it disabled if you check battery this is rd app draining at without even using it 
len ratingthree Uninstalled it 
len ratingfive We work in a medical office and this is a great tool for communicating 
len ratingfive We use this for communication between our front office and back office staff really a helps maintain work flow 
len ratingtwo On my computer my college can t see my face on video call
len ratingfive  They forced me to rate they did things
len ratingfour  Teams seems pretty good 
len ratingfour I just wish it had the option that slack has to write a message to yourself that is saved as a note for later 
len ratingfour This way it s a nice feature to keep work information Seperate from your other apps 
len ratingfour Video conference and other things seems quite good
len ratingfour Need UI enhancements
len ratingthree Needs more features and a better UI
len ratingfive Teams on mobile works perfectly
len ratingfive Teams is the most versatile collaboration platform I have had the privilege to use 
len ratingthree Hi I wish you could have separate windows for chat when you want too 
len ratingthree Thank you Jenn
len ratingfive I have implemented Microsoft Teams at my company and it s been great thus far 
len ratingfive Wish they would add a feature to record hours worked on a single task but other than that it is a great app 
len ratingfive Increased our productivity tremendously 
len ratingfive Five stars for sure recommend 
len ratingfive Had to fight to use this software at my company and it s paying off 
len ratingfour Seems to drain the battery faster than it should 
len ratingfour The ink and background colors are not consistent 
len ratingfour Right now I am fighting this message on a white background with white ink 
len ratingfour I am using a dark mode 
len ratingfour But this mode is not applicable to all features 
len ratingfive Great tool for my everyday tasks
len ratingfive Great app love it 
len ratingfour Used for work group messaging 
len ratingfour The lack of watch app makes notifications difficult 
len ratingfour Develop watch app please 
len ratingfive  A really great Microsoft product 
len ratingfive RealWear com
len ratingfive Need to be able to select multiple photo attachments at once Also need to be able to type a caption for photos
len ratingfour Ridiculous to have a messaging app where you cannot send share view videos 
len ratingfour They say its coming in an update but that seems like something that would have been done in alpha testing 
len ratingfour My only gripe is the app doesn t always notify me when I get a message and that is sometimes a problem
len ratingfour Awesome concept and huge potential 
len ratingfour The major downside is that this introduced a paradigm shift in workplace communication 
len ratingfour That s not a bad thing at all but when first launching the app it would be great to have a tutorial 
len ratingfour Also having that tutorial available anytime in the app would be nice 
len ratingfour Tutorial could show the basic icons in the app what they do and examples of functions to do within that app
len ratingfive I love how TEAMS enables us to capture retain and share program project information in a single bucket The old way of email was ok but information tends to be fleeting 
len ratingfive Here it is more permanent and accessible 
len ratingfour One thing I m very concern about is my notifications isn t working
len ratingfive We only need the raise hand
len ratingfour I was thorn when writing this review 
len ratingfour App is actually nice 
len ratingfour I find Microsoft Teams platform itself being convoluted complicated resource hog with bloated collection of features that of our users does not need or want 
len ratingfour But iPhone app is actually decent I prefer it over the desktop client 
len ratingfour Although it does drain battery 
len ratingfour I wish MS would do something about that 
len ratingone I m an IT consultant for BB and when I give demos of both slack and teams slack is always the customers choice for ease of use and not forced to stay within the Microsoft suite 
len ratingone I have a lot of clients who use O and all of them would rather pay to use slack 
len ratingone Teams feels like a rushed competitor that s late too the game 
len ratingfour I appreciate this app because it allows me to stay up to date in real time with my team 
len ratingfour There have been times when my wi fi connection has failed and I ve been able to open this app and handle business like I never missed a beat 
len ratingfour That s a huge value in my field 
len ratingfour Kudos to the developers 
len ratingfive So much better and more useful is Teams relative to emails and messaging where things can cross in transit and One has to Navigate and search for all related Items 
len ratingfive Very
len ratingfive I can t I can t
len ratingfive I ve used many other apps like this but this is by far the best 
len ratingtwo Mobile version does not yet have the ability to click Teams shared file links 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating until they get that functionality added 
len ratingtwo Having to swap back and forth between Outlook and OneDrive Sharepoint Libraries because Teams file sharing doesn t work is tiring while paying for Office 
len ratingtwo Fix that and it s stars 
len ratingfour I will really love it when we open up more apps that help us in our productivity 
len ratingfive Teams on the desktop is good but the Teams mobile app allows me to move around and be well mobile 
len ratingfive Quick discussions are possible and easy decisions can be made real time from anywhere 
len ratingfive Force multiplier 
len ratingfive Never have been a big fan of Office or the Microsoft suite but they knocked it out of the park with this one 
len ratingfive I expected this to be an bad copy of Slack but almost all of our teams prefer this to Slack hands down 
len ratingfive The wiki files chat and hierarchical organization are big improvements over anything else out there 
len ratingthree Phone quality the pits Couldn t get into meeting Im great
len ratingfive Great Convenience across devices 
len ratingone  So far the only thing useful to me about teams is the planner 
len ratingone It s just a little clunky on my work PC but still worthwhile for tracking and assigning tasks 
len ratingone I tried out the app briefly and quickly deleted it as utterly useless and clunky as hell 
len ratingone When I try to open the planner tabs I ve created for each team it redirects to safari and asks me to log in again 
len ratingone For some reason if I go into the options it will allow me to open the planner tab in the app 
len ratingone That s an extra step every single frikkin time to do something in the app 
len ratingone Useless 
len ratingone Utterly useless 
len ratingone There is decent potential in Teams but Microsoft obviously has their B Team developing it 
len ratingthree Some annoyances a 
len ratingthree None of us want to hear when someone is exiting the call 
len ratingthree It interrupts whoever is talking and makes it difficult to give presentations 
len ratingthree Please provide an option to disable this feature in a call 
len ratingthree b 
len ratingthree Anyone can mute the main speaker and it seems to affect all listeners 
len ratingthree A user should mute for themself only and not affect the listening experience of others 
len ratingthree c File upload is laggy 
len ratingthree Otherwise Microsoft has done a pretty great Slack clone 
len ratingthree Resolving these few problems would get it a star from me 
len ratingfour Needs easy channel switching like in slack and I will switch on it entirely 
len ratingfive Full featured and great for seamless participation in meetings while on the go 
len ratingfive It is even my preferred audio platform for meetings over the desktop version even if I am attending via the desktop 
len ratingfive We recently were forced to switch and start using the Teams app 
len ratingfive It wasn t received well at the office but after day one we were thrilled 
len ratingfive It works great and there is so many advantages to using it 
len ratingfive One of my favorite features is the meeting 
len ratingfive Click join and go 
len ratingone this app is one of the worst pieces of trash to ever be released 
len ratingone enjoy the included spyware and the drain on your batteries 
len ratingone  hope the next ransomware attack destroys this company good 
len ratingone they bring nothing to the development game 
len ratingone except maybe enabling the weak to set the pace for the herd 
len ratingone good luck with that 
len ratingone nbs
len ratingfour This is the best tool for just that 
len ratingfour Love the features just wish there were more free app s available for download 
len ratingfour File sharing could be more seamless with third party apps
len ratingthree Communication is made available quickly 
len ratingthree However having a format like Slack would be beneficial 
len ratingfive Perfectly match for my needs as a software engineer
len ratingfive It works so good that my coworkers can bother me at all hours of the day 
len ratingfive Highly recommend 
len ratingthree This is more about the desktop but it probably applies on IOS as well 
len ratingthree On the desktop it seems like Microsoft is treating Teams like it is a third rate app 
len ratingthree I just got an Outlook update and it prompted me to try Teams 
len ratingthree Hey Microsoft you nut cases I have been using Teams for months 
len ratingthree Figure it out 
len ratingthree You can t even handle links to it without going through the browser 
len ratingthree Seriously 
len ratingthree Teams app works ok within members of the same company 
len ratingthree Using it with outside people is a different story 
len ratingthree There is echo and sometimes broken and missing words during communication 
len ratingthree I will give a better review if the voice over IP is better 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfour The app is very convenient 
len ratingfour It makes finding coverage much faster 
len ratingfour It can eliminate so many texts and emails about the schedule because all you have to do is use the program 
len ratingfive Wonderful tool to use at a satellite office easy to share documents to collaborate and mobile friendly 
len ratingthree Everything is great with the exception that it is not possible to edit Wiki notes 
len ratingthree  stars until then due to the impact on collaborative ability 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Integration with office is a great plus
len ratingthree Some of the features are not user friendly 
len ratingthree But it s easy to text a group and add files
len ratingfive Roll several applications into one makes collaborating more simplified
len ratingone Can t upload or open files in other MS apps 
len ratingone Bordering on useless 
len ratingone It shuts off as soon as I open the messaging option 
len ratingone Unable to access from IPhone XS Max 
len ratingone Just getting blank page
len ratingfive A mix of Skype Slack Google Docs con current document editing and WebEx all packed into one 
len ratingfive Main advantage for Teams admins is compliance and control 
len ratingfive Go Microsoft 
len ratingfour Many nice features requires less bandwidth than Skype for business 
len ratingfour I just wish there was a home dashboard with the status of a list of your people upcoming appointments etc 
len ratingfour Love Teams but would really like the ability to block o certain users or ignore them 
len ratingfive An app who does everything Chat upload files video meetings keep dates book rooms for meetings scheduling 
len ratingfive Fabulous Simultanious work space
len ratingthree  Really hard to find files and don t understand how to navigate fully 
len ratingthree Just seems a bit awkward 
len ratingthree Maybe I need to learn more but not as intuitive out of the gate as I would like 
len ratingfour Dark mode should be more like gray mode 
len ratingfour But it works well 
len ratingfour Chatting with external contacts is seem less and similar to using the desktop app 
len ratingfive The App is great as my laptop lets me down from time to time so being able to connect to Teams via the app has proven essential 
len ratingthree Gifs no longer auto play and I don t auto play in iOS 
len ratingthree May be switching ap types if not resolved quickly 
len ratingone I downloaded the Teams app a while ago intending to check it out but hadn t even logged into it yet 
len ratingone After the most recent app update I checked my IP connection logs and was surprised to find a series of Microsoft sub domains related to the Teams app gov dot teams dod dot teams etc 
len ratingone which then connected me to various US government military top level domains 
len ratingone Why would it do this 
len ratingone I don t do anything at all related to the US government 
len ratingone While there s probably some reasonably benign explanation for this I ve uninstalled the app entirely now because of this and will avoid it in future 
len ratingfive I ve never used a team meeting app before but I can say this one is nice 
len ratingfive I see everyone and it doesn t end the conference call 
len ratingfive I would recommend this to someone 
len ratingfour It would be nice if it supported iOS system wide dark mode 
len ratingfour Also better integration with the outlook app 
len ratingfour The hamburger menu physics feel off it doesn t track my finger 
len ratingone Pls review your QA and development process 
len ratingone There are too many updates 
len ratingfour I like Teams for a lot of things but why it is impossible to make a quote and reply easily 
len ratingfour Would be great to get rich chatting tools soon
len ratingfour Teams is a great way to collaborate on any project 
len ratingfour They have a great deal of optional integrations 
len ratingfour We use Smartsheet and Planner regularly 
len ratingfour I wish there could be private channels within a team however 
len ratingfour  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingfour Private channel support was announced this week and should become available in the latest version of the App when it gets enabled in Teams 
len ratingfour Please refer to for more
len ratingfour The app won t stay on 
len ratingfour It s great when it works 
len ratingfive  This is awsome
len ratingone This is crap 
len ratingone I am able to use it on web and mac app 
len ratingone I have teams and org setup 
len ratingone But when I try to login on my iPhone using the same id it just keeps saying Looks like you don t have teams setup and when I say setup teams nothing happens 
len ratingone Ridiculous Microsoft 
len ratingfive Love this tool and it just keeps getting better
len ratingfive  Very goo interaction for office production employees 
len ratingfive I wish the video feature gave the two views on panoramic and focus when individuals talk
len ratingfive Team work at its best
len ratingfive Been using this app since it launched and we LOVE it 
len ratingfive TY Microsoft 
len ratingfive I ve used it all GroupMe Slack Trello Google Drive etc 
len ratingfive Teams is by far the most inclusive of everything you need 
len ratingfive You and your team can chat have different channels for topics video call by one click have all working documents in a files tab so much better than having to search for minutes 
len ratingfive Also for teams niche needs there is also the option to add third party apps design apps communication sales you name it 
len ratingfive It s design is intuitive 
len ratingfive Multiple groups can coexist in harmony by its easily navigable interface 
len ratingfive Whether it s a school group project a side passion project roommates chat roller blading club or at work teams supports it all 
len ratingfive Would highly recommend 
len ratingfive I really like Teams 
len ratingfive Easier to use than GTM or Zoom and integrates well with all the other O apps 
len ratingfive Good video and voice quality and a great for chat 
len ratingfive Very useful and powerful 
len ratingfive Everyone should be using it 
len ratingfive Having a search fiel within a chat would be very helpful to keep up with specific topics between a large group conversation
len ratingfour Teams is new to our company and the more we use it the more helpful it is 
len ratingfour Nothing is perfect for every business but this one is getting very close 
len ratingfour We would to be able to share documents spread sheets with a group but only make certain people access to edit it we re still searching for this option or something like this 
len ratingfour Good software but has worse emojis ever 
len ratingfive This is really a helpful app and have lot of features 
len ratingthree Good functionality but not as easy to use as Slack 
len ratingthree All other Microsoft products have Dark mode and Teams doesn t 
len ratingthree I wonder why it feels clunkier and circa compared to the rest of the app suite 
len ratingfive I live on Microsoft Teams at work chat files etc 
len ratingfive The mobile app is an indispensable part of my ability to stay connected
len ratingfive Very convenient to have teams on my phone too 
len ratingfive We use this all day with our personnel in the field
len ratingtwo I find it hard to believe that more people don t see this as a fatal flaw 
len ratingtwo The Teams integration does not allow files to be saved to Teams folders 
len ratingtwo The same is true for the OneDrive and SharePoint apps 
len ratingtwo So nothing in the Microsoft s stable of file accessibility apps can save files to business folders 
len ratingtwo Doesn t anyone else see a problem with this 
len ratingfive  going well and mobile app is terrific
len ratingfive We have about people spread throughout buildings with some of them remote and it make it easy to communicate and stay in touch 
len ratingfive Emails and text messages are one thing but to make a quick call or video call make it much more personal 
len ratingfive This is especially true for when communicating with our partners 
len ratingfive Forms needs more capacity to do certain things
len ratingthree Audio From connected computer is Not Good
len ratingfive  Best thing since sliced bread 
len ratingtwo Very disappointed that mute unmute function does not work 
len ratingtwo My company is struggling with this and many meetings are less productive as a result 
len ratingfour It is great to be able to do all the Teams stuff from my phone 
len ratingfour I wish MS Teams Shifts would have a little of Excel functionality 
len ratingfour Specifically the ability to freeze panes so the left hand side of the screen and the top of the screen remains viewable 
len ratingfour I have people using shifts for out of office event support in office duties 
len ratingfour Hard to view 
len ratingfive  This is a very helpful app for work 
len ratingone After the iOS update the app doesn t show on my screen anymore
len ratingthree Need an easy way to upload files to the proper channel on teams verses just attaching in a conversation 
len ratingone  Running outlook and teams with Authenticator 
len ratingone Now requiring me to re enter Touch ID whenever I switch apps to multitask 
len ratingone Major pain 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive Meetings and call quality is great 
len ratingfive Call dialpad is hidden and difficult to find and many clicks away when you want to call 
len ratingfive Also doesn t show the most recent or frequent calls
len ratingone I m burning through how much battery life every few days for an update 
len ratingone What is all that bloat 
len ratingone You do realize multimedia payload don t need to be packaged with the App and redundantly downloaded with every update yes 
len ratingone How much more bloat you got in there 
len ratingtwo First thing I notice is that Teams does not offer an Apple Watch app for calendar notifications 
len ratingtwo Second the form feels blocky and does not have a smooth flow 
len ratingtwo Just your basic chat functionality 
len ratingtwo Missing lots of features that seem rudimentary nowadays 
len ratingtwo Third is the fact that Microsoft forced the installation on all windows workstations with default startup function and you cannot seem to remove it because it keeps reinstalling itself 
len ratingtwo Maybe people don t want to use it because it is crap 
len ratingtwo Maybe they should implement a developer and customer feedback process to improve Teams before forcing it upon people 
len ratingtwo I would be willing to give it a higher rating if it actually kept up with much smaller and much better team chat products 
len ratingone Until you can edit within the IOS app is has extremely limited use 
len ratingone How is 
len ratingone My Team supposed to be mobile if they can t work in the field 
len ratingfour Good app 
len ratingfour Please give team owners the ability to delete other people s conversation thread 
len ratingfive The fact that its on my i phone is awesome 
len ratingfour Separate window or the ability to pop out a window 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Love the functionality 
len ratingfive I love my MS products but this has to be the best app for Office ever 
len ratingfive There are some not so intuitive menus but being able to group chat and being able to work on files simultaneously with other people makes teamwork a breeze 
len ratingfive Outstanding 
len ratingfive There are a bunch of features needed of course 
len ratingfive But so long as the MA guys are working on those I can t ask for more 
len ratingfive This is a great app for the workplace 
len ratingfive Very convenient and essential app for all office user
len ratingfive My company was an early adopter of Teams so I have had the mixed pleasure of being a user throughout its development 
len ratingfive Gotta say though it has evolved into a fine working application 
len ratingfive Connections are great 
len ratingfive Video voice chat presence awareness etc they all work well 
len ratingfive Desktop app can still be a bit heavy and some of its desktop notification functionality could use improvement but that s it 
len ratingone It won t let me sign in 
len ratingone I even uninstalled it and it still won t let me 
len ratingone I need to turn in an essay by midnight and my teacher wants it through teams 
len ratingthree I have multiple email accounts that are associated with teams 
len ratingthree Being able to log in to both teams accounts simultaneously and get notifications would be huge 
len ratingthree Other than that it is great 
len ratingfive Great for communicating coordinating materials and even virtual meetings
len ratingone This app opens with the Teams logo and thats it 
len ratingone It simply doesnt work with iOS 
len ratingthree I swear this app is eating the life out of my battery 
len ratingthree I would charge my phone every couple of days and since I downloaded this app I am charging my phone almost every day
len ratingfive It s a must have app for every corporate team 
len ratingone I recently switched from android to iOS 
len ratingone Teams on iOS does not allow me to use the Teams emojis 
len ratingone Instead it inserts a plain version vs the Teams version 
len ratingfive We migrated from another media of communication to Teams few months back and what I really felt good is that the Audi calls are very clean with no disturbance and mobile app has quick access 
len ratingfive Maintainance the history of the chat is the best feature 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Great communication tool
len ratingfive I found Teams a great app that facilitates all storage communication while at office and outside
len ratingfive Really like the Adobe integration as well 
len ratingthree I love MA Teams 
len ratingthree The only issue I have right now is that it no longer shows as an optional app for Car Play since the latest iOS device 
len ratingthree I called Apple to tell them several features broke my Car Play since the latest iOS update and the response was that I need to call the company of each application to let them know it s no longer compatible 
len ratingthree Funny thing though I repeated twice that one app that no longer works on the car display is iTunes playlist 
len ratingthree Either way I join a lot of conference calls for my job through Teams and now it s no longer an option for my car display through Car Play 
len ratingfive Teams is a great tool for simple communications and the connectors to Jira and Dynamics is a higher bonus 
len ratingfive WebEx AMD zoom can t not even come close to the connector and channel experience
len ratingtwo How frustrating 
len ratingtwo It keeps saying I don t have a license but I do and I can sign in everywhere but my Iphone 
len ratingtwo Can get it to work 
len ratingone  I like the app more than staffhub but they still need to upgrade the scheduling options and interface 
len ratingone Once those options are added I ll review the app again 
len ratingone It s not ideal the way it currently is for our departments needs 
len ratingfive This is a wonderful system and app 
len ratingfive This app is a game changer
len ratingfive It all just works 
len ratingfive This app works reasonably well 
len ratingfive Fixing notifications got me back yo using it 
len ratingfive It s not a Slack killer yet but it s a sufficient replacement especially if you re already using Office 
len ratingone I love the functionality on Teams but I can t get thru a full work day any more with how badly this app drains the battery even when it s idle 
len ratingone And when it is in use I can lose a minute in battery 
len ratingone Battery health is and using iOS 
len ratingone Microsoft step it up 
len ratingfour Love it 
len ratingfour Only downside is that it used to automatically open on my desktop but it s stopped doing that now 
len ratingfour The mobile app is amazing 
len ratingfour No problems there 
len ratingtwo Ok the app does its main job for me tells me when I work but I don t get notifications about my schedule and why the heck isn t there an option to see my schedule when I first open the app it s annoying that I have to click on the notification to then see when I work and when I click on the time I should just be able to see who is working and who isn t working 
len ratingtwo I have to go through so many unnecessary steps just to find that info 
len ratingtwo Look I get it this app is new bud go look at hotschedule s app and take a page from their book 
len ratingtwo Actually take a whole chapter from their book 
len ratingtwo I don t just write bad reviews like most people do 
len ratingtwo Fix these silly little issues and I m happy to change my opinion 
len ratingtwo Granted this is really the only feature I use in the app so I m sure it s a great app otherwise but this is my main concern 
len ratingfive The mobility and flexibility of the app has been a pleasantly surprising experience contrary to my initial expectations 
len ratingfive It provides a much more seem less and intuitively laid out interface making the work process very fluid amidst virtually endless circumstances that may arise in the technically inclined business place 
len ratingfive Thanks for the great tool MS ur growing back to that place of prominence in my opinion 
len ratingfive Keep at it
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Very efficient and no issues keeping in touch with colleagues on various projects 
len ratingthree Strong features 
len ratingthree Good UI 
len ratingthree Notifications need some work sometimes they notify sometimes they don t 
len ratingthree If not attending an accepted meeting you get notified by all the messages in chat during that meeting for each message silent mode doesn t work in that case either 
len ratingthree In Teams message boards needs to be more customizable 
len ratingthree Specifically regarding order of messages 
len ratingthree i e 
len ratingthree most recent up top 
len ratingthree All in all a very good start to a platform by Microsoft 
len ratingfive Its a great upgrade over Skype 
len ratingfive And well connected 
len ratingfive Great for small or big organizations 
len ratingfive Calls Meh Everything Else 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive We previously used Skype and it was fine 
len ratingfive The file sharing capability alone makes it a perfect work sharing tool 
len ratingthree I really wish the Team s app would allow me to add Planner or other apps to the Team s page 
len ratingthree Also in planner it would be great if we could make project milestones and then team member commitments off each milestone with roll up data to show who s making commitments 
len ratingthree That would great to integrate with Power BI as an overview to multiple teams and or projects 
len ratingfive Seems too cool intuitive and easy to use for a Microsoft app 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive I like the ability to attach files that can be edited by group members 
len ratingfive And I love the numerous selection of GIFS and stickers 
len ratingfive This app works well and has never crashed on me 
len ratingfive Despite my every effort to set notifications as banner and persistent on my Apple phone I still struggle to get notification when files are added and certain sub Teams add comments Therefore I have to go hunting for them 
len ratingfive This is a huge inconvenience and my delay in response conveys to my teammates and boss that I don t care 
len ratingfive Just to clarify I have followed each thread specifically and have also gone into my settings on my iphone to allow all notifications from Teams 
len ratingfive Beyond that the functionality speed and intuition of app are excellent for my team s needs 
len ratingfive Large resort business with dozens of managers on Team 
len ratingfive Please provide low ram option
len ratingfive Ive used Slack 
len ratingfive It s not nearly as great as Teams 
len ratingfive Yes Slack has more I refractions 
len ratingfive However Teams is built on the SharePoint platform which is a fundamental need for any business 
len ratingfive Teams enables my distributed workforce to work well together despite time zones and distance 
len ratingfour Great tool the iOS version is dependable 
len ratingfour Sometimes more than the macOS version 
len ratingthree I like Teams a lot but the locking of channels is a must and not just inside the site but for adding those from outside 
len ratingfour Like it but difficult to multitask and be on a call while viewing other parts of teams
len ratingfive  better sound quality than Skype ability to add files and meeting notes to the meeting thread and share even with those did not attend the meeting edit Microsoft document with others in a centralized location no need to download an attachment from the email edit it and then re attach it by email
len ratingfour I believe in this that participation makes for a better team as far as acknowledging that there is a Teams and open communication helps with knowledge and getting the work done if everybody would use this accordingly Basically we all work together used teams like it s meant in our company things get done a lot better people can see what other people have written and say hey I might have a tip to help you with that situation get everybody on the same page get the work done and go home safe
len ratingfive This app makes life so much easier 
len ratingfive Going to meet ups and organising these with Teams app is such a breeze 
len ratingfive All your chats meetings Office documents One Note documents and more are at one place and organized 
len ratingfive Kudos to the Microsoft for such a great product 
len ratingfour Overall this app is easy to use but I can t figure out the notifications which seem inconsistent 
len ratingthree Two of the sections of teams work really well but several other sections and I manage files that have been shared and have you work
len ratingone Constantly crashes on iOS when you tap on new conversation 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingone We had submitted a fix to the store for this issue some time back 
len ratingone Can you please confirm the build version that you are using under Hamburger gt Settings gt About 
len ratingone Thanks again for the feedback 
len ratingfive We use several features of Teams at work but one feature I never knew existed came in handy yesterday when I lost my cell phone 
len ratingfive I was able to call team members using the call chat feature from my laptop which was really helpful 
len ratingone Text entry in chat is astoundingly broken on iOS 
len ratingone Has been broken for months 
len ratingone Seriously please fix this 
len ratingone It s impossible to type within the Teams app 
len ratingone The app is fundamentally unusable 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingone We had submitted a fix to the store for this iOS specific issue some time back 
len ratingone Can you please confirm the build version that you are using under Hamburger gt Settings gt About 
len ratingone Thanks again for the feedback 
len ratingfour It would be stars if we could actually delete the coversations
len ratingthree Good app for business needs high performance and so on but there are two things I hate 
len ratingthree Not possible to quote 
len ratingthree It take a long time for texts to appear when you scroll up 
len ratingone After upgrading to ios Teams crashes when I tap the New Conversation button in a team conversation 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingone We had submitted a fix to the store for this issue some time back 
len ratingone Can you please confirm the build version that you are using under Hamburger gt Settings gt About 
len ratingone Thanks again for the feedback 
len ratingfive I find myself using Slack less and less for internal communication 
len ratingfive The mobile app meeting functionality is really impressive 
len ratingfive The video audio and screen sharing is great 
len ratingfive Fast high quality simple 
len ratingfive Attending meeting pinging colleagues sharing content video and screen is so simple 
len ratingfive Everything is awesome when you re part of a Team 
len ratingone I updated to version and now I m not receiving notifications for Teams despite all settings being correct 
len ratingone My coworker tested this as well by just updating her app and her notifications completely stopped 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive It is a great way to contact staff and other coworkers
len ratingfive It would be good to get an alert on the phone like we do with text messages
len ratingfour Need ability to leave voice messages and make external calls 
len ratingfour Title says it all 
len ratingfour Cheers 
len ratingfive This is literally just a mix of google classroom and discord 
len ratingtwo When using team in my computer I cannot search from my list of contacts easily 
len ratingtwo It s needs to be quicker 
len ratingtwo Also when I select a person to speak with it does not place the curser into the dialogue box 
len ratingtwo This needs to be fixed immediately 
len ratingtwo Everyone this is really bad
len ratingfive Hi I just wanted the app to load faster than it does
len ratingfour It s quite boxy but I feel like if some things are rounded edges it will feel more relaxing to use or if the buttons you are about to press would slightly pop out or have a shadow showing more interactive display kinda like insta or gmail on iPhone 
len ratingfour It is pretty cool to use tho
len ratingthree Does not support multiple time zones for global teams 
len ratingthree Staffhub does and yet this does not 
len ratingthree This problem has also been addressed in multiple MS Teams forums but still no updates to fix this 
len ratingfive  by a factor of two 
len ratingtwo Our business uses iPod touches th and th gen for internal communication 
len ratingtwo This app s notification button for Always Allow when busy at your desk just freezes the app 
len ratingfive Brilliant app very easy to use 
len ratingone Hi gang 
len ratingone I can t get the notifications section to permit any changes 
len ratingone The screen won t even scroll 
len ratingone Tried uninstalling and reinstalling 
len ratingone Please address and I ll gladly give you a 
len ratingtwo I have to always go into the app to check if any changes are made to my shifts 
len ratingtwo App crashes when i enable things in settings 
len ratingtwo Microsoft get your ish together
len ratingfive  Keeps getting better and better 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work Microsoft thank you 
len ratingtwo No problems with the app 
len ratingtwo Problem lies in constant begging to rate the app and turn on notifications etc 
len ratingfive Easy way to organize your conversations meetings and projects 
len ratingfour Awesome other than you can t delete anything or change document titles 
len ratingfour Not five stars cause let s be honest it s for work and we all hate work shenanigans on our phones 
len ratingfour Love this application 
len ratingfour Anyone know how I can permanently delete a chat thread 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingfive Great from iPhone and my desktop 
len ratingfour Nice way to communicate
len ratingfour In general I like teams 
len ratingfour It is one of the best things we have adopted in our office 
len ratingfour It s too bad it doesn t play nice with Apple devices 
len ratingfour I have problems with the planner and calendar 
len ratingfour So I don t use either when using my phone or iPad 
len ratingfour Otherwise this is a pretty good app 
len ratingone I barely get this bloatware working on my MacBook so I wasn t very hopeful installing this on my my iPhone 
len ratingone Sure enough it keeps on giving me an inexplicable sign in error preventing me from using it at all on my phone 
len ratingone If you can use slack instead 
len ratingfour Someone needs to start thinking about simplicity in design 
len ratingfour Please please please look at telegram messenger using it is so intuitive 
len ratingthree More fluid and better designed than the iterations of Skype really needs Apple Watch support to make it sing 
len ratingfive Lags a bit but all in all great mobile app 
len ratingfour We are just getting started but will eventually have teams 
len ratingfour I really need a way to group related teams into categories and expand or contract those categories to maneuver much more quickly 
len ratingfour If you could define users at the channel level it would serve my purpose 
len ratingthree You can make the user interface more better and notify when someone is available and Away instantly instead of changing it after mins 
len ratingfour It works perfectly fine but if there is sun issues it goes really south 
len ratingfour I had cases where the chat comes to mobile and if I respond using desktop still the response would come only to mobile 
len ratingfour So it s like I use different devices to have one conversation 
len ratingfour And if password changes mobile does not accept new password or won t even ask type new password 
len ratingfour It keeps erroring 
len ratingfive Awesom
len ratingfive It is pleasant fast and an effective business collaboration tool 
len ratingfive I love this App for its ability to keep me and my IT TEAM connected 
len ratingfive We can make quick calls and this is one of the options that we have for internal calls at the company that I work for 
len ratingfive Awesome app
len ratingfive Emailing coworkers on small things takes forever as does opening up apps to get simple things from them 
len ratingfive A lot of apps have basic things that use mostly use them for 
len ratingfive Teams brings in my calendar allows me to make calls message my teemates look at the organizational structure and so many more useful things 
len ratingfour Notifications need some work 
len ratingfour DND setup is cumbersome 
len ratingfive It s nice to have all of the information you need right in one workspace converse whenever you need and pull everything all together 
len ratingfive The mobile app is just as easy to use 
len ratingfive It does it all 
len ratingfive Chat function is a bit difficult to use since chat with each person or in a call doesn t open in a new window 
len ratingthree Teams apps has many features but consumes more RAM memory
len ratingone I m currently using this app at school and it is full of bugs that don t let me turn anything in doesn t let you go on one note is super slow and makes it hard for me and my teachers 
len ratingone I don t recommend this app at all
len ratingfour Please add the inline translation piece to the mobile app 
len ratingfour Then I would make this star 
len ratingfour It s helping me a lot
len ratingfive We are transitioning to Team from Skype for Business and find Teams vastly superior in terms of ease of use and productivity 
len ratingfive Somehow it s inducing easy flowing chat convo and has not revealed a single annoyance like searching for team mates and not finding them on top of the results list 
len ratingfive I appreciate being to connect to so many people in my work network 
len ratingfive If it s something urgent I don t have to track down phone numbers or wait for someone to check their email 
len ratingfive I also like being able to include people into conversations instantaneously 
len ratingfive MS Teams has taken meetings to the next level 
len ratingfive So cool 
len ratingfive The best communication and collaboration tool
len ratingfive It s been incredible to have an app bring all of what happens in teams together 
len ratingfive You couldn t have named it better 
len ratingfour On Windows Desktop this app is perfection 
len ratingfour Everything is all brought into one hub with no fractured issues 
len ratingfour It all ties in perfectly 
len ratingfour Unfortunately on iOS it s really fractured 
len ratingfour I have to install all Office apps to use things fluidly but that s with a lot of app hopping 
len ratingfour It s nice that Planner is seperated out because I don t want all Employees using Teams 
len ratingfour They only need to preform tasks 
len ratingfour Teams on iOS it s not as straight forward as the Windows Desktop version 
len ratingfour It s also not as feature rich as the WinDT version 
len ratingfour Planner also not as feature rich as WinDT 
len ratingfour Other than that it s core purpose organizing collaboration and communication are on point 
len ratingfive The integration part allows me to deal with work drama in bed on my iPad 
len ratingfive Excellent 
len ratingone I have pictures on my phone from a workshop that need to be uploaded to our teams site why is this basic functionality still missing from the app 
len ratingfive Teams made my life so easy 
len ratingfive I can call video call share files message all on the go and real time with excellent quality 
len ratingfive Strongly recommend it if you are Trying to stay connected when work responsibilities take you AwaY from your desk
len ratingfive Phone app is great 
len ratingfive Desktop sometimes need to be refreshed to see current chats
len ratingfive We use this as our go to and for a start up ISP communication is key 
len ratingfive Conversations are easily tracked and kept up with 
len ratingfour Would love to be able to clear my complete conversations
len ratingfive Having this app and having it connected to my work streams makes my overall life so much easier 
len ratingfive I can instantly access items while away from my laptop and move projects forward no matter where I am 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingthree Specifically I don t see an option to cancel a call when someone is calling me over teams so I have to let it ring teams assumes that I am using Microsoft Authenticator for my Teams account nd factor and after my corporate credentials rotation it becomes a pain opens up the wrong nd factor app without giving you options of which and it has a plenty of glitches in the UX flow re authenticating with Symantec VIP factor even though you manage make it work after fighting with it for a couple of minutes
len ratingfive It has all features along with intuitive user interface 
len ratingfive I m just glad to finally have my mobile desktop apps in real time sync with each other 
len ratingfive Skype for Business never did 
len ratingfive Teams for the win 
len ratingfive Finally a one stop tool for productivity 
len ratingfive Easy to share documents prepare Checklists chat screen share call and video for real time collaboration 
len ratingfive Way to go Microsoft 
len ratingfive Best partnership tool EVER 
len ratingfive Hopefully Microsoft will develop this functionality soon 
len ratingtwo Compared to StaffHub the Shifts interface is inconvenient and difficult to use 
len ratingtwo It has been nearly impossible to get my team to use it consistently as they rarely receive notifications despite having them all turned on 
len ratingtwo As a result we often have shifts going uncovered until the very last minute when a manager has to jump in 
len ratingtwo We ve even began messaging in addition to opening or offering shifts in hopes of triggering some sort of notification to no avail 
len ratingtwo I will admit that I do find the desktop version more user friendly than the mobile but that is useless in a fast paced ever changing work environment 
len ratingtwo I have faith that it could be improved by making Shifts more easily accessible perhaps from the bottom menu creating a badge number to indicate when there are open shifts requests and improving the reliability of notifications 
len ratingtwo Fingers crossed that improvements will come soon 
len ratingfour Teams is a very good application for internal communication 
len ratingfour The phone and meeting functions are finicky 
len ratingfour Sometimes I have to login twice to get it to work 
len ratingfour Sometimes it works without logging in saved login info is working correctly 
len ratingone Make this available for iOS users 
len ratingfive  We can provide ASO service such as keywords ranking pushing rating and reviews so as to active user installs Visit us at upmobi xyz Every one can get a free promotion for days now 
len ratingfive Way better than Skype for business
len ratingfive Besides the lack of custom emojis this is a great messaging app 
len ratingfive It has completely replaced Slack at my company 
len ratingfive Developers aren t so happy about it 
len ratingfive But overall it does its job 
len ratingfive Just not as fun to use
len ratingfour Love it but I would like to be able to share multiple screens at once
len ratingfive This app works great for keeping in touch with everyone within my workplace with ease 
len ratingone  Text entry in chat window super broken 
len ratingfour He te ido mensajes aguardando y no los he abierto porque no me ha aparecido el n mero que indica qu hay un mensaje nuevo 
len ratingfour Cuando entro a la aplicaci n para utilizarla me topo con mensajes nuevos aguardando por mi 
len ratingfive The app works like a charm 
len ratingfive This app works great it allows my team to share information and stay connected 
len ratingfive Can t wait till I can figure out the shifts portion
len ratingthree Gentralises all communication however there are still some awkward features that need major improvement such as group management and OneDrive integration 
len ratingthree Basically there are too many separate apps 
len ratingthree This should be simplified 
len ratingfive Teams makes it easy to cut the internal emails down to almost zero and it s easier than texting since all our files convo history and more are in one place 
len ratingfive Looking forward to future improvements per the Uservoice forum from the MS team 
len ratingfour It would be nice to be able to share the mobile device s screen to help troubleshoot 
len ratingfour Fix the lag issue and you can have stars 
len ratingtwo Slack for old people 
len ratingfive Two separate systems cannot be live without completely signing out ugh 
len ratingfour It would be nice to be able to text back and forth with people whom we share our phone with
len ratingfive Works great
len ratingfive Teams is amazing especially when you learn Planner OneNote OneDrive and SharePoint 
len ratingfive Everything works seamlessly inside Teams 
len ratingfive Makes our entire organization work together while knowing what we re all doing together sharing files notes setting tasks 
len ratingfive Actually it s been fun to use it 
len ratingfive And there are pre recorded webinars to learn 
len ratingfive Well done Microsoft 
len ratingfour I really like teams 
len ratingfour The only reason I did not give stars is because it does not retain phone number history for meetings 
len ratingfour And there is no way to switch audio from computer to phone or vice versa in a meeting without leaving the meeting and rejoining 
len ratingfive Teams is a game changer for my small business 
len ratingfive The app and desktop platform allow my team to communicate quickly both individually and in groups 
len ratingfive I also use the teams to share updates and save articles write notes and schedule meetings 
len ratingfive It s literally and all in one business tool that I m not sure how I survived without 
len ratingfive Definitely recommend it for small business teams 
len ratingfive  Easy way to communicate between teams
len ratingfour Needs ability to clear delete conversations 
len ratingfour Phone calls Connections are clugy at times meaning you start a call but none of the controls work 
len ratingfour If called party answers the mic or speakers don t work properly 
len ratingfour  Overall teams is a good app however my assignments are not showing up in the assignments tab only activities
len ratingfour Please add ability to load files from mobile to file tab
len ratingthree  Please help me understand how such an unremarkable clunky app has such a high rating 
len ratingthree It s fine 
len ratingthree It s not Slack but it s fine 
len ratingfour Except for meeting notifications 
len ratingfour Would be nice if meetings scheduled with Teams could be configured to send an email alert via Outlook not sure why I randomly had no alert in either Outlook or Teams this morning was NOT in Airplane mode Do Not Disturb etc 
len ratingfive Voice mail tab missing for voip users
len ratingtwo I have used up all my data on my GB cell plan the last months because of teams 
len ratingtwo If I could disable the video that wouldn t happen 
len ratingtwo I use it for a team meeting every morning for minutes 
len ratingtwo Audio is all I need 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingfive Teams app s that thing 
len ratingfive  Best platform ever work place communications 
len ratingone Spend the money on slack 
len ratingone You won t be sorry
len ratingfive I can send patient info to staff in our office to get questions issues more quickly resolved 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Always connected to get business done
len ratingfour The only thing that the app is missing is a search option within a user 
len ratingfour When I do a search the app only searches for user 
len ratingone Microsoft continuous to attempt to consolidate their various office functionality in a more collaborative environment using cloud technology as the basic storage distribution platform 
len ratingone However the design of TEAMS software is so incredibly poor that using it is not only frustrating but also makes individuals quite unproductive 
len ratingone Teams essentially looks like a OneNote application integrating storage real time communication and basic folder organizing capabilities 
len ratingone However this quickly thrown together tools do not make teams more productive 
len ratingone It is at best a location where everybody can dump his her stuff into a common place 
len ratingone There is no flow no prioritization no transparency on what is currently ongoing 
len ratingone Unless you are constantly addicted to this tool and know every entry that is going on good luck finding anything or catching up 
len ratingone I found TEAMS software to be completely inadequate for productivity improvements of teams 
len ratingone This space awaits a true break through innovation beyond chats folders and tabs 
len ratingthree What s there works great but there are features missing in the app from the desktop version 
len ratingthree No ability to upload documents or create new folders is hindering 
len ratingfour To be honest I ve had daunting expertise with MSFT products with an exception of office suite 
len ratingfour However MS Teams seem to be evangelizing the overall outlook by the product and customer experience 
len ratingfour I give it four because I still see Slack on the forefront 
len ratingfour Way to go 
len ratingfour There should be a way to reply to specific messages even in for regular chats 
len ratingfour Please make that available as soon as possible 
len ratingfive I enjoy how accessible TEAMS is for me 
len ratingfive The mobile app is very easy to use
len ratingone  Poop
len ratingfour I really enjoy Teams on my iPhone 
len ratingfour Only thing missing is the ability to use cellular instead of a data connection when making a pp call 
len ratingfour Would will give it stars when that exists 
len ratingthree I love this app as it keeps me connected to my team but there are many times I miss pings from colleagues in different time zones and having a complication or even notifications on my Apple Watch would make a world of difference 
len ratingfive I just stated using Teams last week so still a novice 
len ratingfive But I have used BaseCamp and Jira at other companies 
len ratingfive I really like the full integration with Office 
len ratingfive We use it at Shutterfly and it works great for conference calling team chatting and file sharing 
len ratingfive Channels help our collaboration stay organized by topics 
len ratingfive Can t live without it 
len ratingfour Voice chat system needs a ton of work 
len ratingfour Can hardly here the initiator of a team call voices go in and out to the point of sounding underwater or cutting out completely 
len ratingfive I love Teams UX excellent sound crisp and clear 
len ratingfive We just started using teams at work and it s made such a difference in a positive way in how we communicate and get information across the board 
len ratingfive The more we learn about it the more we love it 
len ratingfive One of the very few good tools that I have ever used is the MS Teams 
len ratingfive I wish I could use this to setup regular meetings but unfortunately from our organization we are blocked from doing so 
len ratingfive Anyway this definitely is a replacement for Skype for me without a doubt 
len ratingfive So I definitely recommend it 
len ratingfive Teams is a great app For fast connectivity with colleagues Calling features are great The files menu is nice
len ratingfour The app is great overall however when video is connected through another device the Teams Chat Meetings Phone bar across the bottom is no longer visible 
len ratingfour Additionally the app could use the ability to do Picture in Picture mode and keep the camera on while in the smaller window similar to FaceTime this would allow me to take notes code while having a video chat with coworkers 
len ratingfour Lastly the alerts from webhook allow reactions on the desktop app but those are not visible on the mobile version 
len ratingfour I use this for tracking events that need action of supervisor approvals 
len ratingfour Would be nice to have this visibility when away from my laptop
len ratingone My class uses this app super difficult to use couldn t get the work don t because of how difficult it was to manage the app 
len ratingone Would not recommend
len ratingfive best app ever even better than skype alot
len ratingthree  Audio didn t work during a call last week Also the editing with each other doesn t work
len ratingfive Easy to access content on phone and on other devices 
len ratingfive It would be good if you add feature to reply to the particular msg like in WhatsApp 
len ratingfive Best user interface experience from MS Office Suite 
len ratingfive Sometimes too well I can t be away anymore 
len ratingfour  The app is great overall however when video is connected through another device the Teams Chat Meetings Phone bar across the bottom is no longer visible 
len ratingfour Additionally the app could use the ability to do Picture in Picture mode and keep the camera on while in the smaller window similar to FaceTime this would allow me to take notes code while having a video chat with coworkers 
len ratingthree Love the app for keeping in touch with co workers 
len ratingthree However since Staff hub was replaced by shift which is built into Teams I no longer get notifications when my shift is about to start 
len ratingthree This is a problem since at my company shifts very from week to week and there is no easy way to integrate the shifts into my calendar on my phone 
len ratingthree This is a good app but there is definitely room for improvement 
len ratingone Even though desktop app lets me do it and we have enabled external users in admin iOS app doesn t let us add 
len ratingone Complains user not found when we enter their email address please fix 
len ratingone If you need to reproduce the bug please email 
len ratingfive I work in sales so my email inbox is everything to me 
len ratingfive The problem is keeping it clear and up to date so nothing gets by me or delayed 
len ratingfive One challenge is internal communications clogging my inbox 
len ratingfive Being copied on emails that are only marginally relevant or worse the hi five email where a colleague gets a win on a deal and one word congratulations emails with a stupid GIF with Leonardo DiCaprio s giving a martini toast 
len ratingfive Coming flooding in 
len ratingfive Recently we deployed teams at my company 
len ratingfive At first I had no idea how to use teams or what it was for 
len ratingfive A few YouTube videos I had an epiphany it keeps internal communications out of my inbox and it helps me organize all of the information meeting notes proposals contracts about my book of business organized 
len ratingfive Now we have channels aligned to recent wins where managers give praise and other reps can share a Leo roar 
len ratingfive I have made channels for each one of my accounts where all my files and information is organized and saved with integrations for things like OneNote PowerPoint Excel Word YouTube and hundred of others 
len ratingfive I have already ventured into using teams with my clients who also use teams as a shared workspace and platform for projects and initiatives we are working on together 
len ratingfive We shared instant messages on issues that pop up through out the day we share information with each other and best of all it makes a warm intro to a new contact incredibly easy and vetted 
len ratingfive Teams is easily the biggest break through Microsoft has had since PowerPoint and Excel 
len ratingfive  Brendan H 
len ratingfive More Emojis and GIFS and creative input for users more customization to messages sent different screen FX 
len ratingfive When you send a message it takes over user screen like fireworks or other things like scenes from movies or things you can make with presets 
len ratingfive There teams interface displays with sound 
len ratingfive Also video games to play with other teams users 
len ratingfive Also simple card games and others 
len ratingfive Just some cool inputs 
len ratingfive Amazing for work communication Saves whole lot of time
len ratingfour It needs better notification options 
len ratingfour Would like the option to have banner notifications for unread messages only not just all messages read and unread or no messages
len ratingfour It s great other than the fact we can t creTe copies of Planner when using the plugin from Teams any chance this will happen soon 
len ratingfour This will determine if our pilot is a success or not for our national team 
len ratingfive I like the new app it is very user friendly 
len ratingfive Love how it allows our team to communicate via the App 
len ratingfive  This is my opinion not that of my employer 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Chat 
len ratingfive Video 
len ratingfive Screen sharing 
len ratingfive Voice 
len ratingfive Works well as long as you have a great Wi Fi connection 
len ratingfive I have all of them on my iPhone and use them as my job requires 
len ratingfive This one is stars 
len ratingfive I m in IT so I really appreciate when an app has good interface 
len ratingfive This is a GREAT application if you can get your whole team to use it 
len ratingfive Even comes with a wiki for you to add documentation 
len ratingfive  The app is easy to use and works seamlessly with my desktop app 
len ratingfive Never miss a meeting again 
len ratingfour The only reason not giving star due to I can not share only channel 
len ratingfour Lacking some basic chatting features for example I can t responde by quoting another person s message that is something basic 
len ratingfive It make the conf calls so easy
len ratingfour Please continue to Expand the features 
len ratingfour Will Skype Features be rolled into teams but with much better video And collaboration tools 
len ratingfive I love it and it is easy to use 
len ratingfive Teams helps my colleagues and I work effectively and stay in great communication 
len ratingfive Great business tool 
len ratingfour Single point of entry 
len ratingfour Lots of add ins 
len ratingfour Collaborative 
len ratingfour Still need to polish the multi group connectivity utilization of voice 
len ratingfour App is user friendly 
len ratingfour Thank you for giving us multiple user accounts on one app 
len ratingone Does not function at all on iPad 
len ratingone Very annoying since this is made by Microsoft 
len ratingfour This is a great collaboration product extending office capability 
len ratingfour It can be even better if audio quality is improved and interruption when switching between WiFi and Cellular network is avoided 
len ratingfour Dial out for audio can be improved as well 
len ratingone Wait till version comes out 
len ratingfive I really like this app giving great satisfaction
len ratingone Why are my teams calls popping up when the app is closed and getting saved to my call log 
len ratingone Why can t I disable this feature 
len ratingfour My only criticism is the inability to add files from mobile 
len ratingfour Otherwise this app has been a godsend 
len ratingfour As a field based team with a rapidly changing service schedule and a need to share reference files regarding customers there hasn t a better solution than the hodgepodge email Box text until this 
len ratingfour Any chance there could be some sort of integration w To Do 
len ratingfive This Teams thing Is going to be career and life changing for me and my world 
len ratingfive Microsoft has been professional standard so not surprised
len ratingthree Still learning how to use it 
len ratingthree I feel like it s not as simple as I wish it was 
len ratingthree But maybe I m just ignorant 
len ratingfive  Review Optional 
len ratingfour I wish there were a facility for a to do list
len ratingfive I am only now with usage beginning to see how valuable Teams can be 
len ratingfive I under appreciated it and am excited to fully implement it 
len ratingfour Wish this had a built in tutorial that guides first time users on how to use and set up all the features 
len ratingone If you are using office products you know that your are eternally beta testing for microsoft and Teams may be the most unreliable app of them all 
len ratingone Try using calls or share for a live meeting I dare you 
len ratingone Nothing works 
len ratingfour My biggest complaint is that I have to go into the settings to log out 
len ratingfour I would expect to be able to log out from the same location where I can change my status 
len ratingfour Overall the app has worked out well for my needs 
len ratingfive Ever since I downloaded Microsoft Teams I ve been using it to communicate and coordinate with my team 
len ratingfive I love how simple and fluid the interface is and I especially love how quickly everything works 
len ratingfive I d highly recommend this application to any team looking for better real time collaboration and communication 
len ratingfive The Microsoft Team absolutely reinvented collaborative efforts 
len ratingfive From quick chats replacing short emails instant video conferencing screen sharing changing control of screen share to easily accessed folders and docs 
len ratingfive Teams truly fosters greater communication among coworkers 
len ratingfive Well Done 
len ratingfive This application allows me to network with my coworkers faster and a sure business operations are maintained throughout their crazy business day 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfour  Everything is good with the app except one thing that is when I send smilie emoticon on desktop app it is showing laughing emoticon on mobile app for the recipient 
len ratingfour Please get it fixed to avoid miscommunication between team mates 
len ratingfour  Can t see student work in assignment In android version there is no review button to mark student work 
len ratingfive Thanks teams 
len ratingfour Teams is good but is is missing the ability to select someone s reply and be able to quote and reply to it like WhatsApp 
len ratingfour Please make this happen 
len ratingfive Simple Easy that s all
len ratingfour Most of the time search results take me to the wrong conversation line
len ratingfive Teams is wonderful for working with well teams 
len ratingfive I use it at my work for everything from casual almost business talk to serious collaboration on projects 
len ratingfive I also use it for recreational groups within the company and outside of work with friends 
len ratingfive That said if you only wanna use Teams as an alternative to say GroupMe it s too much 
len ratingfive You won t use any of the features and it ll probably get in the way 
len ratingfour The app is great for group communication and meetings too 
len ratingfour I wish there was a way to turn off notifications for individual group chats or teams 
len ratingfour It s all or none as far as I can figure out 
len ratingfive This app allows us to communicate within our office securely 
len ratingfive It improves workflow and increases productivity 
len ratingfive Great improvements 
len ratingfive It s great to be able to use with the Microsoft office suite 
len ratingfive  Hello I loved teams a lot compared to lync 
len ratingfive Can you add car play feature to this that would be really great to attend the meetings when you are driving the car 
len ratingfive Thanks Harish 
len ratingfive Would love to have your list of featured contacts 
len ratingfour I find the teams app an informative tool and a good way to communicate to my fellow techs in the field and the offices 
len ratingfour Thanks for the info 
len ratingfour  There needs to be a note taking section for this app 
len ratingfour If OneNote is going away then the organized notebook like features need to be available in this app 
len ratingfive I can be loafing around in Starbucks while answering work mates questions 
len ratingfive That s worth its weight in sweet monkey lov n 
len ratingone Use Slack 
len ratingone This app was unreliably slow 
len ratingone Trying to search for conversations or docs takes WAY too much time in an era where this should be instantaneous 
len ratingone Skype is also frustrating to use and can often loose connection 
len ratingfive This product is used extensively in our organization and it is easy to use 
len ratingone People send links to various things inside Teams like files or folders 
len ratingone These links take you to Safari only to get browser not supported download app But there is no way to force that link to open in the app 
len ratingone You can t even paste it into the app 
len ratingone We miss Box 
len ratingfive It s a work in progress but for feature parity it gets it right 
len ratingfour Awesome slack competitor 
len ratingfour Especially for Microsoft users 
len ratingfour Still needs a dark mode and some better formatting for messages that allow for code with colors and other formats 
len ratingfour The chat functionality is great 
len ratingfour The teams portion could use help 
len ratingfour It s still not where it needs to be 
len ratingfour It s basically a group chat instead of community board 
len ratingfour Things can still get lost in the noise 
len ratingfour But its awesome and the improvements I ve seen make me excited for what s to come 
len ratingfive With the integration of StaffHub coming soon this is really becoming an amazing collaborative application 
len ratingfive Kudos too the amazing Microsoft Team WinPhan
len ratingfive The app works great and streamlines communication between my team and me when I am on the road 
len ratingfive The tool works well on my smart phone and on my laptop 
len ratingfive It has so many capabilities 
len ratingfive I am very pleased to say that finally you got it right 
len ratingfive It was about time 
len ratingfive You can take over the communications market with this app 
len ratingfive Too bad it is blocked in China 
len ratingfive I have conference calls every week with China and have to use their YY app 
len ratingfive Please keep up the good work 
len ratingfive I am finally managing my team effectively 
len ratingfive I can keep people accountable and respond to my various departments fast and easy 
len ratingfive Very powerful for business and volunteer orgs 
len ratingfive It s especially good for ongoing conversations 
len ratingfive Great office communicator
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone This has been a total nightmare 
len ratingone Once I wrongfully selected the wrong account type there s no way for me to login 
len ratingone I tried every attempt including deleting the app and clearing the cache 
len ratingone  Like every other piece of software from Microsoft this is once again complete and utter trash 
len ratingone Have to use it occasionally for a few ignorant clients dumb enough to completely overpay for Microsoft s services 
len ratingthree It would be nice to be able to see what is written in when a preview goes to your email when you have teams off 
len ratingthree It would be nice for contacts to organize by the ones you talk to the most 
len ratingthree It would also be nice if teams would flash after someone messages you if you are away from your desk so it is seen when you get back 
len ratingthree  I like this app 
len ratingthree Easy to use 
len ratingthree Great integration with Office 
len ratingthree And love the functionality but strongly dislike all the purple 
len ratingthree Not pleasing to the eye 
len ratingthree Would be great to be able to customize the color theme 
len ratingthree Plus would love to see the option of reacting with emojis 
len ratingthree Better integration with Asana 
len ratingthree You can only add individual projects and there s no central place to see Asana notifications like you have in Slack 
len ratingthree Considering moving our team to this from Slack but would love to see a few of these changes happen 
len ratingthree It would be nice to have the ability to switch between multiple accounts very similar to Slack 
len ratingthree When working with multiple teams using different accounts there is no easy way to switch without logging off and back on 
len ratingthree When doing this the credentials get cached sometimes making it more difficult 
len ratingfour  Voice messages are not accessible from all devices Likewise they cannot recorded created from all devices A bit slow
len ratingfive I use this mainly for communication with colleagues at work 
len ratingfive The efficiency of the tool which can connect both laptop and iPhone seamlessly proved to be very useful 
len ratingfive It allows me and my tram to stay in close communication outside of the work Hours 
len ratingfive I ve used Collaboration softwares for the past two years 
len ratingfive The last four months I ve used Teams 
len ratingfive Our internal communication with a small team of people has moved from outlook to Teams exclusively 
len ratingfive It is so much more efficient as a manager to quickly review conversations in Teams than being cc d on a dozen emails for a topic I don t give input on but I still need to know about 
len ratingfive Very user friendly and I use it for everything 
len ratingtwo You would think such a simple thing as loading images wouldn t be a problem for a Microsoft
len ratingone  Just like every other piece of microsoft garbage it s worthless 
len ratingone In the age of teleworking and expectations to always be connected this app falls WAAAAAY short 
len ratingone Files shared within the app cannot be edited even when you copy or send it to another piece of crap microsoft app 
len ratingone For example I share and edit excel files within the desktop version of teams 
len ratingone In order to open and copy and paste within the app or make edits you have to save a copy to your phone 
len ratingone New updates are not merged 
len ratingone Way to streamline mircosoft 
len ratingone I wish my company would stop using your programs 
len ratingone SLACK IS WAY BETTER 
len ratingtwo I m logged in to the app on multiple devices on various OS none of which is Windows and the lag in syncing is so bad to the point of messing up the thread sequence 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive  I ve used Teams before and it s great 
len ratingfive An issue that I had with it is I had redownloaded and set up the app with my email account when I opened it I was asked for access for most of the normal things cell data contacts mic notifications but camera was not one of them 
len ratingfive I started a conference and was the only one who didn t have video and since I wasn t prompted for access to the camera it also didn t show up in the app settings or in Settings Privacy Camera Teams 
len ratingfive To grant access to the camera I had to terminate the call pull up on the little menu expander on the bottom and press Camera as if I was taking a photo then was prompted to grant access to the camera fixing my issue 
len ratingfive Please add the prompt to access the camera on first open or when also starting a call 
len ratingfive I would bet I m not the only one who had this issue 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Teams rocks 
len ratingfive I find the Team app very useful app for individua team or conference communication 
len ratingfive I don t understand why one can not delete the conversation on this app 
len ratingfive Other than that I find the tool and integration of it with other devices very useful intuitive and stable
len ratingfour Amazing integration of different applications 
len ratingfour Loving it
len ratingfive This app is amazing 
len ratingfive Great tool to communicate and get tasks accomplished 
len ratingfive Time saver 
len ratingfour  no editing of messages no way to tell if a recipient has seen a message this is a big weakness no reply to an individual message on a chat you can reply on a channel 
len ratingfive Teams supports strong collaboration 
len ratingfive Microsoft really outdid themselves with Teams 
len ratingthree  What happen to seeing who liked the comments 
len ratingthree It s seems that when there is an update one good comes in and one feature leaves 
len ratingthree Please make this feature available again 
len ratingthree  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingthree You can reveal the timestamps for individual messages using a left drag gesture on chat view 
len ratingthree We are following the same pattern as iMessage to make the experience more familiar for iOS users but thanks for the feedback and we wil
len ratingfive Perfect App 
len ratingone  Use slack 
len ratingone Teams is way back in terms of UX 
len ratingfive I like it real good 
len ratingfive Yup it be real nice 
len ratingfour  stars for having good call and meeting functionality but navigating is NOT very intuitive 
len ratingfour I m often most at how to get back to a certain thread meeting or especially a certain file 
len ratingone  Downloaded this off the app store to test against slack as I m new to both products 
len ratingone I was able to download and setup slack in no time and started using the app 
len ratingone Downloaded Microsoft teams and ran into all kinds of issues signing in when the code is sent to Authenticator to setup the work email you want to use and Authenticator popped up but kept getting error please try again later 
len ratingone I uninstalled after attempts 
len ratingtwo Please match up to slack 
len ratingtwo  Each message should have the timestamp 
len ratingtwo  The search needs to be better provide filter for date time sender and keywords Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingtwo While the timestamps on channel posts are always visible times stamps in chats can be viewed by swiping towards left to reveal the timestamps 
len ratingtwo This allows us to maximize space utilization for message content while at the same tim
len ratingfour Not quite as good as Slack but it is getting there 
len ratingfour  I ve used this weekly for over a year to lead a team of millennials 
len ratingfour They love it 
len ratingfour I love that it keeps us organized and everything is accessible 
len ratingfour Great program and great app 
len ratingfive Microsoft teams is very powerful 
len ratingfive I work in government lead people and create maintain software for divisions 
len ratingfive I have created multiple teams and channel for each division 
len ratingfive Knowledge and information sharing has increased tremendously 
len ratingfive It also has multiple cool apps integrations like wiki which can be used to document important information and planner which can be used to log and track tasks 
len ratingfive Go ahead and adopt teams it will improve your efficiency a lot 
len ratingthree notifications have trouble cleaning after reading 
len ratingthree Also submitting review could not be accomplished with folio keyboard required on screen keyboard 
len ratingfour Teams desktop and iOS app are a great start in the right direction for collaboration and consolidation 
len ratingfour Love the ability to click tap thru my calendar to a meeting or file 
len ratingfour I do think that it can use some help or o don t know how I m being able to jump between open content without walking the link chain 
len ratingfour Like give me an open tab bar and let me swap between active things 
len ratingone In settings you can restrict Teams ability to access your contacts list 
len ratingone I noticed today that Teams was continuing to access and sync my contacts including new contacts despite that I disabled that permission weeks ago 
len ratingfive Works well on iPhone no problems for me
len ratingfive  Finally a brilliant solution to a major problem we all face too many emails 
len ratingfive And better yet it slides on in to the Microsoft ecosystem which finally comes to life thanks the addition of Microsoft Teams allowing you to basically do everything you need from a single app 
len ratingfive You could essentially function without your computer as it can also interface with other known systems 
len ratingfive If you aren t sure what Teams is imagine if you took Outlook OneNote OneDrive and Skype Lync and rolled them all into one 
len ratingfive Amazingly simple and powerful very easy to pick up and learn on the fly 
len ratingfive Move out of individual data silos and into real time collaborative document review and editing 
len ratingfive This is the new standard communication of our times and it sees Outlook returning to its original purpose event and time management not real time communication 
len ratingfive So wave good bye to those group email replies you receive every day that have nothing to do with you and utilize your time focusing on what really matters 
len ratingfive There are many other benefits such as never again having a discussion or a meeting where something is mentioned but never actioned 
len ratingfive And other stand our features include ability to communicate with people within and external to your company all in the same place 
len ratingfive Simply put this is a must have app in today s world so do yourself a favor stop reading this install it and see what s it all about 
len ratingone One thing that seems to be constant across all platforms and products these days is that Microsoft can t get notifications right 
len ratingone The sporadic at best delivery of notifications from this app no matter how much effort I put into trying to ensure they re enabled guarantees the more important the message the less likely I am to see it 
len ratingtwo  Company switched over to this so I have to use it 
len ratingtwo Works OK for the most part but could be a lot better and how some things are organized 
len ratingtwo I did think it was a little dirty that it asks if you like the app and if you click yes Then you are redirected to the App Store to leave a review 
len ratingtwo How much do you want to bet that if you click no then it does not 
len ratingfour They are actively working on making it better 
len ratingfour Works really well 
len ratingfour Good and convenient but needs ability to load files directly to file structure sub folders via share point 
len ratingfour Big failing 
len ratingfive Teams allows a quicker way to communicate without using text or email 
len ratingfour Just don t try to send images that crashes the app on my even after reinstalls of both the app and iOS
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingone It s ridiculously easy to miss notifications leading to dropped conversations that require pinging 
len ratingone The app has some dumb logic which decides to randomly not make a sound or send a notification because your desktop was in use minutes ago 
len ratingone Slack works a lot better 
len ratingone Microsoft needs to focus on the basics not shovel in bots and enterprise PBX or other stuff before simple chat is fixed 
len ratingfive Microsoft did a really great job stealing this concept from Slack 
len ratingone After downloading Teams I turned off notifications because this is a secondary communication app for my team 
len ratingone Microsoft turned on notifications against my wishes 
len ratingone I d be interested to know what other things they don t care about users wishes 
len ratingthree  I want an option to send pictures or gifs
len ratingfive  This is a great tool for team collaboration and persistent chat 
len ratingfive Lots of great features included depending on your agreement E or E etc you may have more or less 
len ratingfive Good stuff 
len ratingfive Llamadas s per claras el compartir pantalla es un pro que permite las meets ser m s completas y eficaces 
len ratingthree I ve started using Teams for a nonprofit we have a stab at and it s growing quickly 
len ratingthree My only issue is really just trying to explain how to use it to others in and follow it through SharePoint 
len ratingthree The mobile app continues to shut down on me out of nowhere that s pretty annoying 
len ratingthree But other than that I have to figure out how to teach my team how to use it also with ease
len ratingfive Great job 
len ratingfive Makes my job easier 
len ratingfive gives me an excuse to send my boss memes woot woot
len ratingfour Still in the early learning stage 
len ratingfive This is one the coolest networking tools out for our company since we have multiple campuses 
len ratingfour Great work Teams team 
len ratingfour I use this app every day in my job and it s a critical tool for me 
len ratingfour I still would love to see the ability to share screen without being in a meeting and blur background on video chat I understand that this takes a lot of processing power to do and may drain your battery 
len ratingfour Now that I can add a Teams meeting from Outlook on iOS the value of these two apps together has increased 
len ratingfive Very easy to use love that you can reply without opening a new screen and share files super fast screen sharing is so useful 
len ratingtwo If you are an iPhone user you are going to be frustrated because the entire platform whether on Mac OS or iOS does not support safari 
len ratingtwo How in this day and age does someone build an iPhone app that doesn t allow you to connect natively to the web 
len ratingtwo Guess I m sticking with Zoom for meetings 
len ratingfive Haven t used the app long but so far it s going good 
len ratingfive I like the layout better than the desktop app
len ratingthree Our company recently migrated from Slack to Teams and I have to say Teams is not as good 
len ratingthree The big reason is the lack of customization 
len ratingthree For example in Slack I can mute specific channels so even if they are mentioned I won t get notified 
len ratingthree Team has no way to do this 
len ratingthree I joined a company support team and any time someone mentions a channel in that team I get a notification on my iPhone 
len ratingthree That s really annoying 
len ratingfive Nice communication tool for internal team members
len ratingfour My top gripe is the inability to partition access Channel by Channel 
len ratingfour I understand this is highly requested feature and is on roadmap for short term release 
len ratingfour Please let us know when this is coming 
len ratingfive  This application allows me to network with my coworkers faster and a sure business operations are maintained throughout their crazy business day 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingthree The look and feel is good but not great 
len ratingthree Needs some work 
len ratingthree What s up with no Apple Watch integration 
len ratingthree When is that happening 
len ratingfour I love it so grate and useful for active office 
len ratingfour Only one compline I couldn t make it to show the notifications on my phone s screen it would send me an email but not show on my screen anything new 
len ratingfour The app will show me badges 
len ratingfour I am not sure why 
len ratingfive I usually am sceptic when it comes to Microsoft surprises and most of them are not really pleasant 
len ratingfive This time with Teams I am happy to throw in high five for all work done on Teams 
len ratingfive I love both desktop and mobile version 
len ratingfive Oh almost forgot I am Apple user in both 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Simple indescribable but very pleasant surprise 
len ratingfive Thank you for Teams 
len ratingfive So easy and nice to use it s actually fun 
len ratingfive Love that you can t tell I m responding from mobile too 
len ratingfive Thanks Microsoft 
len ratingfive I am impressed by this application and how well it integrates project team members 
len ratingfive In edition the online collaboration with office files is now to a point of being usable 
len ratingfive We have had to people around the globe collaborate on one excel file during a brain storming session 
len ratingfive All at once 
len ratingfive Very impressive 
len ratingfive This app has been great for our small office and has really helped us cut down on some emails 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfour I still do grasp the full potential of Teams but I like it so far 
len ratingfour Need to implement timestamp and emoji in mobile ios version Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingfour We are working on improving emoji support but timestamps are already available in chats with a left swipe same as iMessages 
len ratingfour You can always can always reach us at with any issues or feedback 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive  Attending meeting pinging colleagues sharing content video and screen is so simple 
len ratingfive Only complain is the ability to create emojis and adding additional GIFs
len ratingfour Great collaboration app for my programming team just wish we could have more control over our own status 
len ratingfour Sometimes I m not always using my main machine and hate it that my status gets set to away automatically making others think I m not there 
len ratingfour Let us control if we are away or not 
len ratingfive It consistently locks my screen 
len ratingfive But the texting works well
len ratingfive Better than the desktop app 
len ratingfive Teams is so user friendly 
len ratingfive I basically work out of Teams all day 
len ratingfive Its awesome 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Makes field receipts easy too handle and track
len ratingfive Love that in the event of being late to a meeting that I can call in from my phone or iPad app works well and has all functionality of desktop
len ratingfour Pretty useful tool 
len ratingfour My company uses it to store architectural plans submittals job photos etc 
len ratingfour It would be nice if you could upload photos and files from your iPhone or iPad 
len ratingfour Also the app seems to struggle a little when trying to open large files that have been uploaded 
len ratingfive This is the best app for online collaboration and MS hit the right spot 
len ratingfive I am using it since 
len ratingfive This app is wonderful and work like a champ for team collaboration 
len ratingfive If you have team member all of the world then this is must have app for you 
len ratingfive I always prefer MS apps and they never disappoint me 
len ratingfive Same goes to MS teams 
len ratingfive It is a must have app for day to day work 
len ratingfive No matter how small or big work force you have but this should be the essential app for team 
len ratingfive Cheers 
len ratingfive MS 
len ratingthree  I like Team however I find it very limiting to only have one open window at a time each time we try to do activities we essentially step out and need to rejoin as opposed to shift views will this evolve 
len ratingfive Nothing to complain about on this app 
len ratingfive It s smooth integrates perfectly with the rest of Office and the call quality is generally excellent 
len ratingfive Pairing Teams channels with sharepoint is pretty nice 
len ratingfive Trying to explain how teams sharepoint and OneDrive work together to the end user is another story 
len ratingfive Keep your rollout documentation simple for them 
len ratingfive Make sure you explain how editing online works and the possible quarks if too many people edit at once 
len ratingfive Most users are use to having excel docs locked by other users 
len ratingfive They need to be informed if someone edits the same field their work can be overwritten 
len ratingfive Make sure you also back up your stuff before rolling out 
len ratingfive Microsoft protects their data not your data 
len ratingfour Microsoft has improved the chatting App with introduction of teams I still have difficult controlling keyboard when sharing screen on desktop app only mouse control works but not the keyboard
len ratingfour Teams is much easier to use than Skype for business 
len ratingfour Would like to see more integration with other apps such as outlook calendar and Planner 
len ratingfive It s a great app for companies that are running multiple projects in different locations 
len ratingfive It makes it easy to communicate which aids in making the project progress successful
len ratingfive This is hands down the best modern collaboration app for anyone 
len ratingfive It brings together all the best things of Microsoft and Office into a single client 
len ratingfive What s more is you can easily build custom tab apps that integrate with it 
len ratingfive Teams is the center of our modern collaboration strategy at work and will help to drive our digital Transformation 
len ratingfive Microsoft watched and learned from all the early offerings and knocked it out of the park 
len ratingfive If you re using Slack or Hipchat today you owe it to yourself to give Teams a honest evaluation 
len ratingthree This is an improvement from the predecessor especially in that it will notify you on apple products when someone messages 
len ratingthree However it is overly complicated with terms and structures that could be modified for simplicity 
len ratingthree Teams groups chats favorites and other terms that don t really make sense 
len ratingthree Also if calendar and one drive is there why not add email 
len ratingfive I am a very huge fan of Microsoft products however Teams has evolved into one of the best apps I ve used 
len ratingfive I think the mobile client is better than desktop 
len ratingfive Would love to see translation in it but love how everything I need is in one accessible app 
len ratingfive Need a way to delete messages to avoid clutter
len ratingfive Were it not for the fact that our customers need to call us and vice versa or say the occasional conference bridges we host for ourselves and third parties we wouldn t even need our phone system anymore as Teams meets all of our in house needs so well that it is our go to mode of calling instant messaging sharing files scheduling and managing meetings posting status updates etc 
len ratingthree The notifications are terrible 
len ratingthree We need the same granularity that we have with Skype for Business 
len ratingthree How hard can that be 
len ratingthree I have one ding that I cannot control in my Windows sounds 
len ratingthree This is untenable 
len ratingthree I love the product except for the lack of notification options 
len ratingfive Only issue is we can seem to change the sound of the notification 
len ratingfive Is there a way to change it to a louder sound 
len ratingfour I m really enjoying Teams is my small company 
len ratingfour I created my own webhooks and everything is automated 
len ratingfour Thank you for your hard work 
len ratingfour Though i have two problems with notifications 
len ratingfour  Sometimes i m not receiving any notification at all for a message 
len ratingfour Not in my MacBook Pro and not in my iPhone 
len ratingfour  There is no clear message in channel notifications 
len ratingfour For example i setup a uptime manager bot for alerting me but there is no brief message in my iPhone notification about what happend i have to touch it and see the message in the Teams 
len ratingfive Nice 
len ratingfive Easy installation and this app keeps up with all the conversation and links I add 
len ratingfive I love teams but the desktop footprint needs to be compacted to a similar initial footprint for the Skype for business client and then navigated like the teams app on my phone 
len ratingfive When that happens I won t even remember Skype email will become a legacy interface and teams will be the go to for collaboration and communications 
len ratingone It is so slow I was desperately trying to sign in and it just kept loading
len ratingfive Teams is hands down the best team communication app created 
len ratingfive There are so many features and uses for it 
len ratingfive Aside from being awesome it doesn t notify when it went to sleep for a long time
len ratingfour The only thing missing is integrating the one note features for meeting notes and to do list 
len ratingfour I need that in my life 
len ratingfour Otherwise this app is fast 
len ratingfour It will be challenging to get team to use this because people don t like changing their workflow 
len ratingfour Maybe push notifications on outlook and Skype about using teams 
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive Only thing I d like to see is more administrative control onky certain people can join teams and always have the admins have owner roles automatically 
len ratingfive Also would like to have a read receipt for posts and conversations to see if everybody is getting the messages to make sure they are fully understanding the new app 
len ratingfive Besides that our company is loving the implementation of the Teams App for our everyday work flow 
len ratingfive Company Communication is getting much better with the Teams App 
len ratingfive Tiene todo lo que necesita es multi device y tiene buen velocidad y calidad de voz y video
len ratingone  Really nothing more to say than that 
len ratingone The app is useless if you can t type in it 
len ratingfive Updates and integrations are good 
len ratingfive In Teams I really hope you ll soon be able to see other teams labor schedules in Shifts and be able to assign employees between teams for labor sharing 
len ratingfour  I would give this stars if teams wasn t such a CPU and RAM resource hog 
len ratingfour One of my favorite things about teams is the call quality 
len ratingfour Skype is absolutely awful and unreliable teams is always clear and connects immediately 
len ratingfour Integration of all MS products is long overdue 
len ratingfour Memory needs for the app are ridiculous this isn t a video game 
len ratingfour Keep improving and reduce system resource requirements 
len ratingfour My job uses Teams to communicate with and another and its very useful 
len ratingfour It connects with your Microsoft email which is useful 
len ratingfour This app represents big steps forward from Microsoft in their mobile products 
len ratingfour It still has some of the clunkiness and web feel but it s features are getting to where they should be 
len ratingthree Audio issues
len ratingfive I had some minor issue with fast forwarding videos in the app but other than that this Microsoft app is awesome it possesses every single function and feature I could have thought of to make my team work in a much more efficient fashion 
len ratingfive I m sure when Microsoft a large organization itself developed it they have these specific problems and solutions in head already 
len ratingfive It really deserves the name TEAM
len ratingfive It s easy to find all the options and you don t lose a bunch of functionality from not being on the desktop version 
len ratingtwo Ability to delete message Ability to delete members post Having private channel is a must Overall 
len ratingtwo Deleting things is required 
len ratingfour The private chnnel is a great add 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingfour Add more apps to them and I am sold on Teams 
len ratingfour I really like the app and it s very helpful at work 
len ratingfour The only thing I wish was different is an easier way to upload files from mobile devices 
len ratingfive Nice application to keep in contact with your work outside of the office
len ratingfive I work in the construction industry and we do not have many project management solutions that have been standardized across the industry 
len ratingfive I initially tried using OneNote for managing projects and my team found it to be too lethargic 
len ratingfive Later I added a new team member to the group and he immediately started using the teams app in our existing work group 
len ratingfive It caught on like wildfire and within a week my entire team of was using it 
len ratingfive The ease of file sharing instant communication task assignment wiki functions and compatibility with other apps has made us all wonder how we got along without it 
len ratingfive It solved many existing problems we had 
len ratingfive Now we just need to convince the rest of the company to get on board 
len ratingone  Too difficult to find and see contacts status 
len ratingfive This is a great App that allows us to connect with anyone in the company 
len ratingfive Also a great and easy way to get help from network communication departments or simply send a quick message to someone 
len ratingfive Live it
len ratingtwo  We need the option to mark messages as unread 
len ratingtwo Also the fact that I can t completely opt out of notifications is obtrusive 
len ratingtwo I check the app often throughout the day and have notifications off for better productivity 
len ratingtwo I don t need email notifications either 
len ratingtwo Why can t we opt out 
len ratingtwo So frustrating 
len ratingfour In typical MSFT fashion it isn t quite polished yet 
len ratingfour Voice quality could use work as well as network resiliency 
len ratingfour Very good start though 
len ratingfour I use the app daily for hours on end 
len ratingone MS teams is great on a desktop but on my phone it s absolutely worthless 
len ratingone Might just be the way my office has security configured on my work phone but every time Teams attempts to open Planer I have to sign in again 
len ratingone Planner is missing a lot of features that teams for desktop has 
len ratingone Mostly just not happy that you have to install several other apps that Teams switches to 
len ratingfive I am an IT support manager 
len ratingfive Teams has become our go to app for almost all of our collaboration needs 
len ratingfour Would be good if we could make it multi window easy to carry out multiple chats
len ratingfive Live the clarity and simplicity of the app 
len ratingfive Anytime and anywhere meeting love it 
len ratingfive My associates and I use this tool daily 
len ratingfive It s great for quick chats analyzing projects in large forums screen sharing conference calls video chats in small or large groups and document sharing 
len ratingfive It s a great tool for businesses and small offices alike 
len ratingfive Definitely pleased with Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive Excelent apps for web and mobile
len ratingfive I gave Teams a Star rating 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingtwo I prefer joining meeting from my phone as opposed to my desktop 
len ratingtwo The latest update makes it VERY difficult to find my meeting 
len ratingtwo Also there is no way to do an impromptu call of the app and share screen on the desktop 
len ratingthree It would be nice if teams could be separated by folders so as to clean up the interface 
len ratingthree Teams categories would do the trick 
len ratingfive Pretty great 
len ratingfive Don t think I would use outside of my job just because I have cell services 
len ratingthree Mobile interface should work better to use with one thumb 
len ratingtwo Since the update the app won t open 
len ratingtwo Was great until update 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble 
len ratingtwo Can you please let us know if you are seeing a crash immediately after startup 
len ratingtwo It will help if you also try reinstalling the app and let us know if that works around the problem 
len ratingtwo You can always send us
len ratingfive Awesome features 
len ratingfive Very good way to communicate with them team 
len ratingfive Even with a small staff it helps keep us informed on projects
len ratingtwo The chat function doesn t work that well 
len ratingtwo I have to navigate through multiple screens every time I want to get to our group chat
len ratingfive  When I go to check the status of a team member it is frequently not updated until I actually click on their name then it shows the current status 
len ratingfive For example it will show as not active yellow then when I click on them they will turn into a green check 
len ratingfive Teams or Slack 
len ratingfive If you are on Office organization Teams is a no brainer 
len ratingone The chat feature is not usable 
len ratingone Keeps freezing every time I open it
len ratingfive They kind of ruined Skype with Skype for Business but at least they are starting to make up for that 
len ratingone User presence and notifications are broken beyond belief 
len ratingthree Seems like the line during calls fails frequently
len ratingfive Great work team 
len ratingfive I ve been using Teams for a year now and love it 
len ratingfive Nothing else compares 
len ratingfive We produce marketing videos for Microsoft would love to do one on this product 
len ratingfive I realize Teams is derivative bu like many Microsoft offerings when they do bring it out it becomes industry standard 
len ratingfive This app saves me hours a week primarily through keeping my inbox empty and my team moving forward through quick simple and timely input 
len ratingfive Add to that instant meetings archived conversations and all the rest you have a winner 
len ratingfive This software has been invaluable in our efforts to startup our business 
len ratingfive We tie teams with our task management software asana to give us a seamless way to track an idea all the way through to a complete solution 
len ratingfive I ve tried numerous different comparable options and teams was the obvious winner 
len ratingfive Should be able to search for the channel quickly from phone It s not working Should be able to search for the tasks assigned to a particular person
len ratingfive Wonderful app
len ratingfour Search feature is not good 
len ratingfour It does search the wiki 
len ratingone The app was great before the latest update 
len ratingone Now I can t work from the road because the app will not Work on my iPhone or iPad 
len ratingone Annoying 
len ratingfive So great to be able to sort collaborations outside email chains 
len ratingthree Pretty decent application 
len ratingthree I use it to collaborate with my colleagues 
len ratingthree Though the app needs improvement with regards to UI 
len ratingthree The most annoying thing is that I cannot turn off the notifications for email 
len ratingthree Even though I ve already seen my new messages couple of hours after I still receive a notification on my work email 
len ratingthree It s just annoying 
len ratingthree But overall nice app 
len ratingfour Call quality is very clear 
len ratingfour I love that I can join an audio call on my iPhone while also connecting from my PC so I can see the presenter s screen 
len ratingfour Chat features allow rich text messages and you can edit sent messages The one drawback is that you can t send files unless you are using OneDrive for business 
len ratingfour Our organization doesn t have a subscription so I still have to email files 
len ratingtwo Dissapointed with the stability and ease of navigation keeps freezing and content displayed in a less user friendly way than on the PC version 
len ratingfour Love the teams app especially for the chat feature 
len ratingfour The only two drawbacks are quality of video chats and the fact that you don t get notified when chats or posts are made outside of the chat room 
len ratingfour This results in delayed response time unless you constantly monitor your teams 
len ratingfour  This is a very useful app 
len ratingfour It works great for getting people on a team all on one page and sharing files and data 
len ratingfour Notifications are a little lacking on the mobile version 
len ratingfour One on One chat is a little lacking because of the notification issue it is quick and smooth but you don t always get informed when you have a message 
len ratingfour This maybe because I switch between the Desktop iPad and iPhone versions throughout the day but getting a notification on my devices is essential for maintaining communication
len ratingfive This is one the best team collaboration tools I ve used 
len ratingfive I have used the Teamwork platform and love it s tools but this one tips the scale for me with it s tools interface and accessibility 
len ratingthree I just wish that the contacts were in alphabetical order on the app like on the PC
len ratingtwo I have the latest app with latest iOS on iPhone XR Turn incoming video off doesn t work 
len ratingtwo It just keeps drinking up the mobile data 
len ratingone Constantly crashes on iPhone XR 
len ratingone I have to constantly delete and reinstall 
len ratingone At least it is better than the Gawd awful web interface 
len ratingone I really must say that I prefer a competitor app that is about half the file size 
len ratingone This could use some improvement all around 
len ratingfour Good app 
len ratingfour I do like Teams but can t understand why it attempts to go to the App Store before opening in the teams app 
len ratingone  Cannot type in a Teams chat without words disappearing or being chopped up 
len ratingone Something broken with text entry 
len ratingone Zero problems with keyboard text entry on other iOS apps so can only assume the Teams app is intercepting keyboard input in a broken fashion 
len ratingone Teams is effectively unusable on iOS for typing messages 
len ratingfive Thanks Teams 
len ratingfive Now I can work from everywhere access files and keep updated on multiple projects Great 
len ratingthree Unless we go to the left nav and open it up there is no way to quickly know if there were any new messages in any team or chat
len ratingfour The MS Teams App is fantastic 
len ratingfour It s easy to set up and easy to get others to adopt 
len ratingfour The only reason I didn t give it stars is the limitation on licensing for guests only 
len ratingfour That blows 
len ratingfour It really should matter guest invites 
len ratingfour MS can you change this 
len ratingfour PLEASE find a way to allow me to print from the teams environment on AT LEAST PDFs 
len ratingfour You need to add inline message reply to chats like WhatsApp 
len ratingfour I have an ongoing group chat with colleagues and it is very hard to know who replied to what when everyone is chatting
len ratingthree Please incorporate more chat features like blasting announcements etc 
len ratingthree The app itself feels heavy and is slow to load 
len ratingthree Integration between outlook and SharePoint needs to be ironed out as does planner and outlook tasks 
len ratingthree At my firm we use teams as the de facto communications hub but these little loose ends drive us nuts 
len ratingfive My company recently deployed Teams and it has made a huge difference in the way we work 
len ratingfive Teams works like we do so it has been a huge enabler 
len ratingfive I use Chat Meetings Files and Planner a lot 
len ratingone  I won t go into Slack vs this or anything 
len ratingone Even after setting the switches to configure notifications I still won t get updates on convos til I open the app 
len ratingfive It s perfect and easy to use just maybe if just add the option of sharing screen from the smartphone will the perfect tool for the geek road warrior 
len ratingfour So easy to share the docs and design needed for the projects 
len ratingfour It is like all in one tool 
len ratingfour Like the app overall 
len ratingfour There is a lag with push notifications on iOS devices 
len ratingfour Hope this is improved soon 
len ratingthree We need the ability to customize what sound is played for a notification 
len ratingthree Right now we can only turn on and off the sound which ability to choose what sound should be played 
len ratingthree It just uses the default iOS notification sound just like so many other apps 
len ratingthree It would be helpful to be able to distinguish these notifications from other apps 
len ratingfive Continuity across IM and all time 
len ratingfive What more do you want
len ratingfive This is an awesome tool for great collaboration
len ratingfive SB never had conversations in sync between desktop and mobile clients 
len ratingfive This one simple improvement makes Teams much more useful 
len ratingfive In addition having consolidated access to communications and documentation in one app is very beneficial 
len ratingone Why wouldn t you just use Slack 
len ratingone The video and audio quality are terrible Zoom doesn t have the same issues so it s not my computer or network 
len ratingone Teams has ugly visual design crashes constantly mobile and desktop doesn t always alert you to new messages or gives you an alert while you are looking at the message the alert is about 
len ratingone Microsoft makes consistently bad software products and this a great example of that poor trend 
len ratingfour I am a frequent teams user 
len ratingfour I should say it s a big upgrade over Skype and it s not fair to compare it with slack at this point 
len ratingfour Pros o integration can edit word excel etc Calls meetings share filing and recordings Cons Cannot delete conversation history for a particular person which makes it slow The history scroll on a chat takes forever to load making it irritable If I am talking to a person based on referring to another person s previous chat I e copy pasting some stuff from person to person s chat and going backward and forward every time the cursor comes to the latest message and not from where I left off
len ratingtwo Windows vista in form 
len ratingtwo Uninspired 
len ratingfive Teams is great for managing any project and how it integrates with SharePoint to allow access to all team members to all project files 
len ratingfive The meeting function is also great where you can initiate live conf calls screen share etc 
len ratingone I accidentally clicked the onedrive I made instead of the one created by my school and now I cannot log into team won t let me back in 
len ratingfive I really love Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive It has everything a company needs a software team needs a team needs 
len ratingfive Best way to communicate in the office without being disruptive in meetings 
len ratingfive Never miss anyone away from their desk Easy intuitive effective it works 
len ratingfour Always room for improvement but a great app and integrates well across devices
len ratingfive Teams app is awesome 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone Not being able to share SharePoint lists makes this useless 
len ratingone Not sure why they took it away but now we had to change how we hold our meetings when we used this application 
len ratingone What a waste 
len ratingfive For travelers having all information easily accessible in one single place has been extremely useful 
len ratingtwo The worstttt app Thanks for your feedback and sorry to know that you didn t like the App 
len ratingtwo We would love to understand what we can improve to enhance your experience with the App 
len ratingtwo You can always reach out to us at 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive The Tool allow seamless integration in between personal and profesi n life 
len ratingfive Love the features video quality and reliability
len ratingfive I love using the Teams app for jumping into meetings and chatting with coworkers when on the go 
len ratingfive It is great for staying connected when away from my computer 
len ratingfive Very few issues with the app for me 
len ratingfive Seamlessly switch between desktop app and mobile app 
len ratingfive This even let s you attend team meetings online 
len ratingone I logon but all I see is a loading screen that never populates with my teams 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble you are having with the App 
len ratingone Can you please go to Hamburger Menu gt Settings gt Help gt Report an Issue and send us your logs 
len ratingone That will help us identify and fix the issue that the App is running i
len ratingtwo  There needs to be a way to turn off the iOS CallKit integration 
len ratingtwo I don t want to see work calls listed in my personal iPhone recent calls list just because I have this app installed 
len ratingfour Teams is close but not quite as intuitive as Slack 
len ratingfour However corp 
len ratingfour IT shops love it since it s baked into MS subscriptions 
len ratingfour As such and as an almost Slack it s good enough 
len ratingfour And the iPhone app I think is done well 
len ratingfive Nice to get in touch with team members and end to end tracking 
len ratingfive Love having access to my teams while I m on the go
len ratingthree  Honestly for a Microsoft iOS app it works fine 
len ratingthree It s basically a less focused bloated version of Slack 
len ratingthree Slack is a great tool because it s focused simple and weaves integrations into the main value proposition conversations 
len ratingthree In true MS style Teams takes that and then bolts on the functionality of every other app in the ecosystem 
len ratingthree The most obnoxious part is the lack of setting granularity to NOT route Teams calls through my phone 
len ratingthree That s an essential option that s not available currently 
len ratingthree So in summation it s fine 
len ratingthree It s indicative of almost all Microsoft apps in that it takes what should be a focused experience and pumps it full of enterprise subscription bloat 
len ratingthree But it s relatively stable so props for that 
len ratingone I ve had the app for about months now and still will only get notifications rarely 
len ratingone I ve used their troubleshooting guide and still no luck 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and reinstalled and am ready to give up 
len ratingone I get one out of every notifications notification emails 
len ratingone It s ridiculous to think they can t fix this 
len ratingfive I am always looking for an easy to use app 
len ratingfive This is one of the best 
len ratingfour  Need to be able to edit WIKIs 
len ratingthree If you could talk to other people outside of your organization 
len ratingthree Everything else works great 
len ratingtwo I love this app 
len ratingtwo I used Slack for work before but this app is really a lot better 
len ratingtwo The organization of channels chats threads is better synced with the work experience 
len ratingtwo Also the extra applications are great for productivity within Teams 
len ratingtwo The only problem and it is a big one is connectivity and speed 
len ratingtwo The app works awful with a slow and semi slow internet connection and it s interface is really slow when I try to find something in the chat history it takes A LOT of time to pull the old messages 
len ratingtwo When using connectors or tabs is the same thing those extras load SO slow we refrain from using them 
len ratingtwo Although the app has so much power we don t use much of it because of this speed problem 
len ratingtwo I hope it gets solved SOON 
len ratingone Personal chat tab is gone from iPhone after new update again Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingone Can you please report the issue from Hamburger gt Settings gt Report an Issue 
len ratingone This will help us find the logs for you and debug the issue that we are seeing We do disable chats under certain conditions enforced by y
len ratingfive Great job Microsoft
len ratingfour Biggest issue I ve run into you can t remove someone from a chat 
len ratingfour You have to create a whole new chat 
len ratingfive This app is amazing 
len ratingfive I travel often for work and I m not missing any functionality switching between my laptop and my phone 
len ratingfive My team and organizational updates come through and I m still able to be readily engaged on key projects and initiatives 
len ratingfive Could not do my job without it 
len ratingfive So useful 
len ratingfive An Excellent Communication and collaboration platform with persistir conversations and file sharing capabilities 
len ratingfive Best app to keep team in one place and it has improved the productivity a lot 
len ratingfive Alex and his team s calls are perfect 
len ratingfive I encourage if you join and you should believe in Alex 
len ratingfive He and the team are here to help us 
len ratingfive My biggest problem was failure to take their recommendation and react 
len ratingfive Just react 
len ratingfive Make the trades they tell you 
len ratingfive I promise they are all here to help you regardless of your experience or time trading 
len ratingfive Jake D 
len ratingone I cannot just use it since app logs me out randomly 
len ratingone Couldn t attend a meeting due to this issue 
len ratingone Worst Microsoft app
len ratingfive  I am still not a fan of the desktop Windows app as it is hard to multitask but I love the mobile app 
len ratingfive Works well and easy to find things 
len ratingfour When you schedule a meeting it would be nice if you could select from a list of free room in the phone app like you can on the desktop
len ratingthree If you have teams through work and school one looses 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s a nice app 
len ratingfour Done
len ratingfive We love using the Teams app and the related applications for planner sharepoint and one drive 
len ratingfive The one thing I would change about this app is the look of the Wiki in dark mode 
len ratingfive At lest on my phone it is not legible 
len ratingfive ccc
len ratingfour Being able to search by person date date range and with search options line AND OR NOT would be a great improvement 
len ratingfour Try to find a chat otherwise is tough 
len ratingfour We like to use the task list as a shopping list or to do list while out of the office and it is not nice to use outside of the desktop app 
len ratingfour Since we use our office primarily as a pit stop to do admin work while everything else is in the field and mobile this feature would be great to get everyone on board on what has already been done 
len ratingfour Also I haven t quite figured out the purpose of having the internal users list separated from the chat list but I think it has something to do with using the functions like task list or meta tag topic based convos so perhaps that is user interface bias on our side 
len ratingfive Muy chida 
len ratingfour I love the Teams app 
len ratingfour If only I could speed up adoption at my firm 
len ratingfour Great job MS team 
len ratingfive This app helps our institutional memory while giving us ease of use and instant feedback 
len ratingfive Very powerful and seeing new use cases every few weeks
len ratingfive Really like it flexible and easy to use
len ratingfive Time to replace Skype for business with this tool 
len ratingfive I use Teams to join meetings while I am traveling 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive This is a great way to stay in touch with colleagues if you use Microsoft Office 
len ratingfive Super easy to use as an app on you desktop or on the web 
len ratingfive It does everything just like you expect it would 
len ratingfive I haven t had any problems 
len ratingfour  just noticed a little menu at the top of a Teams meeting where you can view the current or series of a meeting 
len ratingfour This was helpful as I was able to add the Join Teams link to a series of meeting instead of just the current event 
len ratingfour  big features still missing desktop sharing without a meeting background blur creating a recurring meeting for every other week and the ability to see more than one week in advance 
len ratingfour  when editing an existing meeting I can t find any way to turn it into a recurring meeting 
len ratingfour I know you can do it when you first create a meeting but if you miss that and save the meeting you can no longer change that 
len ratingfour  I was in a round table meeting where I had started a Teams meeting on my iPad Pro but someone else on their PC was sharing the desktop and audio 
len ratingfour We all had to mute our speakers and mic except for one person because we had one remote but the iPad would not allow me to completely turn off the speaker even though the system setting had it off 
len ratingfour I finally had to connect my AirPod in one ear just so that we didn t have to hear it 
len ratingfour The speaker icon in the Teams meeting would not allow me to silence it 
len ratingfour I use Teams every day and with my new iPad Pro becoming more of my daily tool the iOS version is even more critical 
len ratingfour I love how it quickly syncs with the desktop version 
len ratingfour And it has been great for chats and Team calls 
len ratingfour A couple of things are still needed screen sharing without a Teams call ability to set intervals for recurring meetings and the ability to scroll further ahead to see meetings 
len ratingfive This is a great tool for our business 
len ratingfive Learning more all the time about its applications 
len ratingone  Cannot type in a Teams chat without words disappearing or being chopped up 
len ratingone Something dreadfully broken with literally any text entry 
len ratingone Zero problems with keyboard text entry on other iOS apps so can only assume the Teams app is intercepting keyboard input in a broken fashion 
len ratingfive Super easy to use 
len ratingfive Recommend to anyone needing to communicate documents between a mass of people
len ratingthree Great tool but missing features 
len ratingthree Perhaps these missing features are simply because teams hasn t advanced matured yet 
len ratingthree A couple of things missing a global list of folks without having to search 
len ratingthree This would allow to quickly scan who s available rather than searching for someone first 
len ratingthree The org hierarchy is a great feature for those mid size and smaller companies 
len ratingthree Because of the org hierarchy we now utilize the active directory structure 
len ratingthree The problem is their isn t an org hierarchy entry screen and the only way to access it is from a previously selected person 
len ratingthree Good start but needs to catch up with desktop app 
len ratingthree I can do most things in the app but more productive with desktop app
len ratingfour  We recently started using Microsoft teams 
len ratingfour I love a lot of the functionality but oddly enough the notifications don t work consistently and don t work at all in some cases 
len ratingfour There are no pop ups and the notification sounds do not work at all 
len ratingfour We have Dell laptops running windows and HPs that this doesn t work on either 
len ratingfour Just bought a bunch of enterprise licenses so hope it gets fixed soon
len ratingfive It s very good and useful for case management
len ratingfive It s amazing 
len ratingfive Love the interface and functionality and the mobile app is great 
len ratingfive  Teams is actually good 
len ratingfive I ve been so disappointed in MS products for years that I don t even use Office unless I have to most things I translate to Google docs 
len ratingfive So far simple enough elegant enough and powerful enough to do what I m looking to do 
len ratingfive Dark theme is finally here 
len ratingfive  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfive You asked we listened 
len ratingfive Now you can enable Dark Theme by going to Settings General 
len ratingfive Hope you ll like it 
len ratingone As the owner of a MS team I can t even make a new folder in files to upload files and no one in the team can do their job now no one can upload files to share with the team 
len ratingone Can t make a new folder 
len ratingone Cannot even upload files to existing team folders 
len ratingone You destroyed a questionable app in the first place but now you literally destroyed ALL functionality and any usefulness of what is supposed to be productivity 
len ratingone If I were the head of whatever unit that made this update every single person would have been fired 
len ratingone I m livid right now 
len ratingfive After enduring the legacy systems of MOC Lync Skype for Business etc 
len ratingfive it is great Microsoft just started over and came up with an easy app with a simple UI that with just a few clicks offers conference call video chats and simple screen sharing 
len ratingfive Granted it s modeled after Slack but who cares it works 
len ratingfive Often times I d rather use my phone to join meetings because it s more laggy and unreliable on desktop
len ratingfive This application is just amazing 
len ratingfive From desktop to phone I can schedule meetings take notes share files and chat with colleagues all in one place 
len ratingfive My favorite feature is the ability to take meeting minutes notes right in the meeting window 
len ratingfive No need to email a separate document which I sometimes forget 
len ratingfive While I am still getting used to and learning other functionalities the User Interface is truly welcoming 
len ratingfive Teams has replaced quite a few of my work apps 
len ratingfour Great app for communication but wrecks battery life 
len ratingfour Be ready to charge times per day when running iPhone 
len ratingthree Trying to replace project related emails with this 
len ratingthree I ve really only one complaint about notifications 
len ratingthree Maybe I haven t found the right notification setting but it would be nice to have the option to get a notification if a file is uploaded to a directory on one of my teams 
len ratingthree The way it is if someone uploads a file to one of the teams I m on they have to notify me or I periodically check and eventually notice it 
len ratingthree I like the aesthetics of the app 
len ratingthree If I can find out how to get file notifications similar to what Dropbox has for years it would rate or stars 
len ratingfour I am a student at Hinds Community College and Teams was just activated for my school a few days ago 
len ratingfour I am now trying to create a study group for one of my classes and I am unable to find one of my classmates 
len ratingfour Although I can find this person in delve 
len ratingfour Other than this it s a great app 
len ratingthree Planners do not open in teams just a black screen Need ability to set default tab or home screen 
len ratingthree Need ability to minimize the teams panel 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive This tool enables me to stay out of email interact with my team and get more done 
len ratingfive  MSFTAdvocate
len ratingthree Like it but please add private channels 
len ratingfour Needs the ability to sign into multiple organizations with different domains 
len ratingfour We have two office accounts and we cannot get alerts across the teams 
len ratingfour Needs this functionality to compete with Slack 
len ratingfour  big features still missing desktop sharing without a meeting background blur creating a recurring meeting and the ability to see more than one week in advance 
len ratingfour  when editing an existing meeting I can t find any way to turn it into a recurring meeting 
len ratingfour I know you can do it when you first create a meeting but if you miss that and save the meeting you can no longer change that 
len ratingfour  I was in a round table meeting where I had started a Teams meeting on my iPad Pro but someone else on their PC was sharing the desktop and audio 
len ratingfour We all had to mute our speakers and mic except for one person because we had one remote but the iPad would not allow me to completely turn off the speaker even though the system setting had it off 
len ratingfour I finally had to connect my AirPod in one ear just so that we didn t have to hear it 
len ratingfour The speaker icon in the Teams meeting would not allow me to silence it 
len ratingfour I use Teams every day and with my new iPad Pro becoming more of my daily tool the iOS version is even more critical 
len ratingfour I love how it quickly syncs with the desktop version 
len ratingfour And it has been great for chats and Team calls 
len ratingfour A couple of things are still needed screen sharing without a Teams call ability to set intervals for recurring meetings and the ability to scroll further ahead to see meetings 
len ratingfive I have been using teams for two weeks and it is a very Efficient tool for cross team collaboration 
len ratingfive It s just Fantastic and very easy to use 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingone Get signin error
len ratingfour This app is pretty decent and unique 
len ratingfour I wish it would give you the options to share multiple screens instead of one during the meetings 
len ratingfour I wish the app would also include features where it notifies you that a task has been assigned to you 
len ratingfour We share videos often in this and would be great if we could rewind them rather than have to replay them 
len ratingfive Mobile app is great but the desktop app me the option for persistent notifications 
len ratingfive If they dothat I got no complaints 
len ratingone App freezes and makes my phone crash 
len ratingone I need to hard reboot my phone 
len ratingone Please fix XS max
len ratingfive Use it constantly for work 
len ratingfive Excellent App 
len ratingthree And please remember my zoom preference on files 
len ratingfour The app overall is highly functional 
len ratingfour The UI though could use a redesign and some work to make it a smoother UX 
len ratingfive Only video are viewable
len ratingthree It needs to provide a way for users to manage the sound level to the desired level 
len ratingthree It seems that there is no way for users to increase the sound level within MS Teams 
len ratingthree In addition can it be enhanced to allow team owners to archive or mute the general channel 
len ratingfour My only complaint is when in a Teams meeting whenever another person joins the call it mutes the person speaking for seconds 
len ratingfour Turning off notifications didn t resolve the issue I haven t found a resolution after extensive Googling
len ratingone I don t know what happened but the last update has given the Teams app an unreadably small font size 
len ratingone Please fix so it s usable again 
len ratingfour I m really enjoying Teams but would really like to have a built in calendar in the app it will be perfect 
len ratingfive TEAMS is far superior for remote group communication compared to our other product currently in use Cisco Jabber 
len ratingfive My teams prefer MS Teams for its simple approach to communication and never failing to receive a message which is a problem with Jabber 
len ratingfive Also no syncing issues between devices which is a problem with Jabber 
len ratingfour With tight Office integration Teams has become my go to for inner office communication 
len ratingfour Being able to basically has sub channels as opposed to Slack really helps keep things organized 
len ratingfour My only complaint with the app is that you can miss notifications while simultaneously using the web computer software as well 
len ratingfour If they fix these small syncing issues and add the ability to edit the Wiki via the apps this will be a star app 
len ratingfive A good tool to share any information about team activities 
len ratingfive Efficient and on purpose tool 
len ratingfive Best voice and collaboration tool in the world right now 
len ratingfour I ve been using Teams and while it isn t as robust as Slack it has some nice features that integrates it with other Microsoft products 
len ratingfour The frustrating part is that I ve turned on followed and allowed every setting I can but Teams fails to consistently alert me to messages posted to a team 
len ratingfour I ve responded hours and days late to messages 
len ratingfour Either someone has to me personally or I have to stare at the app and watch the message happen 
len ratingfour Hopefully that s smoothed out 
len ratingthree This is a great app except one flaw 
len ratingthree None of get notifications for anyone posting comments or material on our chat board 
len ratingthree We even updated our notification alarms in the laptop and cellphones and still nothing 
len ratingthree That is a pretty big deal 
len ratingthree If anyone has advice to fix that I m all ears 
len ratingthree Like many of the features esp 
len ratingthree the ability to use it from my phone but it s still feels like a preteen product not yet in puberty 
len ratingthree It is missing basic features and everything is in one window no pop outs at all 
len ratingthree  so awkward to use a lot of flipping between embedded apps chats etc 
len ratingthree and syncing can be an issue 
len ratingthree Once it s a grown up I ll like it better I hope 
len ratingfour Teams is great 
len ratingfour My only request is to add a photo sharing storing app to the Microsoft suite 
len ratingfive Best tool for team collaboration ever 
len ratingfive Blows away Skype 
len ratingfive Easy to collaborate with team members 
len ratingfive Nice work teams 
len ratingone it wanted some extra sign with phone 
len ratingone I deleted it 
len ratingone Stay away 
len ratingfive This is a great tool for multimedia devices 
len ratingfive They can be as basic as complex as he would like it to be with lots of features available but not necessary for some cases 
len ratingfive The cloud based file sharing is definitely a big plus 
len ratingfour Love the new Teams app just waiting for a few Slack like features 
len ratingfour More granular notification options are the most glaring omission 
len ratingfour Need the ability to snooze notifications globally and for single channels 
len ratingthree  Stop making me re log in please Hi Georgey Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree Could you please go to Settings and Send Feedback to us 
len ratingthree This will help us get more information to solve your issue 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Very handy and Great App 
len ratingfive Never failed 
len ratingone Needs Hashtags for conversations and needs it now 
len ratingone Why are we evening having to ask for this right now 
len ratingfive The app itself is pretty good although I mostly only use it s chat feature 
len ratingfive The problem is Microsoft needs a diagram in order to explain where Teams fits in to its suite of solutions 
len ratingfive I feel like Skype is getting killed which I hope is sooner rather than later 
len ratingfive Teams seems to be better but I m still not all that jazzed about it 
len ratingfive It can t be as bad as Skype I hope 
len ratingthree Great upgrade on Skype for Business though
len ratingtwo This app sucked down of my battery usage in the last hours with background activities 
len ratingtwo Seems kind of ridiculous considering the application s functionality 
len ratingfive It s got as much functionality of the desktop app as it could while still being a first class iPhone app 
len ratingfour  All in all this is a pretty good app 
len ratingfour I use the app for auto on most conference calls and just use my computer for the screen sharing 
len ratingfour However I usually get dropped once an hour 
len ratingfour Also the connection is rough on data calls so a phone call option would be nice 
len ratingfour In a work setting I need to reply any comment specifically just to that 
len ratingfour How do I do it 
len ratingfour Just a blind text and send 
len ratingtwo Since the last update this app uses up much more battery power when I make calls via the app 
len ratingtwo It also make my phone warm so I m assuming the OS usage has changed 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingfive It s very helpful when working together with a group 
len ratingfive Channels help keep conversations together 
len ratingfive I like the video and share screen features 
len ratingthree  This is not very useful on an IPad 
len ratingthree I also have a Surface Pro works great on the Surface Pro although I have an business app that is exclusive to my Ipad that allows me to create and store word and PDF docs I would like to be able to upload these docs directly into Teams although this app seems to be a viewer for IPad 
len ratingthree Will you be updating this app to allow it to be used for more than a viewer on an Apple device 
len ratingthree We are a mobile department we need to be able to access store and share docs through the cloud 
len ratingfour But wish notifications worked better 
len ratingfour Much better than Skype
len ratingone Ever since January in the afternoon Neither I nor my technicians can hear the caller when they call using the mobile app 
len ratingone We use a queue we have full cloud pbx with pstn calling 
len ratingone This is not teams with teams calling 
len ratingone There are no problems with meetings within teams 
len ratingone We tried taking the calls with wi fi and then with just our phone plans 
len ratingone Some of us are with tmobile and others under att 
len ratingone Its queue 
len ratingone An outsider calls our queue call comes into teams and after the call connects you can t hear the other person 
len ratingone Sometimes they hear you sometimes they don t 
len ratingone We tried placing the caller on hold and then resuming the call but then the app isn t consistent with accepting the hold 
len ratingone It just wont do anything 
len ratingone And then the call failed screen appears 
len ratingone We really need this fixed 
len ratingfive In a world where young innovative companies having been running circles around time honored giants like Microsoft IBM Oracle and SAP it is rare to see one of the s companies produce an application that is to put it bluntly relevant 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams puts Microsoft back on the must have software map and could become the bridge the connects the old world with the new world 
len ratingfive Unlike past product offerings Microsoft Teams has made it easy to integrate newer non Microsoft apps side by side with trusted enterprise apps like Office and SharePoint 
len ratingfive Imagine a team collaboration home page where topic based chat rooms instant webcam meetings private cloud file storage mobile productivity apps and trusted office documents live side by side in perfect harmony 
len ratingfive For companies who are trying to make the transition from old to new from Gen X to Millenials and Gen Z Microsoft Teams provides an easy and intuitive way to get there 
len ratingfive  Five stars 
len ratingfive MS and has done a great job with this and many other apps 
len ratingtwo Can t turn off email notifications separately of general alert notifications 
len ratingfive MS TEAMS app allows you to view and share screen while you commute to the office which is the best part I ve liked 
len ratingfive Audio and video quality is just excellent including the background blur 
len ratingfive Microsoft Teams makes work life so much easier and smarter 
len ratingtwo It s awesome to have all the features this app provides 
len ratingtwo HOWEVER Notifications don t work unless you have the app running in the background 
len ratingtwo I m missing important conversations 
len ratingtwo All the other apps have push notifications even the cheap free ones 
len ratingfive Works better on phone than on desktop 
len ratingfour I see a lot of people have my request to have a sort feather for the Teams area 
len ratingfour Manually dragging them is a drag 
len ratingfour Love the app and the emojis but you cannot delete old messages 
len ratingfour How do wipe these 
len ratingfour Please advise simply closing the conversation does not work 
len ratingone We have connected other companies with our Skype but it shows to them as user is not using Skype for business message 
len ratingone Also all the chat messages from Skype business does not get into teams 
len ratingone We are expected to run two apps Skype business and teams 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingone If we have upgraded to teams Microsoft should allow seamless integration and don t force us to use two apps 
len ratingone Fix it ASAP 
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingfour Only gripe I received an image in a message from a coworker but could not save it to my camera roll 
len ratingfive But I love it 
len ratingfive It s fast and has good UX 
len ratingfive I wish I could say the same about the OS X app but it has some stability issues for me and my team 
len ratingfive Constant crashing and sluggy 
len ratingthree Teams has poor integration with the iOS MacOS and Safari 
len ratingthree On iOS the chat notification sound is the same as voicemail and the app does not provide a way to change it 
len ratingthree On macOS notifications are not integrated with the system thus hidden when using an app in full screen 
len ratingthree It also uses a lot of processor time when receiving multiple consecutive messages 
len ratingthree The web version does not support Safari 
len ratingthree It requires Chrome or Firefox 
len ratingthree Overall it feels Microsoft does a poor job at anything not Windows 
len ratingfive  MS TEAMS app allows you to view and share screen while you commute to the office which is the best part I ve liked 
len ratingfive Audio and video quality is just excellent including the background blur 
len ratingfive Teams has really streamlined communication for me and my projects 
len ratingfive No more email clutter 
len ratingfive I just wish there was a way to archive or save conversations back to our network to document feedback etc 
len ratingfive User friendly and syncs really well with desktop
len ratingfive I really like teams and this is coming from a slack user 
len ratingfive Some core functionality is missing but looks looks like the improvements are on the road map 
len ratingfive Great audio quality easy to use and so accessible from mobile and desktop 
len ratingfive I love how I can join a call from my mobile and watch the screen share at the same time 
len ratingfive I rarely ever have issues with the mobile app like I do with the desktop app sometimes 
len ratingone Notifications sound is very low plz do something
len ratingfive Best collab app ever 
len ratingthree  Need xs max iPhone support badly 
len ratingfive Highly responsive app and ease to use intuitively 
len ratingfive Great job Microsoft 
len ratingfive Never have issues connecting and video is clean
len ratingthree Love the app missing notifications though 
len ratingfour Most of the time Teams is in background 
len ratingfour It still is in battery consumption 
len ratingfour iPhone S 
len ratingfour New battery 
len ratingfour The UI on channels in particular needs work 
len ratingfour Each message shouldn t be that large 
len ratingfour Don t need to show reply each time 
len ratingfour I d also like the nav bar to include access to both chats and channels together which Slack does 
len ratingtwo Nothing about this feels like a native iPad application 
len ratingtwo There are no keyboard shortcuts so good luck using it to do any real business for any length of time 
len ratingtwo At certain split view widths the application is unusably narrow and at other widths it s comically wide 
len ratingtwo This application simply needed more polish and development time 
len ratingtwo Since some consultant convinced our company to migrate to this crappy application I sure hope it gets the care it so desperately needs 
len ratingfour This is a great app to use for all communications in the office 
len ratingfour Our owner is out of state so it allows him to be more connected to what s happening in our office 
len ratingfour We use the instant messaging a lot to get quick answers that doesn t require a phone call that interrupts work completely 
len ratingfour Love the video chat feature and the capability to take control of one another s computers 
len ratingfour Really helps when viewing reports or working on projects together when not in the same office 
len ratingfour Been using the product for over a month now and so far it has met all of our needs 
len ratingthree Plain and simple 
len ratingthree Teams needs private channels 
len ratingfour Love the Teams app however with the newest version on iOS you moved the organization link from the menu to the bottom 
len ratingfour Now when i click on it the app crashes every time 
len ratingfour I am on iOS on iPhone XS Max 
len ratingone Almost twice as big as the slack download and half as useful 
len ratingone  Hi Thank you for sharing your feedback one of our resolutions for is to trim down our size while providing even more useful functionality 
len ratingone If you can provide more specific information on how we can improve on we will defin
len ratingfive Team up and stop slacking off Thank you for the review 
len ratingone There s a bug when typing using the keyboard 
len ratingone The curser keeps jumping back and forth 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfour Almost gave it stars which I rarely do 
len ratingfour The app has gotten very powerful and the UI continues to improve 
len ratingfour Great job by Microsoft 
len ratingfour  Thanks Mike 
len ratingfour Appreciate the kind words and the stars 
len ratingfour Let us know what we can do to get the th star 
len ratingfour  D Cheers 
len ratingfive Needs a better notification process and options for mobile 
len ratingfive Need a global invite for specific selected people 
len ratingfive Need usage reports 
len ratingfive Who is using etc 
len ratingfive So far teams has become a great platform for my team to work on projects host daily meetings where my team comes prepared due to the group accountability that Teams provides and as a general chat functionality 
len ratingfive I like the app and i love the ability to move all of the software I use that is secure and approved with our infosec team 
len ratingfive Some interface improvements could be that when you work on a Team PowerPoint the slides can be small due to margin layout 
len ratingfive There is a little bit of lag on what other team members are doing in a document so you need to have a few seconds sometimes a minute of patience if collaborating on a document 
len ratingfive Overall very impressed and I recommend this 
len ratingfive Nick Berardi Associate Mgr Logistics at Tesla Inc 
len ratingfive  But not for people who used old way of working 
len ratingfour  All the IM pieces have moved
len ratingthree Would like to click on people and see participants 
len ratingthree This is super hard now 
len ratingthree Meeting starts with mic on in default 
len ratingthree Should be mute by default 
len ratingthree I ll send more later 
len ratingfive Love the app
len ratingfour The only thing missing is the conference call that s Generated for Skype meetings
len ratingfive I would like to have a calendar view similar to what is available in SharePoint 
len ratingone So overly complicated and utterly useless
len ratingfour  Allow some customization of sound notifications 
len ratingfour The audible alert is barely noticeable 
len ratingtwo Don t understand why a user is unable to delete a message received 
len ratingtwo Crazy
len ratingone  This is an excellent product on a PC but falls short on iOS iPad iPhone 
len ratingone When accessing shared files in Teams program it takes you to a website to log in 
len ratingone When our management has a meeting with iPads we use OneDrive to access files on Microsoft Teams to work around the fact you can t open the files inside this app 
len ratingfive Way better than slack 
len ratingfive The tabs are the way to go 
len ratingfive Good job ms
len ratingone It s to slow messages disappear and makes my job harder to do 
len ratingfive Finally an app design that got it right 
len ratingfive Call controls are great 
len ratingfive It has QoS of video conferencing that lets you know when you should shut down things to ensure the voice quality remains 
len ratingfive Overall very pleased with this app
len ratingfour Works great everywhere but my iPhone 
len ratingfour I never get any notification 
len ratingfive This app is a life saver 
len ratingfive Exactly what I have been looking for 
len ratingfive It simplifies teamwork and team collaboration all in one spot 
len ratingfive Best part we are out on the field a lot this application is accessible via mobile devices 
len ratingfour Only reason it s is because I can access the planner app through a tab on my desktop but get authentication errors when using the app 
len ratingfour  I m a guest of someone else s team 
len ratingfour Would like to be able to see when people saw my messages and who
len ratingfour Works great only one thing I miss 
len ratingfour I may not be aware of the capability 
len ratingfour But there are times when I wasn t to search the conversation for a phrase or keyword 
len ratingfour At present there does not appear to be a way to do this 
len ratingfour I did regularly in Skype for Business 
len ratingfour It works well enough just wish the UI was friendlier 
len ratingfour It s kind of awkward 
len ratingfour  I join meetings from my wrist while driving 
len ratingfour Don t want to fiddle with my iPhone when driving 
len ratingfive I m glad Microsoft is making it easy for teams to communicate and integrate information 
len ratingfive Teams has been a life saver for my company 
len ratingfive Excellent application to collaborate in a small business
len ratingfive I love this product 
len ratingfive Takes some getting used to but start out with a Team Chat and then grow from there 
len ratingfive Any other way can feel overwhelming 
len ratingthree We recently switched to Teams from another collaboration tool we have been using for years 
len ratingthree The Teams app is stable and works great but there are still missing functionality that we need 
len ratingthree POTS dial in for meetings and the capability of making the platform call you back to join a meeting 
len ratingthree Meetings cannot be scheduled for starting times in minutes increments 
len ratingthree It only accepts meetings that start at the top or bottom of the hour 
len ratingfour Perfect synching across devices 
len ratingfour Seriously what more could you want 
len ratingfour The app could use better Skype interoperability but very pleased so far 
len ratingfive Our company deployed this app to all desktop PC and mobile devices about three weeks ago and it s been a huge communication asset for our company 
len ratingfive It s helped bridge a communication gap between field and office staff 
len ratingfive Can add picture videos emojis and easily create channels 
len ratingfive It like if Skype facebooks and text messaging had a baby it would Microsoft Teams 
len ratingfive  Great voice quality for meetings and calls connects seamlessly with my car Bluetooth and other Bluetooth devices 
len ratingfive Love the message forward feature which doesn t exist in desktop app 
len ratingfive This is a really good application 
len ratingfive It has all capabilities as the desktop computer version does 
len ratingfive Don t believe me try it for yourself 
len ratingfive You ll be happy you did 
len ratingfour I m using this App looking for an Messaging and document transfer service that I can use across iOS and Android 
len ratingfour This works pretty well as long as you transfer documents that are in the Microsoft format 
len ratingfour As an example you can transfer a Excel spreadsheet but not one in iOS Numbers 
len ratingfive Everything in one place contacts meetings share point one note 
len ratingfive You can even have separate channels to keep your projects organized 
len ratingfive Same experience on all devices mobile or desktop windows or apple 
len ratingfive Coool 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingthree Ko Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree You asked we listened 
len ratingthree Now you can enable Dark Theme by going to Settings General 
len ratingthree Hope you ll like it 
len ratingthree It s been months 
len ratingthree Please update for xs max screen size 
len ratingthree All other Microsoft apps have 
len ratingfive Really light and responsive nicely integrated with my workplace 
len ratingfive I can go from the phone to the computer seamlessly
len ratingone I organized daily meeting with MSFT and Quanta as our supplier 
len ratingone We kept having issues with Team for months The team members of Quanta don t have microsoft com account 
len ratingone They cannot share their screen reliably 
len ratingone Team needs to take care of this issue seriously because MSFT needs to interact not only with people have MSFT account but people without the account 
len ratingone If the fallback plan is to ask all the team members of my supplier to get Microsoft account please let us know how to enable them to get such account 
len ratingone If the fallback plan is to use Skype then please maintain stability on Skype 
len ratingone My team members are experiencing all kinds of issues on Skype audio share screen not able to use Skype as they already migrated 
len ratingone Thanks Kathy Yang
len ratingfive Love how all our communication is available to all for awareness and free to comment and provide guidance if needed already reduced emails dramatically and were just in learning stage 
len ratingfive Love the Teams App 
len ratingfive Intuitve n easy
len ratingfive Great business productivity app 
len ratingfive Very intuitive and easy to use
len ratingfive SO much better performance than Skype for Business 
len ratingfive No dropped calls
len ratingfive We made the move to Teams in winter and it has significantly reduced email volume and our team s ability to capture thought leadership on multiple levels 
len ratingfive We use it for our book club collaborating with other teams across our company proposal development and the app ensures I can stand up from my desk every once in a while and still be part of the conversation 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft 
len ratingfive Our team uses it for all formal communications we now use emails very less frequently 
len ratingfive Combines video calling texting and emailing 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive One thing that needs changing is ability to retract messages
len ratingtwo Not recommended
len ratingfive It has made our communication better at work which has been a blessing
len ratingfive I finally understood the challenge of trying to get special permission from IT to get Slack installed for my team and then realized that MSTEAMS is included as a part of our Office package 
len ratingfive It seamlessly connects to our outlook directory and different sub teams can be easily created by creating new DLs in outlook 
len ratingfive View Edit share native office files in the app itself setup impromptu meetings with video Share screens great platform overall 
len ratingfive Especially if your IT has already invested in Microsoft products 
len ratingfive I like Chat online to communicate very easy and friendly with hearing and deaf people 
len ratingfive I am using to communicate with hearing coworkers so much easy 
len ratingone I am a teacher 
len ratingone I love the desktop version of Teams as an assignment turn in tool in my classroom 
len ratingone I downloaded this app for my phone so I could keep track of which of my students had turned in their work and also review those assignments on the go 
len ratingone Unfortunately there is no functionality to review assignments on smaller devices 
len ratingone From what I understand it will work on a tablet but not a phone 
len ratingone So I can post assignments to my classes but not actually see my students submissions when they turn them in 
len ratingone The most I can see is a total number for those that have turned it in but it won t let me check who turned in whether their work was properly attached or if their work was of quality 
len ratingone Essentially this app is useless for me until assignment review is added to small devices 
len ratingthree Improve audio quality
len ratingfour Doc 
len ratingfour  picture can be forward between groups on PC
len ratingone I was using HipChat and changed to teams but comparatively it s very slow and doesn t load trams or chats for long time 
len ratingone Very frustrating
len ratingfive I love teams 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and keeps me aware of what my team is doing 
len ratingfive It s great to keep email for customers and teams for internal communication
len ratingone Seems that Microsoft can never get things right and continue to have the same login issues on iOS devices since May of as reported by others 
len ratingone Of course MS support treats you like an idiot and assume you don t know what you re doing when in fact their software is full of bugs 
len ratingone Would not recommend using their mobile app for iOS until they actually get it to work 
len ratingthree There is quite a lag in loading documents sometimes 
len ratingthree Also the edit in teams app for collaboration has seemed to have stopped working 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s an amazing tool for collaboration 
len ratingthree If used to it s fullest it could replace the cost of WebEx for a company and in some solely inter company users email 
len ratingthree I get the full vision but there are some kinks 
len ratingfive My only wish is that there was a way to customize the away messages
len ratingfive  like magic because we discover our connections were there already just by having our office accounts 
len ratingfive This is a great app able to communicate with my employees like txting but not using up there minutes
len ratingtwo When you schedule a meeting it will do all fine but it doesn t have to option to setup reminders of that meeting 
len ratingone We made the switch from Slack to Teams the experience with Push Notifications or more accurately lack of reliable ones has made the experience terrible for the entire team 
len ratingfour The only feature I miss is the giphy the gif selection is rather limited and lame but other than that it s a sold work messaging app 
len ratingfour I like that I can see my meetings for the day with Outlook integration 
len ratingthree I have been using slack for a long time 
len ratingthree I switched to teams because my whole office at work switched to Microsoft Office and we wanted to be uniform across our staff 
len ratingthree Slack seems more sleek in its interface and a bit easier to navigate and use 
len ratingthree The one thing I ve found since I ve been using teams is that there doesn t seem to be a way to comment on a image or file with a sub thread 
len ratingthree Come to think of it I don t think sub threads are a thing at all in Teams 
len ratingthree I really liked that in Slack because the overall conversation can sometimes follow tangents but sub threads help group things together 
len ratingtwo  Love the app and concept but needs work 
len ratingtwo How do I initiate multiple calls and navigate a touch tone menu on the nd call 
len ratingtwo Cannot organize the new contact groups 
len ratingtwo Want to add sort create groups and contacts 
len ratingtwo Needs a dark mode
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  I love the file storage easy sharing options 
len ratingfive This makes communicating efficiently a fun thing to do 
len ratingfive We hold our weekly team meetings on Teams and it s been a great experience but would like an option to have more than active heads 
len ratingfive Another option missing is the ability to see who has viewed my post 
len ratingfive I get this option on my free Crew app 
len ratingfive Seems like a toggle option would be fairly straight forward Keep up the great work
len ratingfour Almost Slack
len ratingfour  when editing an existing meeting I can t find any way to turn it into a recurring meeting 
len ratingfour I know you can do it when you first create a meeting but if you miss that and save the meeting you can no longer change that 
len ratingfour  I was in a round table meeting where I had started a Teams meeting on my iPad Pro but someone else on their PC was sharing the desktop and audio 
len ratingfour We all had to mute our speakers and mic except for one person because we had one remote but the iPad would not allow me to completely turn off the speaker even though the system setting had it off 
len ratingfour I finally had to connect my AirPod in one ear just so that we didn t have to hear it 
len ratingfour The speaker icon in the Teams meeting would not allow me to silence it 
len ratingfour I use Teams every day and with my new iPad Pro becoming more of my daily tool the iOS version is even more critical 
len ratingfour I love how it quickly syncs with the desktop version 
len ratingfour And it has been great for chats and Team calls 
len ratingfour A couple of things are still needed screen sharing without a Teams call ability to set intervals for recurring meetings and the ability to scroll further ahead to see meetings 
len ratingfive What can I say it does what you expect 
len ratingfive Have not encountered any bugs yet 
len ratingfour Overall Teams works well 
len ratingfour What takes time is getting the application on Apple products 
len ratingfour Does not always load easily 
len ratingone  This is almost a great app except for some major flaws 
len ratingone I try to use Teams with different companies and guest access is a nightmare 
len ratingone I work with dozens of customers 
len ratingone I now have to login to each site to check messages 
len ratingone I keep missing important stuff 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone I do like the s and Giphy and my company overpaid Microsoft but still I need better guest access 
len ratingthree I don t like that you can t delete messages 
len ratingthree If there is one feature that seems to drop your rating it s this one 
len ratingthree  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree Message deletion has been a supported feature in the App for some time now 
len ratingthree We will be able to better debug the problem you are seeing if you can please share logs with us from Hamburger gt Settings gt Report an Issue 
len ratingfive Super powerful 
len ratingfive Could take some time for people to get the hang of it and many will fail to realize it s potential 
len ratingthree Assignment section in teams is not working 
len ratingfive The guys and I like to use this application for team chats 
len ratingfive It makes communication seem much faster and gets everyone involved 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfour Otherwise app is great 
len ratingfour  I was in a round table meeting where I had started a Teams meeting on my iPad Pro but someone else on their PC was sharing the desktop and audio 
len ratingfour We all had to mute our speakers and mic except for one person because we had one remote but the iPad would not allow me to completely turn off the speaker even though the system setting had it off 
len ratingfour I finally had to connect my AirPod in one ear just so that we didn t have to hear it 
len ratingfour The speaker icon in the Teams meeting would not allow me to silence it 
len ratingfour I use Teams every day and with my new iPad Pro becoming more of my daily tool the iOS version is even more critical 
len ratingfour I love how it quickly syncs with the desktop version 
len ratingfour And it has been great for chats and Team calls 
len ratingfour A couple of things are still needed screen sharing without a Teams call ability to set intervals for recurring meetings and the ability to scroll further ahead to see meetings 
len ratingthree As a developer we still have to use Slack because it allows you to post a code snippet and colors it like Visual Studio 
len ratingthree That s supper helpful for developer teams 
len ratingthree Notifications on mobile devices are very inconsistent 
len ratingthree Which makes Teams an unreliable communication tool 
len ratingthree Otherwise we love it 
len ratingthree High consumption of battery life
len ratingfive The app integrated with the excel and word apps without any hiccups or delay 
len ratingfive Our team is seamlessly connected at anytime making us more nimble and capable of making decisions at a moments notice 
len ratingfive It s slack from Microsoft 
len ratingfive If you re reading this review your company spent a bunch of money on it 
len ratingfive Don t worry teams is cool too 
len ratingfive A 
len ratingfour The app has come a long way since it s it was introduced 
len ratingfour Still needs integration with Skype and Video Voice and screen sharing 
len ratingfour Hope they can pull in those features without making this an unstable mess like Skype is 
len ratingfive Love this meeting updates filed integration all in one place 
len ratingfive It s the modern day version of AOL Instant messenger for work 
len ratingfive What s not to love 
len ratingfive Works just a good on the iPhone as it does on the desktop 
len ratingfive Best thing since sliced bread
len ratingone Having come from other industry leading apps and being urged to use this product it is amazing to me to see just how far behind this product is 
len ratingone Slow 
len ratingone Cumbersome 
len ratingone It will likely become something worthwhile in the future 
len ratingone MS has the devs to integrate features common elsewhere 
len ratingone But that s not today for sure 
len ratingfive I find the iOS version easier to use than the desktop in some situations but overall the experience is solid 
len ratingone Unlike the Teams app for PCs this app is brain dead 
len ratingone You can t hide chats 
len ratingone If all the places you want to hide irrelevant material it s on you mobile phone 
len ratingone The General page is also a waste of space and there is no way to customize it for your users so it goes directly to files or chats 
len ratingone At this point it is easier to use text and email for both messages and content 
len ratingone The only useful thing it has that the PC app and web interface doesn t is the ability to show if a user has access to Teams or not but since chat is hobbled already it s meaningless 
len ratingone The only thing I find helpful is the calendar because I don t sync my work calendar with my phone because of the way it integrates with my personal calendar and this keeps it separate 
len ratingone Microsoft really needs to work on these apps before rolling them out 
len ratingone And functionality should match the PC app 
len ratingone You may have to do it differently but the functionality should be the same 
len ratingfive  Microsoft Teams puts everything for teams in one great place 
len ratingfive There are a few features that would be helpful if added but overall great for the corporate environment 
len ratingfive Awesome all around just needs a dark mode preferably an OLED dark mode for X and up 
len ratingfive  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfive You asked we listened 
len ratingfive Now you can enable Dark Theme by going to Settings General 
len ratingfive Hope you ll like it 
len ratingthree We have used this company wide now but smartphone notifications are so silent 
len ratingthree It would be nice to customize or at least change to something a little more than a one second sound 
len ratingthree Something with a sound that is more than just a tiny little beep 
len ratingfour Would ve been better to have an option to dial a call out number for meetings 
len ratingfour When the app was working it was great but I have reinstalled the app several times and it keeps crashing 
len ratingfour Checked with a co worker that has an iPhone X and he is experiencing the same thing 
len ratingfour The latest update for Teams resolved the crashing issue 
len ratingfour It has been working well since 
len ratingfour Keep adding features it is a great tool 
len ratingfour Please add the capability to participate in a meeting without being signed in 
len ratingfour The inability to participate without sign in causes issues when a large invite is sent to people that do not have accounts 
len ratingfour Most browsers are supported but the experience is inconsistent 
len ratingfour A consistent experience could be created if the application didn t require a sign in 
len ratingfour  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the bad experience that you had with the App 
len ratingfour Can you please let us know if you are running iOS beta builds on your iPhone X 
len ratingfour Thanks for feedback once again 
len ratingfive Great and Convenient For My Job
len ratingtwo App consistently crashes while typing message
len ratingfive The mobile experience for Teams is fantastic 
len ratingfive So easy to join calls chat look at content etc 
len ratingfive Joining calls and chatting via Skype for Business was always tricky at best but with Teams is it incredibly simple 
len ratingfive Notifications are great too so when traveling it is easy to keep up 
len ratingfour It is 
len ratingfive This app has made my workplace communication better 
len ratingfive We are able to utilize all of the office apps in teams and share documents all in one area 
len ratingfive It s super secure and I like having meetings in Teams 
len ratingfive It s like Skype but we re able to edit documents in real time in Word as were in a meeting 
len ratingfive Teams really does help you achieve more and empowers you collaborate easily 
len ratingfour Need to be able to tie other notifications sounds 
len ratingfour Default is way to wimpy 
len ratingfive  We have been using teams for the last couple of weeks to with collaboration 
len ratingfive So far it s been great but I would recommend watching a few trains webinars or videos before starting 
len ratingfive Pointers on how to structure your teams was greatly beneficial to getting started 
len ratingfive The user interface and structure have a slight learning curve but nothing difficult at all 
len ratingfive Microsoft seems to be moving in the right direction with their business apps so keep it up 
len ratingfive This is the best collaboration tool that allows your team to collaborate maintain documents and files in the same place and increase communications 
len ratingfive I run a technology firm 
len ratingfive We used to use slack 
len ratingfive Teams so far has been great and our team loves it 
len ratingfour  I use Teams every day and with my new iPad Pro becoming more of my daily tool the iOS version is even more critical 
len ratingfour I love how it quickly syncs with the desktop version 
len ratingfour And it has been great for chats and Team calls 
len ratingfour A couple of things are still needed screen sharing without a Teams call ability to set intervals for recurring meetings and the ability to scroll further ahead to see meetings 
len ratingfour Multiple companies 
len ratingfour Multiple logins 
len ratingfour Needs to support that 
len ratingfour Hard to make it integral if you can t leave it open for the company 
len ratingfour  I use Teams every day and with my new iPad Pro becoming more of my daily tool the iOS version is even more critical 
len ratingfour I love how it quickly syncs with the desktop version 
len ratingfour The only thing that I can see asking for is iPad screen sharing outside of a Teams call which just went live today on my MacBook Pro 
len ratingfive Teams is awesome one thing I wish it had was a reply to specific messages function on chats 
len ratingfive This is really a great and helpful tool in my workplace it s changed the flow and ease of all our work
len ratingthree I don t get notifications to appear like other apps when I get a new chat message in MS Teams 
len ratingfive The app is very easy to use and keeps our teams up to date and communicating where everyone can join 
len ratingone  Screen sharing also breaks 
len ratingone On iPad 
len ratingone Share and sharing randomly stops 
len ratingone Switch to Edge and get error about stopped due to null 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble caused 
len ratingone Can you please take the latest update and let us know if you still see this issue 
len ratingone It will help if you can share debug logs from App when you see this issue using Hamburger Menu gt Setti
len ratingfive I luv teams 
len ratingfive I feel it would make us all closer if other CPS s would use it 
len ratingfour I love using Teams app on my IPhone just wish the chat translate feature was there like the Windows pc client 
len ratingtwo Email Notifications don t work on the desktop app 
len ratingtwo And push notifications don t work on the mobile app 
len ratingthree Can t post any pictures or messages doesn t sync at all 
len ratingthree  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble caused 
len ratingthree Can you please take the latest update and let us know if you still see this issue 
len ratingthree It will help if you can share debug logs from App when you see this issue using Hamburger Menu gt Setti
len ratingfive One of our core values at Team Focus Insurance Group is collaboration 
len ratingfive We are preparing to move our company to Teams and I can hardly wait 
len ratingfive It will improve collaboration on projects exponentially 
len ratingfive Thank you Microsoft 
len ratingfour Really find the questions and feedback to be worthwhile 
len ratingfour I do have a few questions on the ins outs of the conversations but hope to get resolved soon 
len ratingthree Needs more security features be it a PIN Touch ID really anything when opening the app 
len ratingthree Please add a dark mode option 
len ratingthree  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree You asked we listened 
len ratingthree Now you can enable Dark Theme by going to Settings General 
len ratingthree Hope you ll like it 
len ratingfive Excellent team app 
len ratingfour The team communication is great so far except for the Wiki 
len ratingfour Really trying to use it but it is severely lacking in functionality and search 
len ratingthree I need the App to inform me about new unread messages 
len ratingone  Recent versions stop working 
len ratingone Messages stuck in Sending and calls say failed 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble caused 
len ratingone Can you please take the latest update and let us know if you still see this issue 
len ratingone It will help if you can share debug logs from App when you see this issue using Hamburger Menu Settings
len ratingfive Solid application
len ratingfive All in one app 
len ratingfive Easiest way to join a meeting ever 
len ratingthree  Please add a dark mode option 
len ratingthree As I understand how app helps tours organizing I ll increase my rating 
len ratingtwo This app would have received stars but NO CUSTOMIZATION OF NOTIFICATION SOUNDS is a HUGE problem 
len ratingtwo As we approach it s time for Microsoft to step it up 
len ratingtwo I need a custom notifier not the same quiet ding as my colleagues 
len ratingtwo Very annoying 
len ratingtwo Is that my device 
len ratingtwo Is that yours 
len ratingtwo Who knows 
len ratingtwo Come on 
len ratingfour It is not in sync with desktop client 
len ratingfour A background sync frequency would be a nice addition 
len ratingfour Else it works as intended 
len ratingfour Great for business collaboration 
len ratingthree Love teams and appreciate a mobile app but need to add the ability to edit the Wiki documents to the iOS devices 
len ratingfour This has been a great function to work through various aspects of our team 
len ratingfour Just a few things would make this app even better when someone post in a channel not just in chat for a notice to show up adding a calendar function would take this app to the next level 
len ratingfour Where each team could have a visible calendar and could have the possibility to either have the same calendar shared amongst the teams or to pick which teams could see the same calendar 
len ratingfour Plus an option to create completely different calendars if needed for various teams 
len ratingfour Otherwise this is a great app 
len ratingthree Notification sound is awful 
len ratingthree Can barely hear it 
len ratingthree Need to change to proper loud sound 
len ratingfive Good one for work 
len ratingfour We have been using this with our team for a couple of months now 
len ratingfour The presence information and ease of messaging to individuals or two teams is great 
len ratingfour We look forward to doing more on the Meeting side soon 
len ratingfour The only disappointment so far is that the mobile app does not recognize phone numbers that are sent in and IM thread 
len ratingfour This is a really handy interface for Teams mobile users and the connectivity with calling on mobile is clutch 
len ratingfour However there are issues with not defaulting to Bluetooth audio output and removing mobile notifications when the desktop client has cleared them common in Outlook iOS 
len ratingfour Mainly in chat or tagged posts 
len ratingfive Our project team uses Teams for collaboration so having a mobile app is a necessity to keep in touch with on the road 
len ratingfive The Teams App on iOS works really well to keep in touch 
len ratingthree It s a great app for now but I hope Microsoft iterates quickly with new and improved capabilities expressed on UserVoice 
len ratingthree Friendly aliases mentions are something my entire team wants ASAP 
len ratingthree Also the threading can be cumbersome to navigate it s too easy to lose track of discussions 
len ratingthree Not sure what would improve that other than make it more like Slack in that regard 
len ratingthree The pros outweigh the cons though 
len ratingfour Calls generally work well 
len ratingfour Needs ability to pin contacts favorites to the top 
len ratingfour I have to restart the app sometimes to get audio and app to work 
len ratingone MY IPAD IS IOS AND I CANT DOWNLOAD IT PLEASE DO STH 
len ratingfour  Too many hoops to jump through to allow notifications through each group 
len ratingfour Also I would LOVE a Dark Theme option mostly cause I have everything with the white background 
len ratingfour  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfour You asked we listened 
len ratingfour Now you can enable Dark Theme by going to Settings General 
len ratingfour Hope you ll like it 
len ratingfive Great tool for excelling at work 
len ratingfive Manage multiple tasks while working together 
len ratingfive Add photos or files for getting projects done and training other team members skills that are necessary 
len ratingfour need formatting code and to know who is on a channel
len ratingthree I can t hear the other person or sometime he can t hear me when we make a call via Teams app
len ratingfour When you receive a chart you get a very visual red circle when you are in other applications so you can see you need to see what chat you got 
len ratingfour In the teams menu it s hard to see it shoes bold the group but when you have many groups is hard to identify 
len ratingthree Need to be able to work with third party vendors not just internal staff 
len ratingfive We started using team to decrease the number of internal emails 
len ratingfive Along the way we learn it is becoming very practical to follow up on projects 
len ratingthree We are using Teams for a chat within our organization 
len ratingthree We have been frustrated that there is no ability to change the volume or type of notification tone on iOS devices 
len ratingthree Sometimes on a check comes through there is no sound or notification at all 
len ratingthree When there is a sound it s barely audible 
len ratingthree Would be great to increase the volume of the notification 
len ratingthree This is a known issue and is discussed on Microsoft forums without a fix yet 
len ratingthree It would be great if it uses the same volume as standard iMessage notification 
len ratingthree To the other reviewer who is having trouble getting the badge to go away there is a Setting for temporary verses persisted notifications which might help 
len ratingfive We just started using Teams 
len ratingfive And I love this app 
len ratingfive So easy to use and fun with the ability to add emojis and GIF
len ratingfive Very useful app but not quite as refined as Slack yet 
len ratingfive I m sure it s a winner for security though as that s Microsoft s bread and butter 
len ratingfour Wish I could customize my status or include a message with a status like Away so I can say I m at lunch or when I ll be back 
len ratingfour I often accidently leave my phone on the charger when I m rushing to a meeting 
len ratingfour This would be a great app if I could make phone calls also send and receive messages through the Apple watch 
len ratingone Use teams for work on Mac OS and Android OS does not load past the purple splash screen on iPhone XS 
len ratingfive Love my team site
len ratingfour But I drop a lot
len ratingfive Easy to use and access from any device 
len ratingfive It s effective and reliable 
len ratingfive Primary tool for our support sales and operations team 
len ratingfive Please open in edge if edge is installed 
len ratingfive Outlook opens link in edge 
len ratingthree Ability to move chat threads onto a different channel or export import to a new Team 
len ratingthree Advanced searching 
len ratingthree Ability to set user permissions at channel level 
len ratingfour Please add dark mode similar to on the computer version 
len ratingfour Thanks Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfour You asked we listened 
len ratingfour Now you can enable Dark Theme by going to Settings General 
len ratingfour Hope you ll like it 
len ratingtwo My company is testing out the free version but a pretty significant change seems to have occurred The sign in page on mobile removed Microsoft account from its wording and tells us that the email address tested it even with the admin account seems to be a personal account 
len ratingtwo The odd thing It worked on one of our phones before installed the app a few days prior on that one but the app and sign in page updated yesterday 
len ratingtwo  other phones had this issue from the beginning but we downloaded the app just yesterday on those 
len ratingtwo The latter makes me think it must be update related 
len ratingtwo Please assist before my company moves on Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the trouble 
len ratingtwo We have found a couple of service side bugs that are effecting this functionality but this remains a supported scenario and we are working on resolving this issue 
len ratingtwo This should be fixed soon 
len ratingone Things just randomly change in this app have a feature on day and next it is gone 
len ratingthree Lot of functions expected from a group chat functionality is missing 
len ratingthree Example we can t add more than people in a group chat 
len ratingthree Also Team channel notifications are not effective 
len ratingthree When you are part of multiple teams if someone sends a message in a channel no effective notification mechanism 
len ratingthree Most of the times you end up missing the new message 
len ratingthree I love almost everything about the app but when you share high resolution monitors the application can t keep up with similar products 
len ratingthree The image is always pixelated 
len ratingone Please fit the scrolling lag on iOS also please fix the refreshing lag on iOS
len ratingthree I am a new user but seems very effective 
len ratingthree I am frustrated however the functionality to add guests is not working 
len ratingthree I have spent time with your support team but nothing yet 
len ratingthree I see people complaining about the same issue in online posts so I know it is not the operator here 
len ratingthree Please fix asap 
len ratingfive  I love using the Teams app 
len ratingfive It works great on the IPhone 
len ratingtwo Its great to have an mobile app version especially for posting and replying to conversations but some major features are not available or accessible in the mobile version 
len ratingtwo Here are some major limitations 
len ratingtwo Files not able to upload files 
len ratingtwo Conversations not able to delete a conversation post that was created by someone who just has member student status 
len ratingtwo Turning on notifications is not intuitive or automatic 
len ratingtwo Turning on notifications has to be done for each individual channel 
len ratingfour Looks great team chat tools 
len ratingfour So far I m loving it and give more feedback once I use this for sometime 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone  For the most recent updates personal chats were removed 
len ratingone You can still access it through workarounds but the tab to get there quickly is not in this new interface 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingone Can you please report the issue from Hamburger Settings Report an Issue 
len ratingone This will help us find the logs for you and debug the issue that we are seeing We do disable chats under certain conditions enforced by your IT admin
len ratingtwo We use this for work and it s convenient but they need to spend some time optimizing the iOS app 
len ratingtwo If you compare this to the Android version it is lacking 
len ratingtwo The biggest thing it needs is the ability to change notification sounds 
len ratingtwo Currently it only allows you to either turn notification sounds on or off but does not allow you to change the sound itself 
len ratingtwo On Android you can choose a different sound for every type of notification you may encounter in Teams 
len ratingtwo I understand that may not be possible to give that many options on iOS but at least allow us to change the notification sound so they are more noticeable 
len ratingfour Love teams unfortunately have a new iPhone XS doesn t seem to work with this app 
len ratingfour I can t get past the purple welcome screen Hi Thank you for reaching out to us and sorry to hear that you are having trouble while using Teams app on your new iPhone XS 
len ratingfour Can you please provide more details about the issue by sending us a screenshot 
len ratingfour Please reach out to us at 
len ratingfive Surprised 
len ratingfive  Not as good as Slack 
len ratingfive But this is actually a pretty good app from Microsoft 
len ratingfive I have to use it for work so I can t use Slack 
len ratingfive If only Microsoft would improve their other older apps so they re more like Teams 
len ratingfour I use teams for school and my only problem is that you can t use the teams emojis on an iPhone
len ratingfive  Great app to have in pocket 
len ratingfive This will ease your workload and can improve your work productivity 
len ratingfive Best for team collaboration 
len ratingfive Those who are team player then this is a must have app 
len ratingfive Chat file video call everything is in one place 
len ratingfive I am doing this in the hopes that I will no longer be asked to rate the app
len ratingfive Audio is so much better 
len ratingfive Integration between different teams are so easy to achieve 
len ratingfive This is the oil our our gear needed 
len ratingfive Love the new features and replaced email IM and calling in a hurry and brought it all into Teams 
len ratingfive Highly productive and efficient use of time 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfour I love this better than Skype 
len ratingfour But the next step to make it Stars would be integrating Outlook calendar options 
len ratingfour Then life would be complete 
len ratingfive Things seem to be where you d expect which is very meaningful in a large worldwide deployment like ours 
len ratingfive I spent the first few times on the app simply exploring the features 
len ratingfive I feel like I haven t even scratched the surface 
len ratingfive The third party app integration is brilliant 
len ratingfive Flow is one of my new favorites 
len ratingfive Creating teams are simple and effective collaborative tools especially for large geographically diverse groups 
len ratingone It keeps crashing on me most of he times and I also mid on lot of notifications updates
len ratingfive More unified Less jump around app to app 
len ratingfive I like it so far 
len ratingfive Finally a business system that support all aspects of document filing and communication all in one 
len ratingtwo Keeps crashing every minute and drains the battery Edit Crashing seem to be resolved with the latest update it s still the top battery consumer though 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the bad experience that you had with the App 
len ratingtwo There was an issue with the last update that caused an increased number of crashes 
len ratingtwo Please update the App and let us know if you are still running into the issue 
len ratingtwo We wou
len ratingone Update several app and OS updates later it still crashes after seconds of running 
len ratingone I ve deleted and reinstalled the apps a dozen or more times and have basically given up 
len ratingone I ve tried using Teams on my phone but the app constantly crashes 
len ratingone I have the latest updates and an iPhone have tried uninstalling and reinstalling various times 
len ratingone It s basically unusable and has become an excuse to not be available when I m away from my desk 
len ratingone  Hi Thanks for the feedback and sorry about your experience with the App 
len ratingone Can you please let us know if you have taken iOS Beta update that was releases a couple of days ago 
len ratingone We have discovered a lunch time crash on this beta update that we expect to
len ratingfour Easy to use with mobile
len ratingtwo  This is one really clunky version of Slack 
len ratingtwo The design is not good 
len ratingtwo It s slow to sync across devices 
len ratingtwo When you reply to someone s post it throws it to the bottom as if it s the most recent post 
len ratingtwo Makes you feel like you don t really have an idea of where you are or if what you re looking at is even relevant anymore 
len ratingtwo When you go back into the app it doesn t take you back to where you were last 
len ratingtwo It always takes you to activity which is extremely annoying 
len ratingtwo No typing indicator 
len ratingtwo When you copy text that have any kind of Markdown format you ll see that when you paste it none of the markdown format is kept in place 
len ratingtwo The text inside channels is clunky and takes up a ton of space giving it a claustrophobic feeling 
len ratingtwo Long messages are always collapsed so you always have to click see more Can t navigate the app very fast 
len ratingtwo When you get a notification that someone has messaged you it takes you to that exact message and that message alone 
len ratingtwo It would be better if it took you to where the message is in the feed 
len ratingtwo It just feels like you re disoriented all the time 
len ratingtwo Not good at all 
len ratingtwo I want to say it has potential but I haven t seen any significant updates and I ve seen feature requests that have been heavily voted for from a year or two ago 
len ratingtwo Teams has nothing on Slack in my opinion 
len ratingtwo This app is a very unfinished product and needs a lot of work 
len ratingfive Fastest growing
len ratingone Crashing
len ratingfive A simple and concise platform for effective team communication 
len ratingfive Teams is amazing and the mobile app is really easy to use 
len ratingfive Super thought out and works very well without lags or delays synchs from the desktop app 
len ratingfive For a tool that s supposed to facilitate collaboration it does exactly what it s supposed to
len ratingfour Would like links posted in discussion to docs on same team site to work 
len ratingfour Doesn t appear mobile supports this functionality
len ratingfive I love this app I mean I really love this app 
len ratingfive I have been able to create a new channel and keep my team up to date on the MS Ignite events without ever touching my laptop 
len ratingfour I love this app but it could be better if it allowed logging into several Teams like the O Admin and SharePoint apps allow 
len ratingfive I m not tech savvy just yet but it s simple to use and amazing for small businesses with out of office workers 
len ratingfive It would be nice to add the function of voice messages like we chat 
len ratingfive I love that I can stay connected with my teams wherever I am from any device 
len ratingfive It helps me make faster decisions and help others in an agile way that moves our work forward 
len ratingfive The chat function is much improved 
len ratingfive Took me about a day to realize that is much rather IM in teams than in Skype 
len ratingfive Also the plugins are pretty cool that enable you to customize how your team gets things done 
len ratingfive A must for matrixed organizations 
len ratingtwo Chat tab is no longer on my iOS app 
len ratingtwo What s going on 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for the feedback can you please let us know if you are still seeing this issue 
len ratingtwo If yes can you please send us your logs through Hamburger menu gt Settings gt Report an Issue 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive MS Teams offers a variety of great features that can improve productivity communication and make your overall workload fun 
len ratingfive My IT team has been using Teams for office communications and project planning and we ve even rolled it out to other departments 
len ratingfive Everyone seems to love it too 
len ratingfive It s like the perfect blend of Sharepoint and Skype and works great on my iPhone and my desktop at work 
len ratingfive It s a lot easier on the eyes for project planning compared to Sharepoint as well 
len ratingfive Individual chat channels for different projects is perfect 
len ratingfive  would recommend if you have several projects with several departments involved 
len ratingfive App s quality is as good as visual studio code 
len ratingfive Kudos to Microsoft 
len ratingfive Great slack competitor 
len ratingfive They are reaching feature parity with Slack and moving fast 
len ratingone  Keeps crashing every minute and drains the battery Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the bad experience that you had with the App 
len ratingone There was an issue with the last update that caused an increased number of crashes 
len ratingone Please update the App and let us know if you are still running into the issue 
len ratingone We wou
len ratingone Can t log in from mobile 
len ratingone Your company should really just stick with Slack 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the bad experience that you had with the App 
len ratingone Can you please help us understand the issue you are running into by tapping on Get help with signing in options on the signin page 
len ratingone That will help us look at y
len ratingone Dum sorry to hear that you did not like Teams app 
len ratingone Thank you for your feedback however it will be great to have some details around what you do not like in our app 
len ratingone The valuable feedback will help us improve and deliver on your expectations 
len ratingfour Microsoft should make it free for everyone and not just if you have

len ratingthree I ve never seen this message before and the MS apps outlook is doing the same are the only ones that seem to have an issue 
len ratingthree Help required 
len ratingfive At first I really tried to use teams but it felt like too much of a usability curve so I would revert back to my old habits of email and Skype 
len ratingfive Then I started using the teams chat feature and I started loving teams 
len ratingfive Now I m all in and using it for everything 
len ratingfive Once you get the hang of it you will become addicted 
len ratingfive Quality is very good 
len ratingthree This app needs to support being able to be signed in to multiple accounts

len ratingfour Faster and better than the desktop app 
len ratingfive The gifs are funny
len ratingtwo It s looks funny 
len ratingtwo Not intuitive 
len ratingtwo Once many collaboration apps 
len ratingtwo This is just awkward 
len ratingone So whenever I get a prompt I give it one star

len ratingfive teams has an exponential effect on productivity specifically on communications and collaboration on documents 
len ratingfive Our organization is continuing to expand our use of Teams and Teams keeps giving us what we need 
len ratingfive We love it

len ratingfive This new platform is great in centralizing all communications to one place 
len ratingfive Team meetings are excellent in quality of service to 
len ratingfive I ve been using TEAMS for months and think it s a total game changer 
len ratingfive We plan and manage complex corporate events with our own employees outside vendors and customers 
len ratingfive Teams has fostered teamwork and collaboration building efficiency throughout the planning process 
len ratingfive Look forward to watching this product evolve over time 
len ratingthree There s a lot that this app gets right 
len ratingthree I hear people compare it to slack 
len ratingthree I m not a slack user but it sounds in theory similar in approach 
len ratingthree I wish more users in my company would transition over to this versus Skype for business 
len ratingthree But it s a slow process 
len ratingthree The meeting scheduling integration with outlook isn t great yet but if MS truly puts the effort I think this will be a remarkable product
len ratingfive I LOVE TEAMS 
len ratingfive Collaboration with colleagues at work is so much easier 
len ratingfive Less email in my inbox 
len ratingfive Plus the fact that memes are built in is fun 
len ratingfive Works great on a desktop and phone 
len ratingfive Seriously it is awesome 
len ratingthree Needs some notification work but has many uses and features 
len ratingthree No sound even though that is on in notification settings 
len ratingthree  Thank you for the review 
len ratingthree Can you help us understand what problems you are facing with notifications 
len ratingthree Here s a notification troubleshooting guide for Teams apps

len ratingthree we want to move expired projects to an archival team
len ratingfour The calls do not have as much clarity as Skype 
len ratingfour Otherwise I love it
len ratingfive After using Teams I see a significant reduction on emails in my inbox 
len ratingfive This is a true game changer 
len ratingfive Probably the best product in a long time from Microsoft for getting it right the first iteration
len ratingfour Haven t been able to get any notifications to display when the app is not in the foreground 
len ratingfour Background app refresh settings are proper as well as Notifications at a system and app level 
len ratingfour Otherwise Teams is great on OS X and Windows 
len ratingfour Update The problem with the notifications resolved itself 
len ratingfour Everyone in our tenant started receiving notifications at the exact same moment without any change on our end 
len ratingfour Teams is now fully functional and a great help to our team 
len ratingfour  Sorry about this 
len ratingfour Can you follow the steps in the Teams mobile app notifications troubleshooting guide and let us know if that fixes it 
len ratingfive It s a state of the art collaboration tool 
len ratingfive Love using Teams to connect with my coworkers and customers
len ratingthree I would love to see ability to pin current location in a team chat or bring to provide location on my profile 
len ratingthree I would also like to see pictures in files section 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingtwo I was really excited about this Microsoft Teams 
len ratingtwo I thought what a great idea to put onedrive sharepoint skype and office into one 
len ratingtwo But as I played with it more and more I noticed some basic features are either not there or not working properly on mobile devices 
len ratingtwo Remember I see this useful for people on the go with their mobile devices 
len ratingtwo Notifications it works intermittent on mobile device even after I changed my settings to always 
len ratingtwo Files are randomly sorted by who knows 
len ratingtwo I wish there s an option to sort it or by deafault sort files alphabetically 
len ratingtwo That way it is easier to find files 
len ratingtwo A search function would also be very helpful 
len ratingtwo Please include this basic features 
len ratingtwo  Hello sorry to hear that you are having trouble with getting notifications 
len ratingtwo Could you please go to Settings and report an issue on your app to send us logs 
len ratingtwo Alternatively you can reach out to us via 
len ratingtwo We will look into th
len ratingthree Seems to be working nicely 
len ratingthree Only suggestion we cannot hear when there is something in our inbox 
len ratingthree Need the ability to have a louder sound 
len ratingfour Good tool getting better However the Wiki is horrible Microsoft 
len ratingone Constantly send notifications even when logged in to desktop 
len ratingone Frustrating 
len ratingone  Thank you for reporting this issue 
len ratingone We have fixed it with our latest update please update the Microsoft Teams app from the App Store and let us know if you see any issues 
len ratingfive Teams is an excellent app to use when out of office or off working hours 
len ratingfive The app would become perfect if we could have the emojis for iPhones as well 
len ratingfive That s all that is lacking 
len ratingfour I like using the app the only issue is sometimes it s slow to sync from the desktop that is the reason for stars 
len ratingfive Our teams enjoy this product 
len ratingfive It is in certain situations where notes or documents become vital these are the times the Teams app really shines 
len ratingfive  Need to improve the screen shots attachments and reports on the open tasks when working with the multiple channels
len ratingfive The only thing missing vs slack is managing teams at channel level 
len ratingfive It s bad without that capability as some of the team members should not see some financial documents 
len ratingthree The appeal of Teams Slack or any other similar service is the integration with other applications 
len ratingthree On my iPad Pro I would expect to have access to most of these integrations 
len ratingthree Unfortunately the iPad app is treated as the same as an iPhone in terms of assumed capability 
len ratingthree My iPad Pro is far faster and more powerful than my work provided MacBook Pro yet Microsoft has hamstrung its app where I am unable to edit posts where I ve shared content nor am I able to contribute to meeting notes 
len ratingthree Overall I appreciate the chat and conversation features for my iPhone but I m highly disappointed in Microsoft s lack of imagination for the iPad Pro 
len ratingfour Teams has been great for our company 
len ratingfour To be able to reply to comments in real time direct messages without a team chat and have files all in place has been great 
len ratingfour The notification system needs to be improved as this is my major drawback 
len ratingfour The alerts aren t consistent and don t always come through 
len ratingfour The software can t identify if I m reading the chat or it is open in the background of my screen 
len ratingfive The UI is easy to use but feature rich like the desktop client 
len ratingfive Every thing I want to do on the desktop I can do on the mobile 
len ratingfour Great product offers lot of convenience but still having many annoying glitches 
len ratingfour Slow and sluggish sometimes 
len ratingfour Clumsy to get started 
len ratingfour Sometimes it doesn t let you add members to teams 
len ratingfour Retrying few times does help 
len ratingfour Many features can still be improved like say Commenting on others work 
len ratingfour Is still basic could have been done as an overlay layer 
len ratingfour So any doc can be commented on without disturbing the actual document comments are shown layered on top of the document being commented 
len ratingfour Having said that this is perhaps the best likely future of collaborative work 
len ratingfour It s great 
len ratingfour perhaps next windows of MS 
len ratingtwo  Haven t been able to get any notifications to display when the app is not in the foreground 
len ratingtwo Background app refresh settings are proper as well as Notifications at a system and app level 
len ratingtwo Otherwise Teams is great on OS X and Windows 
len ratingtwo  Sorry about this 
len ratingtwo Can you follow the steps in the Teams mobile app notifications troubleshooting guide and let us know if that fixes it 
len ratingone  Cannot give app feedback because I use Outlook app not OS mail accounts 
len ratingone Says needs email account 
len ratingone Search for message shows message but clicking on it does not show it in chat history 
len ratingone This is multi year user with lots of messages 
len ratingfour Teams makes it easy to scope a collaboration space to specific team members share documents resources collaborate on tasks through transactional exchanges 
len ratingfour However unlike Slack it does not encourage conversation banter or team building through it s UI design 
len ratingfour This is it s greatest shortcoming 
len ratingfour  Thank you for the feedback Ryan 
len ratingfour Can you share some examples to help us understand how we can improve the experience on Teams 
len ratingthree  Needs some notification work but has many uses and features 
len ratingthree  Thank you for the review 
len ratingthree Can you help us understand what problems you are facing with notifications 
len ratingthree Here s a notification troubleshooting guide for Teams apps 
len ratingthree Can t upload files
len ratingfive This app is really responsive 
len ratingfive A world of difference from Skype for business 
len ratingtwo I ve been using this app for two days after it was finally turned on for GCC and am not getting any notifications in iOS 
len ratingtwo Notifications in other client platforms work fine but they only show up in iOS when the phone is unlocked and the app is already open 
len ratingtwo Without notifications Teams is pretty useless 
len ratingtwo It sounds like they re working for others but no one in my organization so I m not sure what the issue is 
len ratingtwo I ve submitted a bug report so please take a look Microsoft 
len ratingtwo  Sorry about this and thank you for reporting this 
len ratingtwo We are looking into it and will get back to you soon 
len ratingfive Created many collaborations across teams 
len ratingfive Skype integration is great however on the Skype it shows as in call but truly I m attended a meeting 
len ratingfive It should reflect true attribute of the call 
len ratingfive I really like TEAMS although there could be improvements 
len ratingfive I would like to have more availability with calendaring 
len ratingfive I know it s supposed to communicate with Outlook and we are still trying to get this set up 
len ratingfive However when I add a meeting and assign it to a team member I cannot add me to the meeting 
len ratingfive So it does not show on my calendar of events 
len ratingfive Cannot live without this app Since everyone and everything is integrated it helps me not feel distracted with email and IM I also love that one note is integrated As well as sharepoint Now everything is in the same place
len ratingfour  Works incredible 
len ratingfour No complaints here 
len ratingfive Everyone at work loves this software for phone and desktop 
len ratingfive We just changed over from slack and we are definitely impressed 
len ratingfive We use this as a communication platform where I work 
len ratingfive Its great when you use it to organize teams and make sure to communicate on the appropriate channel for future reference purposes 
len ratingfive Has built in personal Wikis and tons of rd party addins 
len ratingfive We dont use a lot of the features available but overall we like it 
len ratingfive We were kind of thinking about using slack for communication but this works just as well 
len ratingfive Its just not as simple to use at first 
len ratingfour Can we get more participants in our chat rooms 
len ratingfour I can only get but we have more people on our team than that 
len ratingfive There are many collaboration tools out there and not one of them is perfect but Teams comes close 
len ratingfive It truly takes the workplace HUB to a new level by extending all of Microsoft has to over that co workers already use 
len ratingfive No to mention how open and flexible a the platform is to incorporate non Microsoft products as well 
len ratingfive Highly recommend this over WebEx Teams or Slack
len ratingfour Teams is already proving itself to be far better that Skype for Business and has helped our group to work together 
len ratingfour The mobile app is missing a few things compared to its desktop counterpart however 
len ratingfour The single biggest thing being able to schedule meetings 
len ratingfour I know that Outlook can schedule a meeting for Skype for Business but being able to schedule a meeting right from the Teams app would mean that regardless of the email client or device we can plan and meet trough Teams 
len ratingfour That is huge 
len ratingfour Keep up the good work 
len ratingfour Why doesn t a notification come for messages sent in team groups 
len ratingfour I get notifications only for chats 
len ratingfour Teams is awesome 
len ratingfour Microsoft is rolling out features from Skype for Business SB into Teams 
len ratingfour But to fully replace SB much work is needed 
len ratingfour I m looking forward to working on Teams exclusively 
len ratingfour ETA for that is a few months out IMHO 
len ratingfive This is the best app for all your communication needs for your company 
len ratingtwo In the latest release I can no longer join a call or call someone from chat 
len ratingtwo Voice seems to be gone from the Apple app product 
len ratingtwo It still works on the desktop though 
len ratingfive Saves time for short conversations and Qwik answers 
len ratingfive Homerun Microsoft 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingthree Update I currently am not able to do video chats via my iPhone 
len ratingthree This previously was a feature 
len ratingthree My iPhone is update 
len ratingthree When will video chat be a restored feature for the app 
len ratingthree  I ve been worked on several projects over the years to help get team collaboration to be clear and effective 
len ratingthree I think Microsoft teams has that potential compared to other programs I have used 
len ratingthree Right now though on the mobile app iOS I am unable to add files wiki pages or websites under the tab feature 
len ratingthree I hope this will change in the next update 
len ratingthree I work mainly from my iOS Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingthree Video chat should be disabled for you only if it is disabled by your organization settings 
len ratingthree There were no changes in this update that should effect availability of this feature 
len ratingthree Can you please report the issue through Hamburg

len ratingfour I like Teams 
len ratingfour It helps me communicate with the office when I am out 
len ratingfour I would like the notifications to be more noticeable customizable on this app 
len ratingfive Loving it very intuitive 
len ratingfive Better than any other business collaboration tool I have used 
len ratingfour I like the concept and happy that Microsoft is making a proactive approach to truly integrate their product portfolio 
len ratingfour Really excited to try this with my team and create better work flows 
len ratingfour One thing I that is missing is that there is a screen sharing option on the desktop option while this option might not be available a white board option which can be used during group calls can go along way in communication and alignment 
len ratingfour Please off some type of Apple Pencil support

len ratingtwo Want to add sort create groups and contacts 
len ratingfive Been using Skype for business kept losing messages and out of sync 
len ratingfive Team much better and able to collaborate more than ever 
len ratingthree MS needs to have a sharper focus on collaboration and integration 
len ratingthree There s way too much leaving one place to get to another now 
len ratingthree Goals differ from tasks that s another short fall 
len ratingthree Tracking progress needs to be another focus 
len ratingthree The suite of apps could be great and I think it will happen the sooner the better

len ratingtwo If I look up the person in my address book within the app it populated that person in the recent calls but is wiped each time I close the app 
len ratingtwo  How do I initiate multiple calls without CallKit lock screen 
len ratingtwo Cannot Tap and hold a phone number in an email or website to select teams dial like Skype biz can 
len ratingtwo Cannot organize the new contact groups 
len ratingtwo Want to add sort create groups and contacts 
len ratingthree I cannot do multi select and remove users from a group 
len ratingthree Very painful 
len ratingfive It s an awesome
len ratingfive It works just as well and effective as on the PC
len ratingtwo  The app s callerID does not reference my address book 
len ratingtwo Recent call history does not either 
len ratingtwo Locking the screen without headphones drops a call 
len ratingtwo  Cannot schedule a meeting in iOS app 
len ratingfive Very easy and comprehensive laws me to stay in the loop 
len ratingfive Wish if I could message myself 
len ratingfive It would make sending files to myself a breeze 
len ratingfive Needed this for school and it did its job 
len ratingfive Great app to communicate with teams organization 
len ratingfour We use Teams at my company so we can communicate across different IT platforms easily 
len ratingfour We create the different groups and can add people so everyone can be aware 
len ratingfour It is very easy to use my only drawback from using it for at least over a year is it is very buggy on start up 
len ratingfour Don t put it in your Start up menu start it up later once other programs are already up 
len ratingfour We are looking into other apps for collaboration and for Agile but this is pretty great 
len ratingfour Lots of great features live chat chat which saves history access to files communication to your whole team etc 
len ratingfour I would rate stars if Teams would sort files alphabetically automatically frustrating to have to initiate a sort everytime to locate files 
len ratingfour With my team
len ratingone Slow hard to find and navigate through channels the UI design is not fun and easy
len ratingone Where is the voice calling after upgrading the latest version 
len ratingone  I ve tried using Teams on my phone but the app constantly crashes 
len ratingone I have the latest updates and an iPhone have tried uninstalling and reinstalling various times 
len ratingone It s basically unusable and has become an excuse to not be available when I m away from my desk 
len ratingone  Hi Thanks for the feedback and sorry about your experience with the App 
len ratingone Can you please let us know if you have taken iOS Beta update that was releases a couple of days ago 
len ratingone We have discovered a lunch time crash on this beta update that we expect to
len ratingthree Teams taking over for Skype does not work well especially when you have more than one account to interact with 
len ratingfive Ver usable app that seems to have complete parity with desktop app and web version 
len ratingfive I rely heavily for chat joining calls finding and reviewing documents etc 
len ratingfive Invaluable application service for mobile professionals 
len ratingthree  The app s callerID does not reference my address book 
len ratingthree Recent call history does not either 
len ratingthree If I look up the person in my address book within the app it populated that person in the recent calls but is wiped each time I close the app 
len ratingfive Wohooo
len ratingfour I really like the way this application allows you to communicate and collaborate with your peers in the work place 
len ratingfour Have not used the application to its full potential and still it has exceeded my expectations 
len ratingfour Well done 
len ratingfive Best app
len ratingthree  I use Teams for my company team communications 
len ratingthree In all it s a good app but there are a few limitations that must be overcome for it to be great namely when sharing a link the app should load a preview like whatsapp does so people can have an idea of what the link is for 
len ratingthree  when sharing videos the app just says MP where it should show a still from the video like whatsapp does 
len ratingthree  photos being shared are slow to load 
len ratingthree  there should be the ability to have read receipts for messages 
len ratingthree With the above my team would enjoy it more 
len ratingone I have all the notifications turned on for the app through iOS settings and on it app itself but do not receive them on the lock screen 
len ratingone This is a huge issue and there is no remedy anywhere online 
len ratingthree Please add to be able to send audio messages and dictation
len ratingfive My team and I share lots of info there 
len ratingfive Calls and documents chats 
len ratingfive Everything 
len ratingfive An app you can trust
len ratingfive Teams is an amazing concept from Microsoft 
len ratingfive It lets me chat group chat store documents wiki video calls 
len ratingfive This is amazing tool to collaborate and communicate 
len ratingfive Teams brings so many great aspects of collaboration together in a great Microsoft tool 
len ratingfive Love the mobile app 
len ratingfour Hard to complain about the app it gives you virtually all the Teams features on the go and is pretty great on its own merits 
len ratingfour Teams itself still has a lot of catching up to do in some obvious areas like lacking a group calendar LOL 
len ratingfive This App maximized collaboration within my team 
len ratingfive We are always connected and easy to follow up with our tasks 
len ratingfive Having channels and different groups lets us have an uncluttered experience share files and doc 
len ratingfive I have been very impressed with this first generation of this app 
len ratingfive The key is your organization needs to be using Teams effectively to be successful 
len ratingfive Would be nice if the Connected Apps on tabs were available 
len ratingfive Also a bit interested if this app will evolve now that more Skye for Business features are being introduced 
len ratingfive Easy to use and love that the push notifications are accurate and come in real time 
len ratingfive Helps me be more reliable and responsive 
len ratingfour I ve only spent a couple of weeks using it but the app has worked very well so far 
len ratingfour My only gripe is that you currently cannot delete message threads 
len ratingfour Not sure why that isn t available as it seems like a pretty standard feature 
len ratingone The mechanism Team uses for sharing the documents is pathatic skype is much much better than team No option to search history
len ratingone  This is almost a great app except for some major flaws 
len ratingone I try to use Teams with different companies and guest access is a nightmare 
len ratingone Also Skype for Business does not integrate with voice video calls in a meeting 
len ratingone There is some cross launching it it is confusing 
len ratingone Now I have email Skype account Yammer Sharepoint Skype for Business and Teams and that is just my Microsoft tools 
len ratingone Skype for Business integrates with email presence Teams does not 
len ratingone And we now have an overpriced Polycom video system that can t connect to teams 
len ratingone Do not use teams if you need BB company or customer communication 
len ratingone It is an internal tool only 
len ratingone  you need to integrate high quality video endpoints like Polycom and Cisco 
len ratingone Microsoft Teams is a desktop client not for conference rooms 
len ratingone  you want to learn yet another Microsoft collab tool 
len ratingone Use teams if you like s era comics love integrations like Giphy 
len ratingone You ve overpaid Microsoft on Office just to find out you only use it for Email and AD and need to figure out how to justify your investment Everyone one of your customers and partners have standardized on Office and they all have IT staff willing to take time to setup various guest access 
len ratingone They don t and you will fall back to email 
len ratingone I do like the s and Giphy and my company overpaid Microsoft but still I need better guest access 
len ratingone For those of us who loved Yammer and Skype we have no confidence in Microsoft s roadmap 
len ratingfive Great app can t wait for future updates
len ratingfive We can manage team Need to include security leave like share point read view Thanks Bashar
len ratingone  On iPhone X iOS Screen dims and app freezes when attempting to upload photos 
len ratingone Teams also only lets you upload photos to a few channels not all public channels show up when uploading photos from within other apps or from the iOS Finder 
len ratingfive Very robust 
len ratingfive Has considerable parity with desktop app 
len ratingfive Works great for basic text and voice chat 
len ratingfive Access to collaboration content is a huge bonus 
len ratingfour Needs the ability to record during meetings 
len ratingfive Only thing I wish is it would keep u logged in unless u requested otherwise
len ratingfive V cool app and v good 
len ratingfive Polar bears aren t as chill as the new Teams app 
len ratingfive Make a Team and communicate and collaborate with team members or friends
len ratingfive I can literally multitask with my team via my phone at the gym if need be 
len ratingfive This app completely changes how I do and view work 
len ratingfive Teams is amazing just wished it had read only write permissions so I can build a wiki without using a shared resource 
len ratingfour i ve been using teams since alpha 
len ratingfour it s definitely increased our teams productivity and the built in collaboration and communication tools are great 
len ratingfour what drives me insane are the notifications on macOS 
len ratingfour please make them native 
len ratingfour i m at the point where I mute every conversation defeating the point of teams 
len ratingfour I like the app it s pretty seamless when I switch from PC to iPad which is really useful when I have to travel light 
len ratingfour I wish documents could fill the screen sometimes I have to zoom in and out as I m reading a document I don t need the left pane at those times I d like to be able to hide it 
len ratingfour One more thing that would be great can you make the X button work when you re viewing a file 
len ratingfour I keep having to use the left pane to go all the way home tapping X doesn t do anything 
len ratingfour Thanks for putting this together I appreciate that there is an iPad version 
len ratingthree Has issues on VPN
len ratingfour Only issue I ve had with this app is sometimes I won t get chat messages until hours after they were sent 
len ratingfour Other notifications get delayed as well but it s much more frequent with the chat notifications 
len ratingfour I ve been using the whole suite of office apps and I gotta say they re really good 
len ratingfour Teams makes it easy to communicate with my colleagues when I m on the road and it s connected to all our other office apps 
len ratingfive Teams a perfect rip off slack 
len ratingfive App is well executed
len ratingfive One of the better apps Microsoft has produced
len ratingtwo We ve started using Teams in my office 
len ratingtwo Overall it is a decent product but has some huge glaring holes I ve noticed for iOS and MacOS users 
len ratingtwo For example I cannot edit the timing of a meeting on the iOS app even if I am the meeting creator 
len ratingtwo Also links to new teams or folders are not supported 
len ratingtwo How the heck am I supposed to join a team if the link to it doesn t work 
len ratingfive First price of software from Microsoft that I ve enjoyed using in a LONG time 
len ratingthree A lot of video issues
len ratingfour Easy to connect to my work and teams while out of the office 
len ratingfour Just need to get everybody on board 
len ratingfour Not as good as Facebook Workspace but does the job 
len ratingfour Occasionally out of day notifications 
len ratingfour Needs to support multiple Office accounts 
len ratingfour We have multiple companies 
len ratingfour Teams has been great for our company 
len ratingfour We ve been able to increase communications between typically unlinked groups and increased understanding 
len ratingfour Two missing features that should be a MUST 
len ratingfour Private channels within a team especially for managers 
len ratingfour Scan directly to a Team Folder
len ratingfive I wish that when you edit a uploaded document it change the original as well 
len ratingfive Or at least changed it within other teams 
len ratingfive That s if the document is another team folders 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Use it extensively in our company 
len ratingfive No more internal mails 
len ratingfive Would love if there is an option to add reminders tasks from the conversation
len ratingtwo  Would like to see more useful items when it comes using this product 
len ratingtwo For example 
len ratingtwo I would like to see date and time stamp on each message 
len ratingtwo I would like to see a way to have this use within outlook 
len ratingtwo There could be more great tools if Microsoft would look at other collaboration tools from other companies and use them with Teams 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingtwo You can reveal the timestamps for individual messages using a left drag gesture on chat view 
len ratingtwo We are following the same pattern as iMessage to make the experience more familiar for iOS users but thanks for the feedback and we wil
len ratingfive Would really like the ability to change font size 
len ratingfive  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive If you change the font size in the iOS Settings app Settings gt General gt Accessibility gt Larger Font that will change the font within the Teams app as well 
len ratingone Why does this app not work consistently 
len ratingone Every time I try to open it it s a crapshoot 
len ratingone I usually just get a blank screen and then I have to kill it and restart my iPhone before it works again 
len ratingone Will this be fixed 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry about the inconvenience caused 
len ratingone Can you please report the problem through Hamburger gt Settings gt Report an issue 
len ratingone This will help us look up the logs and find the problem that you are running into 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive  A few updates ago the chat and team chat views and replies now take up the whole screen removing the tabs from the bottom 
len ratingfive This forces you to use the top left back nav consistently and not an improvement over the previous version 
len ratingfive Please revert this change my home button and thumb thank you 
len ratingfive  stars instead of now because of this awful change 
len ratingone In a team channel most of the tabs open in a web browser 
len ratingone What s the point of a app if everything opens in the web browser 
len ratingone Functionality is too limited 
len ratingfive very good app to use if you re already on Office
len ratingfive Does app store reviews even work 
len ratingfive See no new reviews since Jan
len ratingfive It works 
len ratingfive Well thought out 
len ratingfive Can be made little more better I am sure Microsoft is on it 
len ratingfive Excellent app 
len ratingone I really don t get Microsoft at all they take any concept and will try to implement it but it will always be worse 
len ratingone This app is no exception didn t load the conversation and files 
len ratingone Takes forever to load any project Am using iPhone s plus
len ratingfour I really like this app 
len ratingfour Despite my title 
len ratingfour It tends to work well 
len ratingfour And the features are pretty good 
len ratingfour Even though I m kind of new to the app 
len ratingfour I expect the development of the app to be further then it is 
len ratingfour As it is a business class app 
len ratingfour It has some little quirks with file sizes 
len ratingfour And notifications 
len ratingfour Ones you know how to work around those quirks 
len ratingfour You will be happy about using the app 
len ratingfour And get your team to integrate in in to their work flow 
len ratingthree I work overnight and sleep during the day so i would love to be able to have a setting to not get notifications during certain hours 
len ratingthree I have this set up in slack but corporate is having my team move from slack to teams and i would love if this feature was implemented
len ratingfive In our Microsoft environment it allows us to collaborate easily 
len ratingthree Just wish there was a way to schedule meetings from within the mobile app 
len ratingthree You can do so from the desktop app but not mobile 
len ratingfive This app is looking great 
len ratingfive My team uses this heavily each day 
len ratingfive We re looking to implement this for our entire org 
len ratingfive I also successfully use this as my soft phone 
len ratingfive They have highly improved responsiveness and design 
len ratingfive This is an excellent and reliable service and not only that but this app is very well designed 
len ratingtwo Are notifications syncing between PC and the app too much to ask for in this day and age 
len ratingtwo Should be like push email 
len ratingtwo Read notifications on PC should be read in the mobile app automatically 
len ratingfour  This app is looking great 
len ratingfour My team uses this heavily each day 
len ratingfour We re looking to implement this for our entire org 
len ratingfour We just started implementing MS Phone System and right now I m licensed but don t have a dial pad 
len ratingfour Small issue but keeps me from rolling voice out to more users 
len ratingfour Kinda frustrating 
len ratingfour The other frustration is that the interface can be relatively sluggish 
len ratingfour Would love to see it be more snappy and responsive 
len ratingfour Otherwise this is a great app and highly useful for O environments 
len ratingthree Good concept but my team needs to be able to write on PDFs 
len ratingthree We can get to the Team files through OneDrive to write on them but that defeats the purpose of have a Team app 
len ratingthree Please add tools similar to OneDrive to annotate on PDFs 
len ratingfive Our team lives on Teams 
len ratingfive The conversations sync so well with other devices and it so quick to start a voice call when needed 
len ratingfour Participation is key 
len ratingfour Oversight by product managers or people in the know helps 
len ratingfive Teams is super smooth and flawless 
len ratingfive I can t wait until they introduce the call feature and Skype is no more 
len ratingfour Not bad but the sync doesn t work properly with the desktop app 
len ratingfive We need to share the ios screen in meeting
len ratingone Just vaporizes randomly 
len ratingone Not many other apps open 
len ratingone Prior version did not have this problem 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback 
len ratingone We are sorry to hear about your experience 
len ratingone Can you please update to the latest version of the App that we released today and let us know if you are still seeing this issue 
len ratingone If it doesn t please report the issue to us
len ratingfour The app is a powerhouse 
len ratingfour I love the direction it s heading and we use it solely for chat in our organization 
len ratingfour Some improvements simplify simplify simplify 
len ratingfour Less clicks to arrive at the proper chat add teams to the outlook mobile app calendar invite like you can do with Skype 
len ratingfour I know power and simplicity can sometimes be a tricky balance 
len ratingfour But the learning curve is not nearly as fast as say groupme 
len ratingfour Looking forward to seeing this evolve 
len ratingtwo Teams is functional and has a nice UI 
len ratingtwo It has two major problems 
len ratingtwo The app frequently crashes while typing messages or navigating and it is often slow to update messages that are appearing in the same app on other devices 
len ratingfive  And able to tame to communicate more quickly 
len ratingfive Needed improvement it should be more clear when you are replying instead of creating a new conversation 
len ratingthree Love the call quality on Teams it s one of the clearest in the VOIP space 
len ratingthree The other collaboration features feel overly basic thing like search doesn t really help you get to where you want to be 
len ratingthree Microsoft this could be a great collaboration app don t make it so average 
len ratingone When it s been a while since I have opened the app trying to do so results in the app crashing after just a few seconds 
len ratingone I open it again and within a few seconds it crashes again 
len ratingone I have to repeat this about times then it will finally run successfully 
len ratingone These crashes seem to related to the app trying to sync up 
len ratingone It s like it can load a little of the new activity at each attempted startup and once it s gotten fully synced it s good and has no further issues 
len ratingone  Thanks for the feedback and sorry to hear about your experience 
len ratingone Can you please report the issue from Hamburger menu gt Settings gt Report an Issue 
len ratingone This will help us track down the issue that you are running into and make a fix available to
len ratingfive  An ease of use app hope the message can receive and delivered with skype
len ratingone Unless I can t find it this is a complete deal breaker 
len ratingone Can t use in the car then can t use
len ratingfive Perfect means of keeping in contact 
len ratingfive Bring back the purple UI 
len ratingone Terrible update can t even access my teams anymore 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback and sorry to hear about your experience 
len ratingone Can you please send us your logs from hamburger menu gt settings gt Report an Issue 
len ratingone This will help us investigate the issue and get it fixed faster 
len ratingone Also please let us know i
len ratingthree I want to upload video files 
len ratingfive We use it extensively
len ratingfive We are a small office and Teams is fantastic to communicate 
len ratingfive It s getting better and better 
len ratingfive Planner is now part of Teams 
len ratingfive Files are within specific groups 
len ratingfive I ve used since it was released and it is now really coming to full steam 
len ratingfive Also didn t take intensive training to get people up to speed on how to use 
len ratingfour I ve used flowdock for years 
len ratingfour Simple and reliable push messages 
len ratingfour Teams is not as simple and it s a struggle to configure the push notifications so they reliably show up 
len ratingfive Please add the ability for guest users to switch tenants 
len ratingfive Extremely important and Android has this feature 
len ratingfive What gives 
len ratingfive  You can now switch tenants on iOS too 
len ratingtwo it s never works as slack
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive This app allows me to communicate while in the office and when on the road with my remote team 
len ratingfive Combined with other apps products we are in constant and consistent collaboration 
len ratingfive No one has to wait on the other 
len ratingfive Everything gets done in real time 
len ratingfive MS Teams has been a wonderful new way to communicate within our organization 
len ratingfive Emails are way down and we love the focused communication within the channels 
len ratingfive My only wish is that the mobile app will eventually mirror the functionality of the desktop version 
len ratingfive  The app is very simple and is very easy to navigate through 
len ratingfour Chat and group chat options functionally Teams is very similar to Slack but I think integration across many other Office apps OneNote etc 
len ratingfour gives Teams an edge 
len ratingfour The UI does feel less slick more dated and somehow less snappy than some other players in this space I m not sure how to articulate what i find problematic or underwhelming about the interface or it s overall design but it just feels inherently corporate and less personal perhaps more personality and personalization options could improve this aspect of the software fun avatars voice memos active background images logo and brand integration spring to mind 
len ratingfour With Web Desktop App for Mac and PC as well as mobile App offerings I can be accessible everywhere to my teams and the video conferencing and call options are pretty slick so far as well 
len ratingfour Good job overall M 
len ratingone Calls make my iPhone very hot drains battery very quickly 
len ratingone Finally it killed my new battery 
len ratingfive I love what Microsoft is doing with teams and this app is helping me collaborate into new ways
len ratingone Absolutely useless can t sign into more than account 
len ratingone Even if you tell the app to use a different account it gets in an endless loop 
len ratingone Uninstalling and reinstalling to change accounts then search doesn t work at all More useless crap from Microsoft 
len ratingfive Love this waaaaaay more than Skype for Business 
len ratingfive Seems a little more seamless and with more features 
len ratingfive And the UI in my opinion is just better overall 
len ratingfour Need the ability to collapse all teams for ease of viewing multiple teams 
len ratingfour Otherwise a good app 
len ratingfive Well designed app with all the functionality needed to be productive on the go
len ratingthree I wish I could view more than one team window at a time 
len ratingfour The stability of the audio quality and screen sharing capability for TEAMS as compared to LYNC or the updated SKYPE FOR BUSINESS is MUCH better than the older two 
len ratingfour Wish Microsoft would allow easier switching between TEAMS I have to completely log out and completely re authenticate to log into the other team 
len ratingfour In Slack it s a simple click to switch teams 
len ratingfour Fix that and my day would be much more sunny than it is now 
len ratingfour I am a student and all of my classes are through this program but I can t use it at all on mobile because there is no way for me to see any of my assignments 
len ratingfour The old Classroom app worked fine with its mobile users being able to see and turn in assignments 
len ratingfour But I mainly used it to start or prepare for work to do later 
len ratingfour And if I don t have my laptop out and ready but my classmate asks me what the homework was I couldn t just pull out my phone and tell him 
len ratingfour Edit Thank you for adding it Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfour We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo  The teams app soooo cool however there is a red dot on the app indicating a notification and every time I go into the app and then get off it s still there 
len ratingtwo I have no notifications in the app 
len ratingtwo So why is the number still there saying that there is a notification 
len ratingtwo  please fix this because it is annoying 
len ratingfour I could send a reply from my Apple Watch 
len ratingfour It is great that it will show you the notification we need to be able to reply 
len ratingthree  I ve been worked on several projects over the years to help get team collaboration to be clear and effective 
len ratingthree I think Microsoft teams has that potential compared to other programs I have used 
len ratingthree Right now though on the mobile app iOS I am unable to add files wiki pages or websites under the tab feature 
len ratingthree I hope this will change in the next update 
len ratingthree I work mainly from my iOS
len ratingfive Best app ever 
len ratingfive We use it for everything technical 
len ratingfour Love the tool wish the client would Support more than one portal at a Time 
len ratingfour I am on a few team on different portals 
len ratingfour More like OneNote letting you connect to more than one portal 
len ratingfive Great integration 
len ratingfour One of the missing keys 
len ratingfour Can t give more than because Teams still needs a few more features to make it a great LMS system for schools 
len ratingfour  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfour We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfour Everything works great except that you receive redundant notifications on your computer and phone at the same time 
len ratingfour Also you will often receive emails telling you that you ve missed a message in Teams in the last hour when you haven t missed anything 
len ratingfour Doesn t allow you to delete conversations 
len ratingfive Teams is everything that one could ask for in a group collaboration platform 
len ratingfive It lets you do many more things than Slack in line editing of documents is one such thing and there are many 
len ratingfour Loving Teams on mobile 
len ratingfour Allows me to jump into deep collaborative threads and scan through documents amazingly quick dependent on internet connection 
len ratingfour Been a productivity booster for sure 
len ratingfive Teams is a pretty good for collaborating on projects and in teams 
len ratingfive The app works well 
len ratingfive Just missing a few features on mobile scheduling meetings 
len ratingfive But definitely a good experience
len ratingfive Love the Teams app great way to stay connected with teams and projects 
len ratingfive Have been using the app for a while 
len ratingfive It s responsive 
len ratingfive The interface is intuitive 
len ratingthree Microsoft has always lagged in the app dept and it seems everyone beats them to the market with innovation 
len ratingthree Office is starting to get it together and decide what it wants to be 
len ratingthree Teams is a solid platform to get your company using these tools and this app is solid 
len ratingthree It needs a ton of tweaks but the simplicity built into the initial design is worthy of respect and I hope that doesn t get lost with upgrades 
len ratingthree It needs to stay simple so people and figure it out on their own 
len ratingthree But it needs to evolve and gain some more robust features 
len ratingfive Great for collaboration 
len ratingthree  Very annoying that push notifications don t sync with your activity on PC 
len ratingthree Have to launch the app to clear read notifications and updates etc 
len ratingone Also the search for recipients field is broken 
len ratingone After tapping on your result the field remains blank Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone We are not aware of any such issue with the update 
len ratingone The update should neither clear your chat history not cause any issue with chat recipient selection 
len ratingone Can you please report the issue from Hamburger gt Settings so that we can
len ratingfour I like teams desktop and mobile 
len ratingfour Clean interface no syncing issues 
len ratingfour Very effective communication and collaboration tool 
len ratingfour However and this is s big one with thousands of votes unbelievable that the end user cannot delete conversations 
len ratingfour I don t want to delete individual messages 
len ratingfour If I no longer want or need an entire conversation I should be able to delete it 
len ratingfour Skype for Business allows companies to disable saving conversations for good reason 
len ratingfour I do like that conversations are persistent in Teams 
len ratingfour This is a big help over Skype where it would crash and die when I move from desk to meeting room and therefore jump to a new WiFi hotspot 
len ratingfour Let me delete entire conversations Period 
len ratingfive Great app for Teams users 
len ratingfive Now that it supports sharing from iOS it will make it easier to get info to others 
len ratingfive This app is my best friend 
len ratingfive Awesome apps I really liked it
len ratingtwo It s not often I write reviews let alone negative ones 
len ratingtwo But this app keeps causing me pain 
len ratingtwo Every month I m out of data and Microsoft Teams is to blame 
len ratingtwo For starters I never use it and I m only on one team 
len ratingtwo I get no messages but somehow Chat apps dominate my data usage 
len ratingtwo In troubleshooting the issue I removed all other chat apps 
len ratingtwo It isn t until I uninstall Teams that my data usage goes back to normal 
len ratingtwo I don t know why it needs gb per month to do nothing 
len ratingfive Love the speed and agility of the app experience 
len ratingfive I can easily scroll back to the oldest messages that occurred one year ago very smoothly 
len ratingfive If I could I d just use Teams iOS as my primary device 
len ratingfour Works great generally even when switching between WiFi and cellular though audio may drop for a few moments 
len ratingfour Wish there were a way to mark conversations read without switching to them especially when it is just call started or call ended 
len ratingfive Thanks after all these years we finally have a tool that integrates o can t live without it now 
len ratingfive I hope the calling features and Skype integration get sorted out soon as it is not working right but in general the app is outstanding 
len ratingfive It is easier to get ahold of others on this app 
len ratingfive It will be much nicer once everyone uses as it was intended to 
len ratingfive Mobile
len ratingfive Deploying it within our LARGE environment and so far great success with each batch being deployed 
len ratingfive Nice Mac integration and iOS offerings 
len ratingfive Bots and addins make this a powerhouse
len ratingfour Great and useful in helping aggregate related content into one site 
len ratingfour Please enable recordings for team meetings 
len ratingfour Useful for seamless integration with team mbrs
len ratingfour It s easy to communicate quickly with the team or individuals 
len ratingfour We just started using it and people haven t really adopted the Teams page yet and there are only a few conversations but we are building more 
len ratingone  I can t seek team add button 
len ratingfive I love the versatility of this app 
len ratingfive Our team uses it all the time 
len ratingtwo Teams is awesome and I use it every day 
len ratingtwo However it is very buggy with iPhone X when switching apps it freezes entire phone 
len ratingtwo This only happens when switching to and from Teams and never happens with any other apps 
len ratingfive It s was a good app until i found out you did not have an assignment folder for classroom work 
len ratingfive EDIT very quick fix thank y all for the responsiveness 
len ratingfive  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingfive We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive This works well on my phone and so am NOT technical thank you for making it easy to use
len ratingone Don t go away when the message has been viewed on the computer 
len ratingone Would be great if it did 
len ratingfive I like that it is completely synced with my teams on my laptops and PC 
len ratingfive Very useful for staying in the loop all day long 
len ratingfour  Pros The app is easy to use 
len ratingfour It s laid out well 
len ratingfour The mobile version and desktop version both work well 
len ratingfour I use this frequently at work 
len ratingfour Having the mobile app in my phone makes it very easy to resolve work issues that come up when I m away from my desk or working different hours from colleagues 
len ratingfour Love the ability to like messages 
len ratingfour Good consolidation of messages within a thread 
len ratingfour Areas to improve Better syncing between desktop and mobile if you answer or look at messages in the desktop version the red alert circle on the mobile app doesn t go away unless you open the app 
len ratingfour Desired Features Would like to be able to search within a single Teams conversation instead of only across all messaging 
len ratingfour  Would like to be able to create a mini poll within a team similar to Remind com s features for polling via message or Twitter s thumbs up down feature 
len ratingfour For example it would be good for a manager to ask the whole team a quick question about preferences for a meeting and get easy summarized feedback without the fuss of emails multiple messages or creating a formal form survey 
len ratingthree I love the app and use it all the time for work 
len ratingthree I just got the iPhone X and it won t login 
len ratingthree Would really like to see this app work with iPhone X ASAP so I can use it on the go and keep in communication with my team when not at my computer 
len ratingfour I love to hate on Microsoft but I must admit Teams replaced Slack on my team 
len ratingfour They ve got some work to do to take the UI UX from good to great but this is a good app 
len ratingfour Super helpful totally recommend 
len ratingthree This is a fun and useful app 
len ratingthree We use it constantly 
len ratingthree It is kind of limited compared to Slack 
len ratingthree But a good start 
len ratingthree Hope it gets more extensible 
len ratingfive This application has singlehandedly transformed how our organization works and collaborates 
len ratingthree Overall Teams is a decent collaboration tool 
len ratingthree When using it without being used to other competitors methods of working then Teams is intuitive and nice 
len ratingthree When comparing it to Slack then Teams takes one step forward and two backwards 
len ratingthree But not all is hopeless 
len ratingthree The service simply needs a handful of features and UI enhancements to improve 
len ratingthree In terms of the iOS app here s some quick updates 
len ratingthree When I get notifications on multiple devices they should dismiss from all devices once I ve acknowledged it on any of the devices 
len ratingthree Right now when I read something on my phone the Mac app keeps the badge notifications 
len ratingthree The inverse is also true 
len ratingthree This is rather annoying 
len ratingthree More granular notifications 
len ratingthree I don t want to see a notification for certain channels in a team even if a channel command is used 
len ratingthree Dark Mode 
len ratingthree It s and I don t want to stare at a bright background in the evenings 
len ratingthree Please give the option to enable a dark mode to save our eyesight and battery life for OLED screens 
len ratingthree I absolutely hate having to constantly clear the notification bandage from the app 
len ratingthree If I dismiss the notification in Notification Center I want that badge to go away I ve handled the notification 
len ratingthree I believe this is an iOS system function and not under developer control thought 
len ratingthree It s still frustrating when you get dozens of notifications per day 
len ratingthree It s also frustrating that iOS receives notifications before the desktop app does 
len ratingthree My phone over WiFi gets notified faster than my desktop workstation wired 
len ratingthree It s also frustrating that there are not synced notifications between iOS and desktop 
len ratingthree If I read something on my phone I have to also go read it on desktop to make the desktop app stop yelling that there s a notification 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfive What I especially like about this app is the fact that similar to WhatsApp it allows for a conversation to take place without multiple emails going back and forth and having other emails come in in between those emails 
len ratingfive It keeps a better flow to the work that s being performed and doesn t simply clog up our email boxes 
len ratingfive I m also able to not only create different teams for different purposes but if I really want to I can create different categories with each team 
len ratingfive I especially like creating the different teams and dealing with different members of my law firm through those different groups again keeping organized those discussions back and forth 
len ratingfive I highly recommend using this app it s been terrific it has a desktop component as well as apps for the iPhone
len ratingthree I like Teams and Mobile aspect as well however I hate that conversations get hidden not deleted 
len ratingthree Why is that 
len ratingfive Better way to communicate than email
len ratingtwo Silly that we can t access Assignments on our phones 
len ratingtwo What a complete waste of a good app if this doesn t work 
len ratingtwo  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfour Share into teams channels or teams private messages from other apps or even from within teams would be great 
len ratingfour  Thanks for reporting the issue and sorry for the trouble 
len ratingfour We have released an update for the App that should address the crash at startup on the new iPhone and devices 
len ratingfour Please update the App and let us know if you still run into an issue or have an
len ratingthree Seems unpolished against Skype but understandable assuming it s a brand new product 
len ratingthree Notifications don t always sync on android and seems like group video sharing isn t stable
len ratingfour The application in itself is fantastic 
len ratingfour Simplistic easy to use a real nice app 
len ratingfour Biggest problem is functionality outside of chat 
len ratingfour I would like to see a proper screen sharing similar to skype or better 
len ratingfour I can t switch between different groups different type of groups 
len ratingfour Switching between teams is ok 
len ratingfour Desktop have no issues just mobile 
len ratingtwo The app is slow 
len ratingtwo Sluggish 
len ratingtwo When working with multiple teams hard to quickly recognize on which teams new conversations happening 
len ratingtwo The way replies shown sometimes hard to find conversations 
len ratingtwo Conversations doesn t refresh timely 
len ratingtwo Integration with Planner is done in a hilarious way 
len ratingtwo Most part of the app is working as a webapp 
len ratingtwo Not native 
len ratingtwo The app is overall slow 
len ratingtwo UI not friendly enough 
len ratingtwo Need a proper way to manage tasks in teams n take progress reports 
len ratingtwo Ms 
len ratingtwo Needs to consider proper merging of what s in Planner with teams 
len ratingtwo For working with teams have to use Planner and Teams together is real pain 
len ratingtwo also why Ms making ppl life miserable by introducing another app called ToDo 
len ratingfour Does a decent job could do much better but is fine in a work environment 
len ratingfour In general it is amazing 
len ratingfour My only negative comment is the voice communication I usually have issues dropped calls no ringing when I call etc 
len ratingfour text is great team communication is great 
len ratingfive Use it to work with teammates all over North America and Europe
len ratingfour This is one of the best MSFT apps out there 
len ratingfour Really stable and well thought 
len ratingfive Easy to use when away from work 
len ratingfive Quick and responsive 
len ratingfour Great app easy to use 
len ratingfour The only thing that drives me crazy is incoming calls 
len ratingfour If you re active on the desktop app it still rings to both the desktop and mobile apps 
len ratingfour I would love it if it rang desktop only if you re active and then add mobile if you re away 
len ratingfive As a Office shop this is the harbinger of a potential godsend 
len ratingfive Can t wait for basic features like synchronous chat read and delivered receipts and add update tasks to Asana as an example 
len ratingfive Please don t stay with emulating Slack 
len ratingfive Go Beyond as Microsoft has in other winning areas 
len ratingthree Combines the best of text messaging emailing and cloud sharing 
len ratingthree Files pictures and animations can be sent and shared from a phone computer or tablet 
len ratingthree Would be stars if you had the ability to change the notifications 
len ratingthree It is listed in the settings but on IOS and android changing the notification settings does not work 
len ratingthree Uninstalled and reinstalled the application on pine and laptop many times and this was not fixed 
len ratingthree Confident this is going to be a very solid application 
len ratingthree Definitely needs some improvement improvement before it is showcased as much as it is during the Microsoft commercials 
len ratingfive Wish the app syncing quicker with the desktop tool otherwise great
len ratingfour This app would be pretty great if it synced better across devices 
len ratingfour I often have to open it to clear notifications for conversations that I ve replied to on the desktop app 
len ratingfive  Kind of annoying 
len ratingfive Also desktop doesn t cope with video rotation on the phone 
len ratingfive Have to manually resize desktop screen 
len ratingone This application is actually great other than the notifications are awful for the phone and desktop for Mac 
len ratingone Once the notifications are fixed this will be a great program 
len ratingthree Mobile notifications do not function too well 
len ratingthree I have mine set to only if I m inactive on my desktop I always get a mobile notification immediately even if I am active in the desktop app 
len ratingthree Annoying to have to clear inappropriate notifications 
len ratingfour I really like the mobile app to keep me connected 
len ratingfour However once I open a file I am unable to go back to the main screen 
len ratingfour The only way I ve figured out to do it is to restart the app 
len ratingfour I also can t create a new team on the mobile app 
len ratingfive Easy to use and can stay connected with my office when I m away from my desk 
len ratingone We have a global team who uses Teams as our primary communication tool 
len ratingone It s worked great and the feature release schedule has added new features at a wonderful pace 
len ratingone However about a month ago that changed 
len ratingone On my iPhone Plus the Teams app started freezing in the middle of typing a sentence locking up when switching between chats etc 
len ratingone I upgraded to an iPhone X and the same thing is happening 
len ratingone It s now completely unreliable and I can no longer get through any work with the app 
len ratingone It s become unusable 
len ratingone I tried deleting and reinstalling the app but still it freezes and crashes repeatedly 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback and we are sorry to hear about your experience 
len ratingone It will be really helpful if you can please send us a report for the issue through More Menu Settings Report an issue 
len ratingone This will help us fix the problem that you are seeing at
len ratingtwo I spend probably of my time in the app clearing stale notifications that I ve already seen through the desktop app 
len ratingtwo I tried to upload a file and Browse returns nothing 
len ratingone Where did all those star ratings come from recently 
len ratingone This app was about to hit stars 
len ratingone Just scroll through the reviews below 
len ratingone I ve been using Teams since it was released and the mobile version is terrible 
len ratingone Microsoft continues to put no effort into iOS development and it shows 
len ratingone It s purposeful lack of support on iOS 
len ratingone All of their collaboration applications have had zero improvements on Apple products 
len ratingone Don t waste your time with this on iOS and only use the Window version if you re going to use Teams 
len ratingone Update Once again your update fails 
len ratingone If you re going to market to schools your app should provide the opportunity to submit work 
len ratingone I m a teacher and my school district recently began using TEAMS to increase student teacher connectivity improve access to documents and information and provide an avenue for a more digital classroom 
len ratingone While the desktop version is wonderful the app is HORRIBLE 
len ratingone Many students rely on their phones for access and the app version fails to provide the required assignment tab for full functionality 
len ratingone It s my hope that the developers will see fit to remedy this in the next update 
len ratingone Until then the app is a serious failure for my students my classroom and my district

len ratingtwo Also needs simpler navigation Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs

len ratingone Teachers as mine dc love to use online work it allows us to have the work right there With us plus have any seach engine of our Answer the teams online in office on the other hand the downloadable version from App or google store are much of a fail to turn in assignment community with peirs or Teachers and any updates we need to have Gotten from others for any schools Relationship

len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone The main problem that I and many of my fellow students had is that this app does NOT have an assignments tab so even if I can use the app to do my work there is no way that I am able to turn in my assignment 
len ratingone Soooo basically your app is pretty useless when it comes down to it 
len ratingone  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone After downloading the app and logging in to my account I was shocked to see that it didn t have the main feature I got the app for 
len ratingone I had an assignment due that was completed but I wasn t able to turn it in 
len ratingone I tried and tried to look but I could not find the Assignment s tab 
len ratingone This in turn nearly caused me to fail the assignment but luckily I have a fair and understanding teacher that allowed me to turn it in some days later 
len ratingone Overall a horrible first experience with the app and I highly suggest that you add an Assignment s tab in your next app update 
len ratingone  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs

len ratingthree We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs

len ratingone But this is much needed for us students

len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingtwo The TEAMS iPhone app is a huge disappointment for the use of classes

len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks

len ratingone as a high school student who just recently started using this program we rely heavily on our phones to turn in our assignments

len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs

len ratingtwo  Assignment pages etc Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingone This application would have great potential in making the overall effort to communicate to teachers and fellow peers however there is no assignments tab 
len ratingone The main reason we students access Teams is to submit assignments but we can t do so conveniently on our phones if the app doesn t have the assignments tab 
len ratingone  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone It s great for using outside of school because we rely on our phones but it s useless if we don t have a assignment tab 
len ratingone It would be great if the creators actually created a better feature for this to actually function well 
len ratingone  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone The only Reason I downloaded this app was to turn in assignments for school because I don t have a computer at home and this app does not have the Assignments tab to turn in my assignments so this app needs to be updated before I use it ever again I recommend to anyone who reads this review to not use this app it is a waste of space unless they fix it to have an assignments tab Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone The app is great if you don t have to turn anything into your teachers with it 
len ratingone Recently my school completed an assignment on this 
len ratingone We were required to write an essay and turn it in through teams 
len ratingone Many could not do this due to the fact that the app does not have an assignment tab 
len ratingone Please fix this ASAP

len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone Us students need to be able to work on and submit assignments within mobile devices 
len ratingone Many are having the issue of not being able to turn in our assignments on time and so many students don t have access to internet or a computer device when not at school 
len ratingone This mobile app needs a major update 
len ratingone  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone The reason I got the app in the first place is because I need to be able to turn in school assignments from my phone 
len ratingone There s NO assignments tab for me to do that on this app 
len ratingone My internet at home is poor so I rely on data from my phone 
len ratingone I can t complete my work at home because this app doesn t have the option necessary for me or anyone else in my class 
len ratingone to turn things in 
len ratingone FIX IT PLEASE

len ratingfive  UPDATE teams has been a huge help to my team as ere spread across different offices 
len ratingfive I have been a big supporter since day and can t wait to see the future enhancements 
len ratingfive Guys you have to get this right 
len ratingfive Unless Skype for Biz chat works as promised before GA you ll never see the adoption rates that this product deserves 
len ratingfive It s amazing 
len ratingfive I love it and my team loved it for months but I can t continue to ask them to use this and Skype for Biz 
len ratingfive This is supposed to be the tool that brings it all together and you ve missed the main piece that s entirely too obvious to miss regardless of which Skype server a company has you should have SB integration figured out 
len ratingfive We have the right kind of account right type of skype client that s required for this integration to work and it still doesn t work 
len ratingfive PRESENCE isn t even showing up inside of teams 
len ratingfive Seriously 
len ratingfive I want this tool to work so badly but it won t until you get the SB integration right 
len ratingfive Just allow SB users to chat with Teams users no matter what they re currently signed into and you have well over s of companies ready to dive in and use this amazing tool you ve built every single day 
len ratingfive Get it done man 
len ratingfive Seriously 
len ratingfive Just get it done 
len ratingtwo As a student this app is very easy to use and access for everything but it is missing the one thing that all students need to have the most assignments 
len ratingtwo All of my teachers post everything through that and make us turn things in through that and not including it in the application which i use for the ipad hurts us and lacks the true functionality that we require 
len ratingtwo Please change this and the app would be a true star 
len ratingtwo  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingtwo Thanks

len ratingtwo  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingthree When attempting to adjust volume in a call on speaker it doesn t work 
len ratingthree If you lock the phone while a call is being placed it ends the call 
len ratingthree Also many times the app is just completely unresponsive to touch 
len ratingtwo I like the idea of teams as a teacher 
len ratingtwo It offered a great way to keep a class organized 
len ratingtwo But and there s a big but the mobile app is way too light 
len ratingtwo Guys the mobile app needs to be able to view assignment tabs for educational purposes 
len ratingtwo Students today all use the mobile platform 
len ratingtwo Limiting the functionality makes students lose interest 
len ratingtwo Not all students have laptops and computers but mobile phones are almost universal 
len ratingtwo Open up assignments so kids can submit their work through mobile devices 
len ratingtwo  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingone Keep it simple and get rid of the desire dump everything into a Facebook style feed 
len ratingone This is useless for small business 
len ratingone Take Microsoft project scale it down to a web based scheduling tool and add in features from Skype outlook etc not hard 
len ratingone Quit building apps around agile scrum and whatever buzzword is crawling around the bowls of the tech world 
len ratingone Thanks

len ratingthree Teams will crash as soon as it gets to authenticating my user info 
len ratingthree Doesn t seem to matter if it s using what I presume to be creds passed it from another Office app or if I enter it manually

len ratingtwo Slack is at least one year ahead of Microsoft in this front 
len ratingtwo Teams is confusing and too cutesy with all the speech bubbles 
len ratingtwo Receiving messages from multiple devices don t quite feel right 
len ratingtwo I can t quite put a finger to why except to say there s an unpredictable lag and I don t always feel I get the latest messages 
len ratingtwo Sometimes my notifications get dismissed without my knowledge too 
len ratingtwo I didn t have the same experience with Slack 
len ratingtwo If you guys are hiring search me online and say hi 
len ratingthree It works but it is annoying that notifications on the phone don t update when you have already read the new messages on other devices 
len ratingthree I need to open teams on my phone to update the red notification bubble 
len ratingthree Kinda annoyed my but other than that it works as it should 
len ratingtwo Good start Microsoft 
len ratingtwo But why multiple tabs like feature board etc opening in web browser launching some other app 
len ratingtwo Please keep everything in one place 
len ratingtwo I like he desktop version for the single window solution including communication wiki feature board etc 
len ratingone Run away while you still can
len ratingone Updated since last review and after waiting a very long time for an update Nothing new very unfortunate Old review Can t share content from other apps directly to Teams No indication of people typing in group No indication who received and read messages in a group Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone Typing indicator in group chats should be available in the latest builds 
len ratingone We are actively looking into enabling share and read receipts for iOS and we plan to support these in future releases 
len ratingone For any other feedback questions
len ratingone Really think this is a half baked app and needs more work before it is GA Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone Teams App supports opening Excel files in the iOS Excel application if available on device for rich edit and viewing functionality and also supports quick preview
len ratingfive Tremendous app 
len ratingfive Couldn t run my business without it 
len ratingfive  Thanks for your great feedback 
len ratingfive It is always great to hear back as we continue to make the Application experience even better 
len ratingfive Cheers 
len ratingfour Teams mobile app is great but Microsoft needs to continue to support it and enhance it 
len ratingone This app is a joke 
len ratingone It s basically worthless for students 
len ratingone They can t see or turn in assignments 
len ratingone PLEASE fix this app to allow students to access assignments on a mobile device 
len ratingone  Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone Gotta install a way to delete conversations 
len ratingone I have old conversations of ppl who are long gone 
len ratingone I d like to delete those plz 
len ratingone Wow Microsoft dropped the ball on this one 
len ratingone How am I supposed to adopt this system when the student side cannot see the assignments on their phone where it is most accessible 
len ratingone Please add functionality for assignments and class notebook within the teams app on iOS and android 
len ratingone Until then this is simply a glorified messaging app Hey there thank you for the feedback 
len ratingone We ve released Assignments on mobile and it should be available under Tabs 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone Garbage 
len ratingone There are so many things that most basic chat apps out there can do that this one can t 
len ratingone For no apparent reason 
len ratingone It s worth paying for a different app hands down 
len ratingfour EDIT It works I just had to restart my phone 
len ratingone I keep getting old push notifications that I already read the messages on my desktop version 
len ratingone Very annoying
len ratingtwo Would like to see load times speed up 
len ratingtwo Every time I open the app it has to think for a beat 
len ratingtwo Also notification badges don t get cleared if you have read the message elsewhere 
len ratingtwo It s annoying to have to open the app just to clear the badge 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for you feedback 
len ratingtwo We are actively working on improving the experience at application launch and for badge updates 
len ratingtwo You can always reach us at for any feedback or questions 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingtwo Two things On the mobile app you can NOT view your wiki states coming in a later version 
len ratingtwo This view is super important to us 
len ratingtwo We also want a way to link directly to a folder within SharePoint 
len ratingtwo Right now if you link it only takes you to site folder not the direct folder 
len ratingtwo Once these are rectified this app will become much more useful 
len ratingtwo GREAT idea 
len ratingtwo Slack competitor 
len ratingtwo Where the hell is integration with what the world ALREAY uses 
len ratingtwo This app has most of the functionality covered except for a very important one of accepting and starting audio video conversations 
len ratingtwo Also I find the refresh and syncing to be slow at most times 
len ratingthree I like the concept of MS Teams as a one stop shop of different office products 
len ratingthree It would be great if we can integrate skype for business into teams as it doesn t work as well in macos as it doesn t in windows 
len ratingthree Skype could remain around for the telephony service but if we have two applications for chat based communications within organisations it s just confusing and the history is split across two applications 
len ratingthree As for the app I played around with it for a bit and noticed that the OneNote opened in Safari even though i have the OneNote app installed 
len ratingthree I would argue that it would be better to have it open in the app than in Safari as that s the reason I downloaded OneNote app in the first place 
len ratingthree Other than that it looks pretty good 
len ratingthree We are starting to adopt Teams and are using it a lot 
len ratingthree Really happy that there is a mobile version in development 
len ratingthree Issues so far Planner opens in Safari instead of the Planner app 
len ratingthree No apparent way to maximize documents Looking forward to seeing these fixed and other improvements

len ratingthree Clean app works well but one major complaint SSO with enterprise federated credentials is broken for client SSL certificate based auth 
len ratingthree I have the correct client certificate for my enterprise installed in iOS and this works perfectly well for Safari and Mail but the MS Teams app seems not to be able to access this profile cert during its SSO call out 
len ratingthree Maybe this is Apple s fault but it still lowers the value of the app 
len ratingthree  Thanks for writing in 
len ratingthree On iOS for certificate auth with Office products you need to have the Microsoft Authenticator app 
len ratingthree Can you install that and let us know if that works 
len ratingthree  htt
len ratingfour For what it is designed for I extremely enjoy it 
len ratingfour If I would give any criticism continue to add enrich features

len ratingfive I wish I could change it to dark theme like I have it on my desktop 
len ratingfive  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfive You asked we listened 
len ratingfive Now you can enable Dark Theme by going to Settings General 
len ratingfive Hope you ll like it 
len ratingtwo It s ok for an initial version but lacks many features that are available in the VP version that seem basic to me like the ability to get the URL or email address of a team channel 
len ratingfive Why any business with Office would ever consider using Slack over Teams is beyond me 
len ratingfive It does everything Slack does better and more thoughtfully 
len ratingfive Slack belongs outside off the office 
len ratingfive Microsofts level of integration with the entire offsite suite plus connectors to outside vendors is game changer 
len ratingfour Ability to collaborate in sections on documents is useful 
len ratingfour It would be nice if it linked into Tasks so work could be assigned from documents 
len ratingfour I didn t see that feature if it was there but I could jump over to Tasks and see the group did exist 
len ratingfour I like the integration with SharePoint and OneNote features

len ratingtwo My team is actively using Microsoft Teams and iPhone users are having the issue while they are reading the chat the app keeps jumping to the end of the conversation each time someone post to the chat 
len ratingtwo Therefore the app isn t very good to get catch up on the chat if you walk away for a bit or if you are using this to get the other shift up to speed in a perpetual chat 
len ratingtwo Note the Android users are not having this issue

len ratingone If your organization has device based conditional access set in exchange or SharePoint this app will not connect

len ratingthree  Notifications don t sync with the desktop app very annoying 
len ratingone App often takes way to long to log in or times out entirely 
len ratingone In addition changes made to created teams on the web desktop apps are often not reflected in the ios app 
len ratingtwo If I could get all the functionality of the desktop app onto the mobile app this would be a really useful tool 
len ratingtwo As it stands I can t let my team use this 
len ratingfive My users like this app would like to see some more desktop functionality incorporated but it s off to a great start and providing value now 
len ratingthree I wish the app were an equal citizen 
len ratingthree Everything I do on desktop I should be able to do in the app 
len ratingthree  With the Apple Smart Keyboard for iPad Pro you get a giant gap on the screen where the keyboard would normally be 
len ratingthree It would be great if this were fixed 
len ratingthree There s also no integration at the moment with iOS Sharing 
len ratingthree Please allow for files photos links to be shared with Teams from other apps 
len ratingthree I m also having issues with notifications 
len ratingthree I regularly don t receive notifications on iPad iPhone even if I ve been mentioned 
len ratingthree  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingthree We recently released an update with a new tailored design for iPads and added support for multitasking on iPad 
len ratingthree The giant gap issue that you mentioned should be fixed as well 
len ratingthree Are you still seeing issues with notifications 
len ratingthree N
len ratingthree  Since installing my phone has crashed at least twice 
len ratingthree Other than that seems fairly solid 
len ratingthree The afk chat scrolling is a little unintuitive have to scroll to see new messages when returning to the app 
len ratingthree The default tab is groups when I m always in chat so that s annoying 
len ratingthree Promising but needs work 
len ratingtwo  Title says it all 
len ratingtwo Looks stupid on iPad and it cannot access tabs from the team 
len ratingtwo Nor it can display tables pasted into posts comments 
len ratingtwo Needs a lot of improvement on iOS 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for the feedback

len ratingtwo That would be extremely helpful for mobile only colleagues 
len ratingfour Still a lot to desire but has been the best office app recently 
len ratingfour Helps me not need to solely rely on planner or one note 
len ratingfour Been waiting a while for something like this in a Microsoft product 
len ratingone  Guest access 
len ratingone While there are some nice features on the desktop this is an internal company tool only which is a major mistake by Microsoft 
len ratingone Everybody needs an Office subscription to join 
len ratingone How do people outside your company contractor customer etc 
len ratingone join a team 
len ratingone Slack has guest access though limited to channels 
len ratingone Cisco Spark allows anybody to join a room 
len ratingone Microsoft needs to understand how people work 
len ratingone Between Skype Yammer Lync and Skype for Business you would think Microsoft would understand this and not build a walled garden 
len ratingone This app has a clean mapping to PLC s divisions departments and other collaborative groups in education 
len ratingone Not available in the waffle 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone Login experience was very awkward I was taken to initial login screen after I entered credentials landing screen took very long time to load chat threading needs to show child parent relationship reply looks like my initial post need to visualize thread 
len ratingone I expected to see images in chat appearing in Files tab 
len ratingone Just tried to activate teams for our school district 
len ratingone No luck not available for education customers 
len ratingone  If your organization has device based conditional access set in exchange or SharePoint this app will not connect 
len ratingone Says your device does not meet requirements set by your IT department 
len ratingfive Pretty good fast and reliable 
len ratingfive Need to improve the emoji package 
len ratingtwo And keep in mind that MS Teams is still rolling out 
len ratingtwo However when I try to use this app with existing teams I find that the files shown in iOS are sometimes incomplete compared with the desktop or web app 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for the feedback 
len ratingtwo We just released an update with lots of bug fixes and improvements 
len ratingtwo Please let us know if you re still seeing any issues with the files on

len ratingfive Glad I can thread conversations to team emails with the symbol 
len ratingfive Crucial and something Slack does not have the ability to do 
len ratingfour I like the features I see so far but would like to see more features like calendar easily access team members quick meetings calls with team members added 
len ratingfour I like how you can add connectors to things like VSTS and have certain notifications integrated with your channel 
len ratingone Lacks proper integration with other O tools such as SharePoint Skype for Business Outlook Groups 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone Skype Yammer Lync Skype for business and then this stupid teams 
len ratingone Got a new message notification and saw a red badge on Teams s icon but CANNOT FIND IT IN TEAMS 
len ratingone Need to manually scroll down in order to read new messages 
len ratingone It s free but What were you guys thinking
