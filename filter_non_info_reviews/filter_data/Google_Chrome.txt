len ratingthree This app has literally crashed every day for several days in a row at least for the past weeks 
len ratingthree I have no idea what is going on as I keep needing to restore and reboot chrome over and over again and it still has this problem 
len ratingthree Google I have been noticing multiple issues with multiple apps 
len ratingthree I m starting to feel your company has gotten complacent with it s apps and products to the point where you no longer attempt to update them or progress forward with better tools 
len ratingthree Please do better 
len ratingtwo I use chrome every once and awhile and i have stuff saved on websites saved on there for if i need to use them again and some incognito mode but about randomly few the year it will just wipe away all my stuff and websites i favorite and same with incognito 
len ratingtwo it s about the fourth time it s happened and it s getting annoying at this point 
len ratingtwo i m writing this now because it just happened right as i was writing an email to someone so now i have to rewrite it because it acts like it s a new user everytime i use it 
len ratingtwo surely this is just a bug but it s an annoying one so hopefully this gets fixed as soon as possible 
len ratingthree A great web browser but it has a few glitches 
len ratingthree Sometimes it s really annoying just to get to google hangouts 
len ratingfive I wish apple actually allowed competing browsers on their App Store instead of skins of Safari 
len ratingfive But with that restriction in mind this is a great app and it syncs all my bookmarks data with the desktop Chrome app which is all I really need 
len ratingone For anyone wanting true facts on political topics Google is not for you they time and time again prove to be untrustworthy they provide biased information anything contrary to far leftist and democratic points of view are not featured on Googles platforms they will purposely leave crucial information out of pages public profiles and news websites I suggest downloading FireFox and or DuckDuckGo and compare and see for your self google is fine for everyday questions and use but for political or real world problems I do not recommend 
len ratingone I am locked out of my Gmail account and each time I go to the login through google it keeps me on a loop of verifying who I am and I can never get signed in 
len ratingone I changed the password and that just complicated the matter now the password is not recognized 
len ratingone I can find no technical support to help me resolve the problem 
len ratingone I would like tp give you a zero but since that is not possible I give you a 
len ratingone  It stops working for the search function after like days unless you restart iphone 
len ratingone Super annoying
len ratingone I don t understand why I can t use desktop version on my chrome on iPad 
len ratingone the fact that i had to use flags to enable desktop mode as default view it was ridiculous enough it should have been a simple on off button it settings 
len ratingone and now in the newest version you ve even removed that option from flags 
len ratingone What on earth is wrong with you 
len ratingone It none of your business if I prefer to use desktop version of ALL websites ALL THE TIME 
len ratingone Whether on my iPhone or iPad 
len ratingone I don t understand any of it 
len ratingone I ll definitely switch to another browser soon
len ratingone If I could give it a zero I would but I can t do I give it a one
len ratingthree I mean it s pretty decent just in case my Safari doesn t work I can use this it s not the best and it makes me stay on websites that I don t want to be on for too long I have to delete the app to get off that website would you please fix this chrome
len ratingthree Sometimes when I am browsing and my phone is in dark mode pages will still be white like google reviews and it hurts my eyes please fix it so that chrome matches your settings

len ratingfour I had to leave aol Facebook and now it looks like he has gotten into my Apple and Google 
len ratingfour Apple could go back and look for Brandon you have messages on my phone it will show my old phone number and Aol and I can t get on to anything especially Apple and Google since I have a new phone number 
len ratingone Get rid of the edit button and bring back the close all tabs button without using the edit button 
len ratingfive Google Chrome Is Awesome Just Like All Of Google s Other Apps WORKS GREAT AWESOME JOB GOOGLE 
len ratingone  I had to stop using this due to the fact my news feed stories some how quickly became porn stories 
len ratingone An adult blocker was not blocking these feeds 
len ratingone The news feed suggestions are inappropriate material 
len ratingone I am deleting this browser 
len ratingtwo But JESUS H BABIES y all need to add REAL detailed update and bug fix logs 
len ratingtwo It actually makes me want to uninstall everything google when ALL apps across the board have the same ominous stability improvements and bug fixes message 
len ratingtwo Every 
len ratingtwo Single 
len ratingtwo Google 
len ratingtwo App 
len ratingtwo If you guys want to datamine then quit being sneaky about it and put it out there 
len ratingtwo I know at least half of humanity would just turn a blind eye and go on with their lives if you guys just admitted you re one giant datamining company disguised as apps
len ratingone This is horrible 
len ratingone I can no longer save a website to a bookmarked folder easily 
len ratingone Horrible update 
len ratingone I will find another app to organize my websites 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Llevo usando google hac a varios a os y recomend ndolo a amigos y conocidos 
len ratingone Pero vi que se me estaba llenando la memoria as que empec a borrar fotos y v deos para hacer espacio he borrado m s de v deos y no se cu ntas fotos he preguntado c mo me podr an ayudar porque ahora google no guarda mis fotos y nada una estafa vamos
len ratingtwo So whenever I m on a Wikipedia when I click on one of the words it sends me to a different com so PLEASE fix this crap 
len ratingtwo  Compared to apples navigation that comes stock this is total garbage 
len ratingtwo It left me driving on the interstate outside Trenton NJ and just stoped giving directions 
len ratingtwo It knew where i was but forgot what it s job was 
len ratingtwo Its unreliable 
len ratingtwo Google map has a good satellite view and street view compared to others but it ends there 
len ratingone  The new update won t even open on my phone 
len ratingone Fix this
len ratingthree Notification badge not working properly
len ratingone I m not able to request desktop version 
len ratingone Couldn t find it 
len ratingone Why oh why can t I switch profiles in chrome for ios 
len ratingone It is such an important feature for people who use google for work and for home 
len ratingone It would be so easy to add it to the settings 
len ratingtwo As simple as it sounds 
len ratingtwo Desktop mode will make me use Chrome as my default browser 
len ratingtwo ATM I only use it to send webpages from my pc to my IPad otherwise I would have already deleted it 
len ratingtwo DESKTOP MODE DEFAULT BROWSER FOR ME
len ratingone  Safari now has safari extensions but chrome doesn t have extensions
len ratingone Overall just lacking it has the things to make it a good app but like google on a computer it uses way too much to run what only should take a little 
len ratingone Like where to find my passwords 
len ratingone Why I cannot see the google docs like on a pc 
len ratingone I have a keyboard and ouse connect to my ipad 
len ratingone I want to do serious work 
len ratingone But no if you have an ipad 
len ratingone google think you shall not work like a pc 
len ratingone When i got it and checked it it was so LAGGY
len ratingone  Please put desktop chrome on mobile ios PLEASE i mean like i can live with this but you will make me delete your apps if you dont add any form of customization so just please do this i know google is an Samsung or android or whatever but im not gonna buy one of those just beacuse of this i know thats the reason behind it but just please add some type of customization
len ratingfive  Chrome
len ratingone That s it 
len ratingone That s my experience with the Dec update 
len ratingone Can t even read an email because it tries to refresh while I m reading until it gets really mad and crashes 
len ratingone Oh and sooner or later the restore option won t be there 
len ratingone Lot s of bugs on iPhone 
len ratingone That is all 
len ratingtwo  This version feels very cut down and not like a blown up iPhone app 
len ratingone  For a company that makes millions in profits they put out a browser that has no adblock or anything like it 
len ratingone Not even extensions for privacy or even themes 
len ratingone I m quite confused 
len ratingone Ultimately Google is out to make money and they have not a care for the end user 
len ratingone  can t trust this browser or Google for that matter 
len ratingfive  I actually think it s helpful
len ratingfive I only use this for indico 
len ratingtwo  can t skip while watching video on YouTube on my iPad I m currently running iOS if you can please fix this thank you 
len ratingfour I love good for but there is one thing can you put back fornite on the app store pls I use this app so much even if I need help with my test I go to google like here is a problem on my test x like it is hard I was thinking hard as I could then I went in google and it gave me the answer it was 
len ratingtwo Constantly freezes and crashes 
len ratingfour I think that chrome works well 
len ratingfour It serves its purpose of being a browser and does it well 
len ratingfour I only have one problem with it Resetting the app randomly if the browser freezes 
len ratingfour This kept on happening to me earlier this year and then it stopped 
len ratingfour I thought it was something wrong with my phone so I ignored it 
len ratingfour Then I got a new phone and it happened again so I know it s not my phone causing the problem 
len ratingfour If this can t be fixed for some reason I would like it if a pop up asks if you want to restore your tabs like desktop chrome does 
len ratingfive Anyone see this is going to my 
len ratingone I want to watch YouTube
len ratingone The developers missed this piece out 
len ratingone It doesn t detect nearby device in the local network so can t cast 
len ratingtwo After the update i have very bad bad bad lag
len ratingfive AMOGUS
len ratingone Let us download even if we re under it ain t far it s a browser why dose it have to be age restriction
len ratingtwo Having to click twice to close all my tabs is tedious 
len ratingtwo And removing the option to undo closing a tab is annoying too 
len ratingtwo If you want to add a close multiple but not all feature why not a drag to select 
len ratingone Never fails that every time a Google a place to go the mileage is always wrong when you click it and go into Google maps 
len ratingone Yea says mile drive opens in Google maps 
len ratingone Now it s a miles drive 
len ratingone It doesn t matter the distance it s always wrong
len ratingone The once king of search engines expanded to area s it knew nothing about 
len ratingone The browser since the last update has become less secure for the company who claim they care about our security 
len ratingone The password manager on this is horrible The link between Google drive is weaker which Google drive isn t anything to brag about This browser picks up false activity within my own house It claims my iPhone just connected to my chrome browser I sitting right next to it LOL Sorry but I just have lost all faith in it so I may use on my iPad for fun research 
len ratingone On MY Phone No way The way to stay secure on a phone is too limiting online activity and make sure when online you are presented as a cartoon character 
len ratingtwo LOTS OF ODD THINGS happening when I m doing a simple search 
len ratingtwo The screen goes out of wack taking me to the previous moment of the screen that I was on when I intended to head elsewhere on the page 
len ratingtwo It s sounds weird 
len ratingtwo But this app has LOTS of bugs and it doesn t want to play well with iPhone 
len ratingfive It s great i like how everything is fast but they should add a offline feature which you can use for only a limited amount of time
len ratingfive  I can play games on the app 
len ratingfive Hi guys this lieke
len ratingtwo This started happening fairly recently but I can t click on images on the image tab when searching 
len ratingtwo Eventually after waiting a minute or more after tapping it will come up but something is messed up 
len ratingtwo Happening both on my android and iPhone on chrome only 
len ratingtwo Really annoying
len ratingfour Please add ability to easily switch between accounts similarly to how it can be done via profiles on desktop chrome experience
len ratingfive DeoGuinsatao
len ratingone Not sure what happened but having chrome open makes my pro max run hot 
len ratingone It gets really hot and causes the battery to drain fast 
len ratingone I lost in about mins of use 
len ratingone Please fix this issue 
len ratingone It seems to be on one of the last two updates 
len ratingone Wont even open images 
len ratingone If I could leave zero stars I would 
len ratingone Two updates and the app is still unusable 
len ratingone it is becoming worthless half of the time what you type in the search the results have nothing to do with what you typed in
len ratingone Why did you change the way to scroll from image to image on a google search 
len ratingone Undo that 
len ratingfive  This build works great compared to the previous releases
len ratingone The keyboard no longer appears in chrome and only chrome after iOS update
len ratingone I use Chrome on windows and Mac for work every day 
len ratingone Like most people I cycle frequently between various tabs and windows use my bookmark bar frequently can t do on this use tab groups to sort multiple tabs can t do and use Google Drive Docs and Sheets almost constantly limited and honestly counterproductive 
len ratingone The current iteration of Chrome seems like they designed it with only the iPhone in mind 
len ratingone By default it loads the mobile web pages limits the ability to zoom in and out especially in Google drive and for Google s own Gmail it forces you to use a mobile version that looks to be from 
len ratingone It s horrendous that Google s flagship browser is quantifiable the worst iPadOS browser to use their own web apps and GSuite with 
len ratingone This app could be improved so much if they integrated Sync profiles like they have for Windows and Mac proper zoom scaling for Google Drive and a bookmarks bar 
len ratingone Those three changes would make Chrome on the iPad Pro a serious powerhouse 
len ratingone If I could do those things this review would easily be stars 
len ratingone Something is wonky with how the article recommendations are being populated under the search bar when you open that app 
len ratingone In Preferences Feedback for every article or topic that I select Not Interested in I actually get more and more articles on those topics 
len ratingone And I ve been watching it keep bubbling up those topics over subsequent days trying to identify some trend 
len ratingone But the more I select Not Interested it seems to behave as it I have selected a Like button 
len ratingone Maybe it s just something odd with my persona that Google has but it certainly isn t working as expected 
len ratingthree Before and after the recent update the keyboard stopped working all together 
len ratingthree My keyboard works fine in every other application native and rd party 
len ratingone  Used to get good Discovery news articles on start up and now it s just a bunch of junk id never read 
len ratingone Also can t hide or disable certain topics like SnL or America s got talent 
len ratingone Nope
len ratingthree I am using google chrome and the links don t work anymore 
len ratingthree I do a search and when I click on the link to open the page nothing happens 
len ratingthree I am using the latest version 
len ratingfour I experience black and white on pages and turns to colors after a few seconds 
len ratingfour This happens when the page opens automatically in incognito mode 
len ratingfour Please fix it 
len ratingfour Thanks for updating chrome 
len ratingfour Now I don t have to worry about misclicking and deleting everything anymore 
len ratingfour The only remaining problem is that all my tabs will close when the phone runs out of battery or the app glitches 
len ratingfour If you can do something about that I ll be ready grateful
len ratingfive  TREEMENDES
len ratingone This is the only browser of the handful I Use that constantly doesn t shut down correctly and looses everything until you restore it 
len ratingone Clearly you don t know what you are doing 
len ratingfive It rlly just needs improvmen tbh
len ratingone Why was the feature to close all tabs removed 
len ratingone Now I have to close all of my tabs one by one 
len ratingone If the feature to close all tabs wasn t removed then why did it become a hidden Easter egg 
len ratingone This is a prime example of fixing something that wasn t broken 
len ratingone Congratulations to the nerd who found the analytical data to come up with this STUPID IDEA 
len ratingone As of late Chrome has been crashing on me a LOT and I lose all my tabs without being able to recover them 
len ratingone Unlike computer desktop Chrome when I go to recent tabs it doesn t show me the tabs from my last session 
len ratingone Instead it shows my only browsing history in chronological order ie recent things I might have been looking at but not all the tabs I had up in my last session which I may have left up for a while without touching 
len ratingone It would be really beneficial if a new Chrome update bothered to remember your session as it was in addition to general browser history 
len ratingone It would save a ton of headaches 
len ratingone  I got tired of using my own MacBook so I bought an IPad and downloaded Chrome because I need a browser that won t refresh my tabs 
len ratingone Found that if I set the Ipad down for a bit and come back ALL tabs are greyed out then they ALL Refresh 
len ratingone And I can t access any of extensions to stop this 
len ratingone Never had this issue on MacBook
len ratingfive I think Google chrome is awesome 
len ratingfive You should use kids safe search on it though 
len ratingfive Google Chrome can have some really inappropriate stuff words and articles on it 
len ratingfive I highly suggest to use kids safe search on it 
len ratingfive Thank u
len ratingthree It is okay for me 
len ratingtwo It s pretty good and all but every time I clear data and autofill data for example if i searched up fries and I tried clearing it it just wont go away 
len ratingone  I finally had to delete this 
len ratingone The news trending was promoting sexual ads and offensive content 
len ratingone The algorithm would begin to affect my email accts and Apple algorithm 
len ratingone Before long all my devices were filling up with offensive porn ads caused by the inappropriate articles this browser was generating 
len ratingone I tried going back to chrome and the news articles are still offensive 
len ratingone Even adult blockers for kids wasn t blocking all of it 
len ratingone I get a popups to install the chrome app as I m using the chrome app 
len ratingone It does it in Safari browser even though I have it installed 
len ratingone And yes I have the latest version 
len ratingone Yes I configured the settings correctly 
len ratingone Yes everything is kept up to date 
len ratingone I deleted the chrome app and switched to Bing search and for some reason all of the popups gone away 
len ratingone I prefer Google but the constant popups everywhere on my phone was too much 
len ratingone  Have been a Chrone fan for years because of the speed 
len ratingone Now it s so slow on the iPhone 
len ratingone It takes too long to start typing and it freezes 
len ratingone What happened Google 
len ratingone Starting to use Safari 
len ratingone  Wat 
len ratingone This is terrible 
len ratingone It s not getting installed on my new phone at all 
len ratingone The cloud button that usually installs when touched doesn t do anything 
len ratingone Not sure what exactly is the solution for this 
len ratingone They play games with your emotions and privacy 
len ratingone Been dealing with an account recovery for the last months and they said I recovered my account successfully and then lock me out 
len ratingone I m losing a day on the low because google is lying 
len ratingone All google products need removed from the App Store 
len ratingone They re crooks
len ratingthree Would love to be able to group my tags 
len ratingthree And accessing other chrome profiles would be nice 
len ratingthree But overall I like it better than safari 
len ratingtwo Why is it I can use other browsers to open of everything and Chrome seems to just sit there loading nothing seems they keep making it worse
len ratingone Kept getting hacked with yahoo forwarding extension 
len ratingone Today I got hacked and wasn t able to delete the extension 
len ratingone Apparently hacker made itself the Administrator of Chrome and added an extension that was not able to be removed 
len ratingone This app is forever DELETED from all my devices 
len ratingone the only reason i used chrome over anything was the close all tabs option i hate the update put it backkkkk
len ratingtwo I in general love chrome because it s so simple to keep my browsing organized 
len ratingtwo However I hate on the app how difficult it is to close a window 
len ratingtwo Most of the time when I hit the x the window opens instead of close 
len ratingtwo I know have to hold my finger on the window and wait for the pop up menu to close the screen 
len ratingtwo Please make the x bigger or more sensitive so I don t have to go through unnecessary steps 
len ratingtwo It s annoying enough I want to go back to safari
len ratingtwo Recently I m not sure if this is after an update whenever I open chrome a new tab opens up 
len ratingtwo Please make it stop doing that 
len ratingtwo I leave it on a specific tab for a reason 
len ratingtwo I am perfectly capable of opening my own tab 
len ratingfour  A lot of people are complaining about your app and they don t know you get paid for this the guy who said he will never use your app again is a absolute bully and is a fake 
len ratingfour Don t feel bad about the people that say things about you I like your quality on pictures and they complaining over short reasons don t listen to those people and keep on working 
len ratingone Buggy and slow on ios
len ratingfive Hello can you explain as to why your well respected Company Apple absolutely does NOT support my current phone number s associated with ATT and I have limited control to all of my devices 
len ratingfive  Downloading chrome always brings warm feelings 
len ratingfive Like the feeling I had as a young boy being nestled into my comfortable bed as my mother would tuck me in and read me a bedtime story 
len ratingfive As an adult maintaining a higher level of privacy security while browsing the internet for business as well as personal use brings the same sense of security as being tucked into bed 
len ratingfive Cyber terrorists and hackers are here in abundance as predicted years ago and they aren t leaving any time soon 
len ratingfive Fortunately there s Chrome always one step ahead of the game to knock them out of the park 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work and ignore your critics for they know not what they are talking about 
len ratingthree Generally chrome works every where after the last iOS update chrome passwords integration is broken 
len ratingthree It opens to a blank screen then disappears 
len ratingthree Would be great to get that back 
len ratingthree Not sure if this bug is coming from the Google side or Apple 
len ratingthree One extra feature that I really enjoyed on Android that I don t see in iOS is a new password suggestion generator 
len ratingthree In this day and age I think it s a must 
len ratingthree Would love to see that a part of the chrome app integration as well 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone The translation function of a highlighted words on webpage is not working anymore after I ve upgraded to the latest version of iOS chrome app that s very inconvenient to non native speaker 
len ratingone Please fix it ASAP 
len ratingone Keeps freezing lately 
len ratingone I guess it s time to find a new browser 
len ratingone it takes about seconds to close all my tabs now that i have to tap manage tabs and my muscle memory have to swipe back into the app then click delete all tabs 
len ratingone Revert all changes back to normal 
len ratingone If it ain t broke don t fix it
len ratingthree It s crashing a lot when I go to payment processing pages 
len ratingone The single best feature of this app the sole reason I chose to use it over safari was the one click close all tabs feature 
len ratingone This has stupidly been updated into an edit feature 
len ratingone What 
len ratingone Why would I edit my tabs 
len ratingone If I want to close them one by one I ll do that 
len ratingone The advantage was to make it easy for me to finish browsing and now it s just confusing 
len ratingone Pointless 
len ratingone Switching back to safari 
len ratingone I ve used the same email for years as of yesterday I can t get into my email 
len ratingone First of all all the apps I used isConnected to this one email 
len ratingone I put my correct password in and google tells me wrong one 
len ratingone So I tap try another way it says they sent it to my email 
len ratingone If I can t access that email why would another way be verified thru the non working email 
len ratingone I had no problems in the past had the same email for more then yrs now since yesterday morning I m locked out 
len ratingone How am I suppose to verify this account when It s impossible 
len ratingone Now I ve lost all my clients and mail and I m not sure who to be mad at but I m defiently not a happy person today 
len ratingone I never had a bad experience til yesterday 
len ratingone I need to talk to a human from google not answer one question after another to end up at a dead end again 
len ratingtwo Why is there an extra click to close all tabs with this new Edit button 
len ratingtwo Just keep it as it was
len ratingtwo There s a glitch when you re looking up new words at google website 
len ratingtwo I press the speaker button so it can pronounce the word 
len ratingtwo It works 
len ratingtwo but if I want it to say it again it for some reason cuts half of the word off 
len ratingtwo A weird bug 
len ratingone Missing a refresh button on search bar for conveniency
len ratingfive I can learn about History and I love ittt 
len ratingone Always having me reconnect devices it has become a regular thing now 
len ratingone Got better wifi thinking it would help Nah 
len ratingone Just made it even more the consuming 
len ratingone Reconsider if you are thinking about a home assistant 
len ratingone If I hadn t sunk several thousand bucks in these progressive money out but I m going to prolly going to have to 
len ratingone My time is more valuable than wasting it on these train wreck of an experiment gone wrong 
len ratingone know to much 
len ratingone Pretty huge dealbreaker 
len ratingtwo I have full bars and everything 
len ratingtwo This app is the only thing that doesn t work on my whole phone 
len ratingfive it is great if someone does not know something
len ratingtwo Seems like the Request Desktop Site button barely works 
len ratingtwo It doesn t adjust the page as it should for a desktop and for a lot of websites like Github and all it doesn t even work 
len ratingfive Testing
len ratingtwo How do I revert the image swipe to left right 
len ratingtwo The swipe up for next feature makes everything slower and there s nothing in settings that show how to change it back to normal 
len ratingone Ever since Hoogle sold out to theCommunist New World order The surgeon general is garbage 
len ratingone Rings that existed yesterday are gone today because they don t fit the communist agenda 
len ratingone This company needs to be destroyed 
len ratingtwo  Trying to do a web search in Chrome on iPad by selecting text on a web page that is open in Chrome will not open a search query in Chrome 
len ratingtwo Instead Apple forces Chrome to default open the Safari Browser because Apple doesn t seem to want its users to have any independence in how they get things accomplished 
len ratingtwo If I do a web search from Chrome then I should be able to expect that Chrome will be able to do that search 
len ratingtwo Google why have you allowed this 
len ratingtwo It s bad for users 
len ratingfive What s called a one star ratings in the two star ratings you can watch YouTube on this
len ratingone This app keeps crashing on my iPad and I need it for work 
len ratingone I have updated and reinstalled this app numerous times hoping it would resolve the issue and it hasn t 
len ratingone This app and the Google Sheets app on iPad have both become nearly unusable within the last month 
len ratingone Please fix the crashing issue 
len ratingfive Mhmmgnemhhmmmnmmmmmmmmmm am
len ratingthree Love the Android version 
len ratingthree Alas the iPhone version has no search capabilities 
len ratingone Awfully security in all applications 
len ratingone In classic Google fashion they inexplicably made a horrible decision and removed the Settings menu option from the browser entirely leaving no way to log in and sync passwords bookmarks etc across devices 
len ratingone This is one of the key features that has kept me using Chrome and it s gone now 
len ratingone I would recommend using a different browser entirely because you might Chrome will keep working in the way it has been and then their insanely tone deaf UX team will remove a key feature that you depend on without even updating the documentation 
len ratingone If you check the support page for the iOS version it still says the Settings menu option is there 
len ratingone It even highlights this feature in the app description above here in the App Store 
len ratingone This is extremely misleading 
len ratingone Now I have to embark on migrating all of my bookmarks and other information over to a different browser because Chrome is an unreliable waste of time 
len ratingone Some of the most simple tasks crashes chrome such as moving tabs around with multiple fingers 
len ratingone Crashes and all of my incognito and tabs were lost and the tab recovery is useless only recovered only tabs instead what I had of tabs 
len ratingone Sometime the gestures never work and I have to press buttons just to refresh a page or move around tabs 
len ratingone I have been a big fan of google since I was a kid but now after testing that google has altered search results to either redirect you to something else avoid the truth 
len ratingone They have also become a political candidate which shouldn t be mix with being a search browser 
len ratingone They will not stop this and actually want to go further and spy on us with their apps and phones 
len ratingone Don t trust this app 
len ratingone Use duckduck go or brave for you information now
len ratingone Just keeps signing me out and asking for password search is good will not sync accounts
len ratingone Use duck duck go or another browser instead that doesn t curate your results to fit their agenda and doesn t sell all your info
len ratingone Unusable constantly crashing
len ratingone the adblocker doesn t work and I m trying to watch kissanime
len ratingthree Where s the desktop view option 
len ratingthree It s MIA not where it used to be 
len ratingone App is not to great overall compared to Safari 
len ratingone I used a iPad Pro and for some reason when I open the app instead of everything being aligned in the center it smudges everything to the right side of the screen as if you are about to write something in the Arabic language 
len ratingone When this happens I am unable to click on the search bar or use any function of the app I have to restart the app in order for everything to be normal 
len ratingone This app needs major updating before I am going to use it again 
len ratingone I was using google chrome once and as soon as I signed in a plane flew through my house a earthquake happened my cars engine blew up I got fired my first born was takin by space invaders and my mom got punched in the face by a shady legged dog
len ratingone I m trying to get in something called we video because I want to make roblox edits for my YouTube channel and it doesn t work 
len ratingone I don t know how it s restricted and I m trying to send with stars
len ratingtwo Why do I have to keep clicking on links to get them to attempt to work 
len ratingtwo This is pretty annoying 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue 
len ratingtwo Switching to safari until it s fixed
len ratingtwo For the last month links simply don t work 
len ratingtwo I click them and nothing happens but if I press and hold I get the pop up menu
len ratingone Not a fan of downloading spyware
len ratingfive  Subscribe to nba young boy
len ratingtwo Chrome is spyware obviously and because of that the browser is much slower than ones like safari Firefox or Brave 
len ratingtwo I give the extra star because I can sync across all devices and because google is very convenient 
len ratingfour sites can hack u
len ratingone So sick of the aw snap crash page 
len ratingone They should spend more time fixing the many issues instead of making stupid messages that apparently are supposed to be funny 
len ratingone At least warn people to wear gloves while using Chrome so their tablet doesn t burn their hands 
len ratingone Apple Google are tech giants but they can t figure this out 
len ratingone My piece of junk Walmart Android tablet is much more reliable for surfing than my iPad 
len ratingone This is a review on Chrome as a whole rather than just the iOS Application Privacy is a joke with Google 
len ratingone Their grubby tentacles snake all through the internet and they ve created multiple monopolies such that they practically own the internet 
len ratingone On Email Google dominates 
len ratingone On mobile Google Dominates 
len ratingone On web browsers Google Dominates 
len ratingone And Chrome like Android is just a gateway for them to track users way more accurately than if they were using a privacy respecting web browser like Firefox 
len ratingone Apparently being implemented in of websites doesn t give Google enough personal data to sell 
len ratingone At least Chrome is relatively easy to develop websites for unlike Safari 
len ratingthree I don t get why there is a Chromecast option on the app even though on desktop they have it I always have to use a third party for connecting videos from websites to my TV for Chromecast would be nice for Chrome app to have that feature 
len ratingfive Seems like every update changes how stuff works from how far you can zoom in to now it goes sideways up and down and won t hide the site it s from and related stuff in a non obstructive way 
len ratingfive We don t need constant layout changes and it d save everyone a lot of effort to stop shaking it up 
len ratingfive Pls return it to pre days ago pre last update 
len ratingfive Edit seems like you guys quickly changed it back how it should be so good on you though I suspect it wasn t just me lighting the fire under you guys 
len ratingthree  Chrome is a good browser really close to apple s native browser safari but the UI is outdated looks a little childish and has a bad chose of colors 
len ratingthree Honestly the icons look like the iPhone s icons 
len ratingthree If they could revamp the look more clean less baby blue and let you customize your home screen background that would be a huge step up 
len ratingthree Also support multiple user accounts 
len ratingthree Other than that one of the best performing browser 
len ratingone google apps are the worst apps ever first they give wrong information next they dont work on ios they only work on ios and there is some links if we pess them you send for us viruses and you start sending bad pictures I just use google a little bit and by the way not all the informations are wrong but most of them are wrong and thanks bye 
len ratingone Google supports sex trafficking and child porn 
len ratingone I DELETED IT A WHILE AGO AND I WANTED TO DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN BUT IT SAYS I CANT 
len ratingtwo The app will not load crashes and or lags most of the time when using the search feature 
len ratingone With the new update it makes it really hard to navigate images and the previous design was just much better 
len ratingone Really hoping you revert it back

len ratingone  I love chrome and it s my primary browser for my iPhone but one thing that always bothered me was it not having dark mode like how it does on google search app there is no way to have a night mode enabled on the chrome app that I m aware of hopefully they add it soon 
len ratingone Terrible nothing but cringe worst app ever
len ratingone this is so bad it made me more sad 
len ratingone i am not happy at 
len ratingfive I like most people use this app for fun times
len ratingone  Up until recently this app was great 
len ratingone Now I have to press at least times to go to a webpage 
len ratingone Actually started using Safari which is way smoother
len ratingone I have used chrome for years but for the last month or so on my iPhone some links are not working 
len ratingone I can long press them and open in a new tab but clicking the link does not work 
len ratingone Numerous reports of this happening on Reddit and other places needs to be fixed 
len ratingthree This app is wonderful for use anywhere you re roaming what with syncing data and keeping bookmarks organized between devices 
len ratingthree That s honestly not difficult the difficult stuff however is what I need for this and other mobile browser apps to perform like dropping a cached file with greater ease or refreshing a simple update on a style sheet 
len ratingthree The fact this and other browser apps don t extend developer tools to their mobile apps is a MAJOR series of demerits that takes what COULD be a four or five star app and significantly diminishes it 
len ratingthree If you re not a developer it won t matter to you but I ve grown EXHAUSTED with constantly wiping EVERYTHING to to get a minor refresh and shame on Google for not making strides years into the mobile revolution to make that feature a part of this app 
len ratingone The newest update has changed how the image section of google looks when on the webpage 
len ratingone It is bad and needs to be returned to normal this new set up makes it very hard to search for related images 
len ratingone Open the new version and after a few seconds it closes
len ratingfour This is a amazing app for if ur a editor or roblox creator on mobile or just roblox player it s a well working app but sometimes it takes a while for it to browse but it s still ok
len ratingone It is crashing shortly after performing a search 
len ratingfive I had a hard time figuring out how to disable Reddit from sneaking into Screen Time but finally figured it out 
len ratingfive You have to go to chrome flags search ScreenTime and disable then go to ScreenTime Content Privacy Restrictions and disable Safari 
len ratingfive Otherwise toy get inaccurate and comically large hours of Screen Time constantly ticking up just from opening a Reddit link once even if you don t have the Reddit installed on your phone 
len ratingfive It s really annoying that Reddit continues to be tracked when it shouldn t but at least it stops increasing indefinitely 
len ratingone its so dog water never get this
len ratingone The first time or two that new results load when scrolling the screen will jump back to the top 
len ratingone This is obviously frustrating 
len ratingone Much easier when it was pages of results 
len ratingone Don t fix what isn t broken 
len ratingone All the animated ads slows all down and empties tank quickly 
len ratingfour When I click the lines in the upper left and select All the page is buffering but it does not happen when I select images 
len ratingthree When I tap on a link in chrome it won t open said link 
len ratingthree I have to hold down on it and choose open link in new tab This appears to happen at random on random sites 
len ratingthree It s been getting worse the last few versions including the one as of 
len ratingfour Could you please update the app to make it more robust for the ipad 
len ratingfive  I actually like this as I can delete my history
len ratingfive Good
len ratingtwo This new update crashes like times a day 
len ratingtwo I m dropping a star rating till this issue is perfectly updated 
len ratingtwo I think updates are meant to fixed crashes and bugs but this one is a bit different 
len ratingtwo I m extremely disappointed because it messed up with my outsourcing job most times 
len ratingtwo Idk if this has to do with the app itself but everytime i delete it and try to redownload it when i havent even downloaded another app or anything it always says not enough storage but i know i do have enough storage because i havent downloaded anything so idk
len ratingone Can t even keep searching for what I m looking for 
len ratingone Can t get past the Captua chrome had turned into nothing but junk 
len ratingone  Recent version get hanged for multiple seconds before responding 
len ratingone Has never happened before 
len ratingfive I can t wait to see the new things 
len ratingfive GOOD APP 
len ratingone CRASHES AND RIDS OF ALL MY TABS AND DONT EVEN GIVE THE OPTION OF RESTORING THEM ALL 
len ratingtwo I just downloaded the app because the site I am using is only supported by this browser 
len ratingtwo Then I try to use it and it keeps telling me I need the most updated version 
len ratingtwo There are no app updates 
len ratingone It is horrible that you can t do PDFs
len ratingone Constantly freezes 
len ratingone I have to keep refreshing the app 
len ratingone It s been like this for months 
len ratingone No update works
len ratingone Google Chrome is splattering all my private information all over this Internet browser 
len ratingone I miss him several times to please remove my private information to no avail 
len ratingone It s disgusting 
len ratingfive I had a screen time on safari and fire fox and now I can watch YouTube on google without a screen time limit 
len ratingfive It looks attractive
len ratingthree Not bad 
len ratingthree Edge is better 
len ratingone Deleted all my tabs after the app crashed
len ratingfive Wow
len ratingone There is not any way to zoom text 
len ratingone I googled how to do it and the directions do not work 
len ratingone  Bug 
len ratingone Constantly pushing Tabs to Constantly Refreshed like every seconds after multitasking on iPad all the time 
len ratingone It keeps CONSTANTLY Logging me out from the Websites I chose to stay logged in for min or CONSTANTLY resetting YouTube to Beginning of the Paused VIDEO even when I come back to it just less than several minutes later or pausing it for a few hours and trying to CONTINUE Watching it which is why I stopped watching anything on YouTube as it becomes Useless Refreshed not needed at all Home Page or Same YouTube rewinded to the begining just what anyone would love to Experience when they paused in the middle of the Videos or Show 
len ratingone Bug 
len ratingone Frequently Crushed Open Tabs in the previous months erasing all open Tabs and not a single option to Re Open All Recent Tabs on iOS or Android 
len ratingone After crushing it does try to display an option to reopen but if it crushes again User is completely out of luck 
len ratingone There used to be years ago in an option in History to reopen Tabs and it was there Always present but that option is taken away 
len ratingone Most Useful Feature existing in Chrome in desktop no longer exists 
len ratingone There is no longer Restore Recently Closed Tabs Option in Chrome History 
len ratingone History Syncing with other devices does not fully work 
len ratingone Please restore both and I would give star rating 
len ratingone Then at least if browser crushes all Tabs don t restore from briefly vanishing Restore option then a User has great oldest useful option to go to History and Click from three Restore Recently Closed Tabs by Date and device Bug 
len ratingone Font Size Adjustments and Accessibility settings don t exist on APPLE version maybe to help deter any users who don t have Eagle Eyes and wear glasses 
len ratingone o or not use Chrome and stick with APPLE Safari 
len ratingone Bug 
len ratingone Forced Zoom on Page does not stay on All Websites allowing some Websites take Control after just Zooming in and Tab ANNOYING Refreshing CONSTANTLY 
len ratingone After a Botched Release several months ago some websites still keep resizing text back to Supertiny size Unreadable to the point it s larger to read on an old three times smaller than iPad Android except Chrome Multiple Tabs don t work on Android for the past few years 
len ratingone Bug 
len ratingone Apple IOS Dynamic Text Sizing and System Text Size are not supported either on either of Google Apps including Chrome 
len ratingone It used work on some Webpages maybe a little more than a year ago and now after several releases it s broken 
len ratingone Bug 
len ratingone  About Years Old Bug on APPLE 
len ratingone Website Titles or Article Titles are not automatically Capturing by Google Chrome or Google Read or Google YouTube when Sharing Website Links via Google Gmail 
len ratingone So when I share Links on Safari or other Browsers the Subject of Gmail would be Captured in the Subject Line and within the Body of the Gmail prior to URL in the Email 
len ratingone Please fix this year old BUG on APPLE devices 
len ratingone It s about the time don t you think 
len ratingone Summarizing above just like on Apple App store on Google Play Store too not just my friends and family but hundreds of Users report the same Chrome issues described above plus Chrome Stability Issues being unable Preview All Tabs how hard can that be 
len ratingone  being Unable to Open or Close Tabs for Almost a few years even currently open Tabs don t have a quick close button which would not need to take a year to Execute being unable to use Chrome for nearly months after botched releases 
len ratingone Revert Chrome to what it was a year and a half ago 
len ratingone Don t waste time on what does not need fixing and focus on stopping Constantly Pushing Refreshed Content without User Clicking on Refresh to Save on Data and Dramatically Improving User Experience 
len ratingone Especially if due to recent challenging times you don t have the same resources and you will save on just not Refreshing Rapidly Changing Kaleidoscope Switcheroo of Content which doesn t need to be Refreshed and your Developers Time which can be used for Chrome Website Experience of Google apps like even basic YouTube Unsuable at all due to Videos Paused Reset to Beginning of Videos Problems with Streaming and Screen Mirroring on Smart TVs or Amazon Firestick or Google Chromecast 
len ratingone Tip to a Developer Backout from unsuccessful releases when Numerous Users Reporting BUGs and Fix them First before keeping Just Introduced BUGS in the new Releases and just kicking the can down the road 
len ratingone Don t ignore numerous users giving you Feedback for Years via Feedback and via App Store 
len ratingthree After the iOS upgrade the x to the close tabs in chrome is tiny and it takes multiple irritating attempts to close tabs 
len ratingthree I m not sure who would think that would be an improvement to make the x so small 
len ratingthree I hope they fix this issue with the next upgrade 
len ratingone App crashes when new content suggestion feed is disabled 
len ratingone At least allow users to swipe away content if the old articles feed is no longer usable

len ratingone Absolutely ridiculous
len ratingone Can t cast reliably

len ratingone All for the benefit of bad battery life and invasive tracking 
len ratingtwo Get recommended a bunch of lame self help items in new tab feed and cannot remove any of them 
len ratingtwo Used to be able to remove things and unfollow topics 
len ratingtwo Not anymore for some reason 
len ratingone Keeps crashing and periodically won t load pages
len ratingone Downhill fast 
len ratingone Every screen asks me how I like the search results eventho i answered 
len ratingone Takes too much data too many ads compared to every other browser 
len ratingone Google has gone the way of Apple 
len ratingone Just use Mozilla or anything else for browsing 
len ratingtwo  Up until recently this app was great 
len ratingtwo Now I have to press at least times to go to a webpage 
len ratingone App gives away location without your permission to almost every website you go to 
len ratingone Have fun with that 
len ratingone Sometimes it glitches out of an site that I m in
len ratingone Is this bar at the bottom of the screen every time i type anything 
len ratingone It takes up so much room but more importantly it literally covers the confirmation button of any dialogue window that comes up 
len ratingone Talk about redundant counter productive poor use of design space 
len ratingtwo Up until about a month ago I could go to google images and copy an image then paste the image to messages or wherever 
len ratingtwo Now copy image copies the URL of the image to my clipboard 
len ratingtwo No problems with this using Safari 
len ratingtwo Also I cannot download most files 
len ratingtwo I didn t realize how many CSV files I downloaded until I kept having to close out of Chrome to once again go to Safari 
len ratingone So I love chrome for MAC

len ratingthree This is really a pain in the neck 
len ratingthree I don t know how to reach support to ask for them to work on this issue 
len ratingthree Please someone fix this 
len ratingfive And add German s x movies to watch
len ratingone Times has changed 
len ratingone While Safari continues to improve in adding desktop class browsing features Chrome still can t even render desktop version of YouTube or Google com even with experimental feature toggled on 
len ratingone Let alone the myraid of other features that this Chrome a blown up ipod touch app from a decade ago lacks that safari does 
len ratingone I did not restrict this but all at sudden it says restricted 
len ratingone This is a bad app 
len ratingtwo I imported all of my pass words but chrome won t let me use them half of the time 
len ratingtwo I ll say not secure 
len ratingtwo to protect your privacy Crome will not auto fill this field but I can t find any reason why it s doing this or figure out how to adjust the setting

len ratingone new google developers keep making stuff unusable and stupid 
len ratingone this app last versions is total trash 
len ratingone keep crashing can t switch accounts using too much mobile data terrible ui ux 
len ratingthree  I have been using this app for several years 
len ratingthree My only real complaint is the Close All Tabs buttons placement 
len ratingthree I have accidentally hit it several times over the years and lost tabs I had stored to read at a later time when the app would suddenly crash after hitting the button in error 
len ratingthree Normally hitting the button is easily fixable by hitting undo however if the app closes or crashes that isn t the case 
len ratingthree More annoyingly the recent tabs section only ever stores like tabs at a time so most tabs are just plain lost 
len ratingthree If you could set it as something the user can toggle on or off that would greatly be appreciated 
len ratingone I strongly at the side of safari in terms of its features like handoff download capability extensions smoothness last but not least its interface its way better than safari imo 
len ratingone So please lookup for improving it 
len ratingone As a windows user i have to use chrome but i miss these features which is too annoying when i see person copy text at mac and paste it on its iPhone futuristic huh 
len ratingfive  Guys it s so good I m speechless

len ratingthree  The news articles that are algorithmly chosen based upon your history are total jokes 
len ratingthree I had to stop using these because they were bad information 
len ratingthree I have never viewed porn but some how it entered the thread and I had to completely wipe my phone to clear it 
len ratingthree I don t like to use my phone browser because it syncs all your data together 
len ratingthree Even when signed out it finds a way to correlate all devices on network 
len ratingthree Even after the update I m still getting joke articles that are not the least bit acceptable 
len ratingthree They relate to toilet humor and soft porn 
len ratingtwo Why can t I block suggestions from sites I m not interested in viewing 
len ratingtwo Certain sites i e Fox etc are just propaganda and I d like the option to block them 
len ratingtwo Why show suggestions that I will never view and waste the space 
len ratingtwo With your pushing these sites I m losing interest in your app and I may soon the solve issue with the delete app button 
len ratingtwo It is only on your app and I could use a web browser instead and skip the propaganda 
len ratingfive Hello It s been a while that my browsers has been crashing every time

len ratingtwo Doesn t change video volume when scrolling on screen must use physical buttons 
len ratingtwo Definitely a bad glitch 
len ratingtwo Terrible on privacy 
len ratingtwo Unable to restore tabs if you happen to accidentally click away the restore button

len ratingtwo  The links have been so messed up for me for a long time 
len ratingtwo I ve tried deleting and re installing 
len ratingtwo I guess I m going to retire chrome for a while and switch back to safari 
len ratingone I think it s time for Chrome to be updated for iPad 
len ratingone With large screen iPads tons of people expect desktop laptop class browsing experience 
len ratingone Please PLEASE bring us an update 
len ratingone We don t want to have to resort to Safari 
len ratingone We want to use Chrome on iPads so we can stay synced on profile 
len ratingone I loved chrome and used it on all of my devices but I had to switch back to Safari because of one major bug

len ratingone Whenever I have to sign into a website using my google account it brings up a full screen pop up asking me to enter my info 
len ratingone However when I do it just doesn t sign me in 
len ratingone I tap the sign in button but nothing 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone  I partner with Ad Iq which is supposedly a marketing team for Google that advertises marketing but at this point the world knows Elite Travel Solutionz as it was formerly Elite Travel before I realized that it s just not working properly 
len ratingone I use it to keep my location tracked for security purposes but at this point I feel the need to sue due to false advertising you should always be able to go to Google to find me but at this point I no longer want the partnership ide rather just send them to my Google built site to show the legitimacy of SELF but to partner with someone who I know is DOMESTICALLY known ide rather partner now with my HOST agency PARTNERS I m GENERAL PlanNet Marketing only extra per month I can literally post my own things as j have been doing using third party apps 
len ratingone Hopefully Once I explain to them what has happened they will understand

len ratingone Ok I love google chrome but it s so buggy why does the app not let me sign in 
len ratingone I try to sign in to YouTube but it just doesn t work 
len ratingone I also try other websites that need me to enter my email but it still doesn t work 
len ratingone I ve tried re downloading checking if it needs updates but it still doesn t work 
len ratingone It s glitching and I can t do anything now I feel like it s taking up so much WiFi 
len ratingone Latest update has thoroughly broken this browser 
len ratingone Links almost never work now unless you press and hold for a new tab and then it s 
len ratingtwo I have multiple Google accounts for different clients 
len ratingtwo Unlike many Google iOS app chrome does not support switching your selected Google account 
len ratingtwo I m signed in to all of my Google accounts in my phone but in chrome I can only access bookmarks and passwords for the default account which just happens to be the first one that I signed in with 
len ratingtwo Google s support docs indicate to switch the default account selected in chrome I need to log out of my currently selected default account I say selected since I not not actually select anything chrome chose for me 
len ratingtwo The problem with this guidance is that all Google apps on iOS have their login sessions synced 
len ratingtwo If I sign into Google accounts in Google Drive they will all be signed in on chrome as well 
len ratingtwo Vice versa if I log out of my accounts in chrome I will get logged out in Drive which is undesirable 
len ratingone For some reason chrome wants to stop working and just becomes unresponsive i d rather use safari
len ratingtwo  Now it seems to want to open a new tab EVERY stinking time I open the app 
len ratingtwo Why would you want to add that feature 
len ratingfour I have had this app for a few months and I love it 
len ratingfour That said a week or so ago it randomly signed me out of all of my tabs that I had on it mainly YouTube and doesn t work when I try to sign back in 
len ratingfour It shows me all the way through the prompt but never registers afterwards 
len ratingfour I know that it s no my device because Safari has no issue with this 
len ratingfour I love this app and will continue to use it but would like this to be looked into 
len ratingone I have tried over and over again t get this to work on my apple products and it did not 
len ratingone I wish I could get my money back 
len ratingone Don t buy it the headache is not worth it 
len ratingfive I love chrome It helps me because my phone is blocked off safari and chrome really helped a lot and it is smooth and cool 
len ratingtwo I am trying to type a comment in the comments section on YouTube but every time I m in the comment section the video zooms in automatically and zooms out when I exit the comments section 
len ratingtwo Why is it doing that please fix it 
len ratingone  As if the constant inexplicable crashing wasn t enough now it s not letting me click links or allow me to activate recaptchas for logins on sites that require them 
len ratingone And yes I have mAdE SUre i aM uPDaTed tO tHe LAteSt vERsIon What used to be hands down the best browser on the market has over the past months or so become literally worthless and unusable 
len ratingthree Why doesn t this app have dark mode because that white screen is way too bright at night
len ratingone Chrome is now allowing domain administrators full access to users settings extensions data etc 
len ratingone I now cannot sync my data across devices due to a work policy and would not want to due to privacy 
len ratingone Multiple monitoring and security extensions were installed without my knowledge no prompts no acknowledgement 
len ratingone I will now permanently stop using chrome on ALL devices 
len ratingthree Don t really care for chrome I ve had it for along time loaded it only when I had a chrome device 
len ratingthree No longer have that device haven t used it since 
len ratingthree Why in the last two weeks has Chrome decided that websites I have always used are not secure 
len ratingthree Or that they take so long to open that they crash 
len ratingthree I m not doing anything different 
len ratingfive U should download ASAP 
len ratingthree Please fix the link issue
len ratingone Duck duck go is better than google 
len ratingone Uou should really make the search a song button more accessible for people 
len ratingone It s been a nightmare for me to find the button even after reading tutorials and watching videos 
len ratingone Bro it crashing a lot
len ratingone Stupid and useless app always loading ads and doesn t seem cool loads ads instead of main content i hate the app 
len ratingone Glad I came to the reviews to learn I m not the only one having problems clicking on links or using voice typing 
len ratingone Come on Google 
len ratingone The ONE thing you should be able to do beyond searching is to be able to actually tap the hyperlinks in the search results 
len ratingone JFC 
len ratingfive Hi sorry I was in my car yesterday and I
len ratingone Recent update allows you to use chrome upside down wow what a useless feature that you can t disable 
len ratingone I wonder why the simpletons developing this app thought this was a good idea 
len ratingone It s super bad privacy doesn t run best but Google chrome has convinced every website to use its framework so it s the recommended one 
len ratingone I tried to delete and use safari but Google def has entrenched itself in the internet ecosystem
len ratingone simply put i always turn off all invasions of privacy google implements in all there data mining attempts 
len ratingone so why do i have to keep turn off this innvasion of privacy when the app updates 
len ratingone i m not agreeing to allow you to mine my personal information 
len ratingone i m not agreeing to a new set of terms and services 
len ratingone So my question is why do i have to turn them off again when your app updates 
len ratingone i feel this is illeage and infrigens on my privacy 
len ratingone Reviewer Brad Beeman described the issue perfectly 
len ratingone Speech to text search works with native iOS keyboard and then the text disappears before you can actually search 
len ratingone However google microphone searches work not impressed 
len ratingone Text to speech is an important option 
len ratingone I have stayed on Chrome for years because of access to all bookmarks however I think I will have to make a switch to Safari unless issues are fixed where speech to text is not an issue 
len ratingone Also why is dark mode sporadic 
len ratingone When iPhone is in dark mode and all the settings are selected on many websites it s still not dark unless it is website dependent 
len ratingone These issues are disappointing 
len ratingone  Hi 
len ratingone We wanted to follow up and confirm this feature has launched in the latest version of Chrome iOS running on iOS 
len ratingone Learn how to use Dark Mode here 
len ratingthree Tiene problemas de funcionalidad al momento de compartir un pdf desde la aplicaci n siempre sale un letrero que dice no se puede descargar el archivo en este momento 
len ratingthree Que soluci n existe para eso 
len ratingone I don t know what they ve done to the touch abilities but now I have the hardest time selecting links in a web page 
len ratingone I have to click on it multiple times 
len ratingone Often in my frustration or attempt at a double click I click too many times and end up selecting something on the next page 
len ratingone Then I have to go back one page and load it again 
len ratingone It s such a time waster 
len ratingone I used to be able to touch ONE time and browse easily 
len ratingone I ve checked my settings and nothing has changed 
len ratingone I know it s chrome and the links because typing works just fine still inside and out of the app 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone I use Chrome bc it automatically translates the Japanese pages I have to visit 
len ratingtwo I ve always chosen Chrome over Safari 
len ratingtwo It was just better 
len ratingtwo Now with the latest update nothing works correctly anymore 
len ratingtwo Number one being links can t open anything no matter how you tap it 
len ratingtwo So I m finding another browser
len ratingthree Since iOS links will stop working after within webpages after some time but will work fine in Safari
len ratingone This is unusable 
len ratingone Pretty much every site I go to the only way I can open links is by opening in a new window
len ratingone When I m on Google News and want to save an article to read later if I hold down on a link to open the Peek and Pop menu adding the link to the Reading List is not among the menu options 
len ratingtwo Chrome is my browser of choice but the newest version for my phone makes it nearly impossible to close a tab page without choosing close all The X is in a ridiculous spot and it s so small you can t tap it without opening the page you re trying to close 
len ratingone I m surprised you haven t fixed the problem we re pushing the microphone on an iPhone especially the and the is broken 
len ratingone Pushing to make invoicing text types the text but then it disappears when the mic gets deactivated by pushing the mic or somewhere else on the screen when you are done dictating 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone Makes me switch over to Safari to do things so you are missing out on revenue 
len ratingfour I have use this app for more than years and the opci n to delete all tabs has made me so mad l use it for reading and looking for interesting topics is the time it has happened to me that all my tabs where close by acidity when on my pocket and scroll over my tabs if only you add in are you sure you want to delete all the tabs yes or no button every day l use the app and this time l had close to tabs l still like the app but the problem really got to me this time 
len ratingfour  star s but once fix star ezz 
len ratingfour Hope you have a best day ever
len ratingthree Latest update has caused problems with links not opening and having to tap them in a certain spot to open and keyboard typing lag that gets worse the longer the app is open 
len ratingone http
len ratingfive I G j u s t g o t a l o t o f u p d a t e 
len ratingone Tap microphone say what I want to search for then nothing happens 
len ratingone If I tap any button at all the text I d just spoken disappears 
len ratingone The only way to use is to use keyboard 
len ratingone Will update if I figure out solution 
len ratingone I used to just love using Chrome but recently it just doesn t work right 
len ratingone Every time I push on a link it doesn t work 
len ratingone Yet when I use another browser it does work so it seems to be a chrome issue 
len ratingone This app doesn t take Advantage of iPadOS and serve the mobile version of websites instead of giving a full desktop experience like in Safari 
len ratingone You can set it to request the desktop website but in my experience the websites will be desktop friendly but the whole user interface is just a mobile app blown up for the bigger screen giving the user a less enjoyable experience than the desktop version of chrome that I like a lot more 
len ratingone Please fix and I will change my rating 
len ratingone Also cannot open PDF s anymore after the iOS update 
len ratingone Fix that as well 
len ratingone Using Safari until I see an app update 
len ratingone I am glad I found duckduckgo 
len ratingone Make the switch right now 
len ratingtwo So buggy 
len ratingtwo Would be great but crashes a bunch or links suddenly stop working and I have to copy and paste into a new tab ugh back to safari for me
len ratingone With the latest update links no longer work on my iPad 
len ratingone Please fix at once or I will have to start using Firefox 
len ratingone Chrome and I have finally parted ways 
len ratingone I can t stand that this app is constantly crashing or freezing 
len ratingone UPDATE the darn thing and maybe people will stop complaining and come back 
len ratingone Google really was THE app search engine and now I can t even use it without having to restart it at least times
len ratingone I m also having trouble after the last update with links working 
len ratingone Sometimes I can double tap and open links in a new window but that s annoying 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone As it is right now Chrome is unusable 
len ratingfour I love chrome 
len ratingfour It is so easy to search and you end up with endless safe websites 
len ratingfour All the controls are easy to find and use 
len ratingthree unfortunately the keyboard has lag while typing in chrome 
len ratingthree This problem occured after I installed new version of ios 
len ratingone Latest Update results in not being able to close any tabs 
len ratingone Touch the X to close Tab and it opens instead of closing
len ratingone I ve been using Chrome on my iPad for a while now and not had any problems 
len ratingone I don t know whether it was an update or the new iOS with Apple but the last to weeks it crashes all the time or randomly opens another app or window I m officially not going to use it anymore 
len ratingone These updates keep getting worse and worse 
len ratingone I can t even sign in without it just booting me back to the Home Screen now still signed out 
len ratingone Also the app crashes occur a lot more frequently now 
len ratingone Absolutely garbage app 
len ratingfive I love Google Chamro because it provides everything you need such as translation shopping and so on Note I love making memes on it 
len ratingone Get rid of the close all tab 
len ratingone Not necessary and I hit it way too often 
len ratingone Private browsing switching is also in a really inconvenient place 
len ratingfive Google Classroom IS THE BEST
len ratingfive Not very good
len ratingone Can t use Siri on chrome anymore because of the update I use a lot of talk to text and whenever you say whatever you re wanting to look up it goes away as soon as you tap the bottom 
len ratingone Was my favorite browser so back to safari I guess
len ratingone I normally use chrome on my phone to access google classroom when I need to submit pdfs as I can scan on my Notes app 
len ratingone However the day I have a test with an unempathetic teacher chrome decides to crash 
len ratingone And there she is shouting about how I am taking over ten minutes after the she said time s up to submit because every time I try to open google classroom chrome makes me sign in which obviously takes a while and then after I sign in it leads to me a blank page 
len ratingone I probably repeated this process ten times all the while I messaged the teacher as to why I can t submit and she s still going on and on about late submissions 
len ratingone So there I am having a meltdown and the reason she s rushing us is because SHE has somewhere to go 
len ratingone So I give up on chrome and email my laptop the work and message on my submission why it s so late 
len ratingone SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHROME FOR COSTING ME MARKS FOR A LATE SUBMISSION AS WELL AS LOTS OF TEARS COMING WITH A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I AM NEVER USING YOU AGAIN 
len ratingtwo Ever since updating to the iOS there has been a glitch with the talk to text whenever I use this chrome app 
len ratingtwo Every time I talk to text it shows it in the search engine but then disappears 
len ratingtwo It works so seldom now and it s highly annoying because I depend on talking to text versus typing it 
len ratingtwo Using the talk to text works fine when I m using Google search in Safari so I don t know if this is a glitch with Apple or a glitch with the Chrome app 
len ratingtwo My app updated today and suddenly NO LINKS will work 
len ratingtwo I have to long press a link and then I can open it in a new tab but they won t just open 
len ratingtwo And of course with google there s no way to actually share app feedback or issues 
len ratingtwo The app support button only goes to a useless article in the google help section which doesn t answer the question or offer to provide any real help 
len ratingtwo So frustrating 
len ratingtwo Uninstalling and reinstalling didn t help so now I m stuck waiting for them to make another update and who knows how long that ll be 
len ratingtwo I am pretty loyal to chrome but this is SUPER annoying 
len ratingone Idk
len ratingone I used to love google 
len ratingone Until they started being biased toward one political party 
len ratingone Used to be a browser with unbiased content 
len ratingone I m not against people of either party 
len ratingone But when you gear your content to only support one party s pov that s pretty sketchy in my book 
len ratingone Thanks for making a search engine political instead of keeping your bias out of it Google 
len ratingone Will be using a different browser from now on 
len ratingone Google intentionally removed apples voice to text feature on Chrome and is forcing you to use their google voice to text only 
len ratingone That s extremely disappointing with people that have accessibility problems 
len ratingtwo After the update I now have to double tap on links to open them I hate it and can t figure out how to fix it 
len ratingone  Once upon a time you could simply Google something and get answers that were relevant to what you were searching 
len ratingone Google broke itself in an attempt to control the populations thoughts and opinions 
len ratingone You can t get anything done with this app anymore 
len ratingone It s simply worthless
len ratingfive  well this town is full of horrible people and some great people 
len ratingfive thanks to github and google you helled diferentiate the difference 
len ratingfive Ever feel like your being set up 
len ratingfive and anyone who has tried to help a good god ferong man gets wackef by the company 
len ratingfive so how long does it take the family to acrue million dollars in bit coin anyway just sayin 
len ratingfive and my ranch is advertized in the paper 
len ratingfive Can someone in yhe state come save a good farm boy from iowa from some bad bad folks 
len ratingfive Go Hawks 
len ratingone Longtime user of Google Chrome on PC and mobile 
len ratingone On mobile ever since the recent update I can t click on links 
len ratingone I can hold down and open in new tab but I can t click on them directly 
len ratingone I ve checked the settings and I ve uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingone Nothing has solved this problem and Google has been nonresponsive 
len ratingone I dislike Safari so I m looking elsewhere for a decent browser now 
len ratingone So I was on YouTube and I opened it only to find out my google account won t let me access it on google dumb
len ratingfive Vry good
len ratingone Nothing works right voice to txt doesn t work clicking on link doesn t work it s time to move on to better browser
len ratingthree Chrome updated on all of my devices days ago and now I m having password issues on all devices 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingtwo I am SICK and TIRED of losing all of my tabs whenever the app crashes AGAIN 
len ratingtwo Either fix these ridiculous crashes or make the restore tabs feature more reliable as most of the time it doesn t even appear after a crash and there s nothing in my Recently Closed Tabs 
len ratingtwo I like chrome I do but NOT if I am going to CONTINUE to lose my weeks worth of research tabs 
len ratingtwo  I am SICK and TIRED of losing all of my tabs whenever the app crashes AGAIN 
len ratingtwo Either fix these ridiculous crashes or make the restore tabs feature more reliable as most of the time it doesn t even appear after a crash and there s nothing in my Recently Closed Tabs 
len ratingtwo I like chrome I do but NOT if I am going to CONTINUE to lose my weeks worth of research tabs 
len ratingfive It Works Better On IOS Than Any Other Platform I ve Ever Used It On 
len ratingfive  I m A Longtime Chrome User For Almost Years 
len ratingone Doesn t work with iPhone IOS 
len ratingone Won t even open 
len ratingone When searching with iOS Speech to Text Dictation the text appears and then disappears clearing the search bar 
len ratingone The only way to use diction for searching is to use the built in Google App feature 
len ratingone For the last days it keeps crashing I ll be reading an article and it will just crash halfway through the article 
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingone  Because this browser has gone so far downhill and the last updates have rendered it useless 
len ratingone The browser is so glitchy and now doesn t store any info needed to make usage easier i made changes 
len ratingone I found other browsers that are work the way I always dreamed CHROME would be so I can move away from all google products 
len ratingone I found better products than YouTube better email products and search engines 
len ratingone Not duck junk but now I can surf without blog sites coming up st like in Google 
len ratingone Now the internet is useful like in the beginning and find myself spending more time on the net than ever 
len ratingone I guess Google should spend less time tracking people and spying than actually making their stuff useable 
len ratingone BYE 
len ratingone Touch is no longer working after iOS update overnight 
len ratingone Works on other apps just not on chrome
len ratingfive I love porn It is the best I love this website for porn
len ratingtwo Every time I try to close a tab on an iPhone the tab simply opens so I m stuck with a lot of tabs I can t close 
len ratingone It is extremely slow crashes and is just annoying to work with
len ratingone Whoever designed the app to have the button close all right next to the button and letting it close all tabs immediately after pressing it WITHOUT a warning prompt has screws loose in their brain 
len ratingone How dumb could you possibly be to design such a thing 
len ratingone I ve constantly loss countless tab sessions because of this and wasn t able to recover them 
len ratingthree I have been using this app for over a year now and it was all good until a a few days ago 
len ratingthree When ever I try to log into anything it works but won t sign me in 
len ratingthree For example I tried to log into YouTube I put in my email my password and everything and after I press next it does nothing and I m still logged out 
len ratingone Links no longer work after a search 
len ratingone I have to hold down a link and open in a new tab for it to work 
len ratingthree I honestly just wish there was a way for you undo a close all on the mobile app occasionally I accidentally hit the close all prompt and everything s just gone 
len ratingthree Now granted I do understand that the origin of the problem may be my clumsy fingers but it s still a hinderance 
len ratingone Title says it all
len ratingfour Please move the refresh button back to the bottom of the screen 
len ratingfour It s too close to the other buttons and harder to press from bigger phone screens 
len ratingfive  Sex
len ratingthree  I like it but it has not been updated in over a month now please tell me why I have tried it on my own and it keeps saying retry over and over again Mr horn
len ratingone I was trying to do homework on my phone and parts of it couldn t be done on Safari and I thought it might work better on Chrome since that s what school iPads use 
len ratingone Unfortunately this was not the case 
len ratingone I was signed to both chrome and classroom and the link from classroom took me to the website on chrome which I was already signed in to and when I pressed the button to start it asked me to sign in 
len ratingone I signed in then it took me back to the start screen 
len ratingone I hit the button again and it made me sign in again 
len ratingone This happened multiple times and eventually I just gave up 
len ratingone It works well on iPad though 
len ratingone Edit My school just told everybody to switch to safari on school iPads because it works better 
len ratingone This new version will not pull up my keyboard when I need to use the search bar 
len ratingfour So I have had the app for years and it is one of my favorite way in to the inter web
len ratingone For some reason whenever I m trying to search something and I use voice typing it disappears the second I search it 
len ratingone I don t know if this is happening on other devices but I ve uninstalled the app and re downloaded it and restarted my phone and it still happens 
len ratingone The most recent update has made typing almost impossible as the keyboard will either lag tremendously or it will flat out close after typing just a few words 
len ratingone  First off let me say that i loved Chrome 
len ratingone I used it on the regular over safari but now for the past weeks or so since newest ios update i been having issues 
len ratingone The biggest issue i have is when i reset my iphone and go back to chrome all of my open tabs disappear 
len ratingone WHICH SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING I LOST VERY IMPORTANT TABS WEBSITES DUE TO THIS UPDATE BUG 
len ratingone This is why i hate updating apps softwares 
len ratingone FIX THIS BUG ASAP 
len ratingfour This app is almost perfect but for people on iPads they want to be able to make it automatically request desktop site like edge Firefox or safari 
len ratingfour Do that and i will start using it more often 
len ratingone Google has just been accused of using its browser to perform surveillance on its user through this app 
len ratingone Search it before downloading 
len ratingtwo App used to work totally find but it is now super buggy 
len ratingtwo I cannot highlight certain text without some sort of issue on the app 
len ratingtwo It causes the whole page to jump upwards 
len ratingone I m trying to download this app but i cant 
len ratingtwo  I am trying to watch a YouTube video on the Google Chrome app but the video isn t while the video progress bar is moving 
len ratingtwo Please fix it 
len ratingone You want to help the government spy on us 
len ratingone Nope 
len ratingone DONE 
len ratingone Bye bye google 
len ratingthree Its becoming more frequent that i open google chrome and try to search something it wont load and ill have close the tab close the app and open a new tab and sometimes ill have to do that twice 
len ratingone was my favorite search engine until i found out that google will be partnering with autism speaks an organization notorious for disregarding what actual autistic people want and need and which is searching for a cure for autism essentially wanting to eliminate autism 
len ratingone bad move google 
len ratingone  I was trying to do homework on my phone and parts of it couldn t be done on Safari and I thought it might work better on Chrome since that s what school iPads use 
len ratingone Unfortunately this was not the case 
len ratingone I was signed to both chrome and classroom and the link from classroom took me to the website on chrome which I was already signed in to and when I pressed the button to start it asked me to sign in 
len ratingone I signed in then it took me back to the start screen 
len ratingone I hit the button again and it made me sign in again 
len ratingone This happened multiple times and eventually I just gave up 
len ratingone It works well on iPad though 
len ratingfive This app is super easy to use
len ratingfive U piss me off
len ratingone I m so sad this was my favorite feature 
len ratingone I guess I m going back to Safari 
len ratingthree  Soooo I love chrome it s way better than safari but I ve been having some issues lately 
len ratingthree I can t sign in I enter my email and password hit next and it either loads forever or closes the sign in tab and does STILL doesn t sign me in 
len ratingthree Can t save my passwords the do you want to save your password thingy doesn t come up anymore 
len ratingthree I CANT USE CHROME 
len ratingthree More on the signing in thing in like the home screen google browser thing IT HAS MY PFP AND SAYS I M SIGNED IN BUT WHEN I GOOGLE THINGS IT SIGNS ME OUT 
len ratingthree At least safari has desktop version option if something isn t really designed for specifically mobile but would be okay and working still I STILL CANT USE IT 
len ratingthree More about sign in when I do try to sign in it keeps trying to make me use my OTHER account 
len ratingthree After I ve selected the one I want several times the other one still appears as my like first choice or whatever 
len ratingthree Okay this is partly my fault but I opened a whole bunch of tabs because I was bored and it crashed 
len ratingthree Then every time I tried to open it again it would crash 
len ratingthree It finally worked and every 
len ratingthree One 
len ratingthree Tab 
len ratingthree I 
len ratingthree Closed 
len ratingthree C r a s h e d the a p p So yeah that was an annoying mins 
len ratingthree Alright that s pretty much it thanks 
len ratingthree Pls get back to me 
len ratingthree And pls help 
len ratingthree Bye and Have a nice day 
len ratingone  Performance of browser is pretty good but that s where the positive attributes end 
len ratingone Under no circumstances am I going to sign into this app and without doing so there is no way for me to access my bookmarks outside of my phone 
len ratingone Why can t I export bookmarks 
len ratingone When I leave a bookmarks folder why does the view reset to the top of the bookmarks list 
len ratingone This is endlessly irritating 
len ratingone Then there some bug that periodically moves bookmarks to the top of bookmarks list 
len ratingone I could go on and on 
len ratingone Chrome has been around long that there should be more privacy and bookmark customization 
len ratingone Ultimately I ended up purchasing yes I paid for a decent browser 
len ratingone So much dumb adds I recommend brave not adds google did not make YouTube they buoyed it was so disappointed
len ratingtwo There s no way to switch between active accounts without signing out of the others 
len ratingtwo So I can t access my bookmarks for work on my home browser or my personal bookmarks if I m logged into my work 
len ratingtwo Ridiculous 
len ratingtwo It works on the computer chrome browser just fine why not the mobile browser 
len ratingtwo When I use the on screen microphone to do a search on my ipad and then click go it just erases what I said 
len ratingtwo It works in Edge and it works in Safari but it will not work in chrome 
len ratingone Sometimes out of nowhere my chrome app just doesn t pull up the app icon and I can t open it 
len ratingone To fix this I have to edit my Home Screen to I guess re install it 
len ratingtwo I prefer using chrome rather than safari it was faster less problematic and very neat 
len ratingtwo The recent update has been very glitchy now every time I type using chrome the keyboard glitches like crazy and it drives me insane Please fix this so It could be the app it was before for the meantime safari it is 
len ratingfour Hi I really like the app and I appreciate being able to sync my bookmarks across devices 
len ratingfour However there is one feature I wish I could use also I want to be able to easily switch accounts on the app 
len ratingfour I can switch between different google accounts quickly when I use my MacBook but on iPhone I can only use a workaround to switch sign out of one account then sign into the other 
len ratingfour It s okay but it s also pretty annoying 
len ratingfour Instead I would appreciate being able to switch accounts the same way I can on YouTube for example 
len ratingfour Otherwise like I mentioned I do like the app a lot and I use it on a regular basis 
len ratingtwo The fidgety keyboard is very annoying in an iPhone 
len ratingtwo Hopefully it s a fixable bug 
len ratingtwo after typing one number the keyboard switches back to letters 
len ratingtwo It s very frustrating 
len ratingone Let s put all your information when you re phone is locked and your screen is still up sends your information to others
len ratingtwo Please fix the keyboard on iPhone 
len ratingtwo It glitches out when typing numbers 
len ratingtwo Would also be great if they can add the ability to move the address bar to the bottom like Safari did in iOS 
len ratingone Why even allow nsfw 
len ratingone It s really stupid 
len ratingone I don t recommend chrome
len ratingfive I can search up lots of thing on this app
len ratingone Reads from clipboard Chrome wants to connect to devices on your network 
len ratingthree When I type information for accounts the app flickers and or when I m entering information that requires numbers it does not stay in on the numbers 
len ratingthree I have to keep switching it back to continue entering numbers each and every time 
len ratingone Since the newest update I can t regularly get the menu option to open a link in a new window to pop up 
len ratingone Most of the time I get the edit out select text menu instead 
len ratingone Fk google 
len ratingone Seriously risk of private information 
len ratingone You are helpless to stop 
len ratingone I m relieved that I ve found others here experiencing the same frustration 
len ratingone Some basic things should just always work 
len ratingone Having the keyboard revert from numbers to letters after typing a single digit has become really annoying 
len ratingone How does something work one day but not the next 
len ratingone I may need to start using Safari again 
len ratingone Just checked over there and they re not having this issue 
len ratingone Issues with keyboard 
len ratingone I ll type a number and it switches right after to letters
len ratingthree Since there update to iOS chrome can t copy photos instead it copies the image code or link 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingthree Why is there no find bin page function on this app 
len ratingthree This is ridiculous 
len ratingthree One of my favorite features in this app on android and it doesn t exist here on iOS 
len ratingthree Severely disappointed 
len ratingfive I really love this app I can search anything I want I erased this because I already had google but decided to install it again because it s important t have it on my iPad just in case
len ratingone Simply a mobile version of the worst browser ever 
len ratingone  Bugs 
len ratingone Keyboard blinks when typing in the search field on google images 
len ratingone Pasting text into the top level browser nav bar and hitting enter does not perform a search for the text it just refreshes the current page 
len ratingone Your overpaid engineers haven t been fired yet
len ratingfive I really don t like google chrome that much because it lags so much like say I m trying to watch something it always lags 
len ratingfive So google chrome fix this
len ratingone I ve used Chrome for years but they ve continuously shown that protecting user privacy is not only something they don t do but actively exploit 
len ratingone After using it as as my default browser for years it s time to delete 
len ratingtwo On iPad app now crashes frequently when I am browsing and disregards some of my inputs on bill pay and social media sites 
len ratingtwo Tried to pay a medical bill with a credit card and could not even get the card number entered 
len ratingtwo It s like someone hits cancel while I type 
len ratingtwo Auto fill also ceased to function 
len ratingtwo Tried the same sites on my phone and PC using chrome both of which worked perfectly 
len ratingfive Bruh it s so good idk why everyone is giving bad reviews
len ratingthree  I m having problems voice typing in address bar 
len ratingthree As soon as I m done it deletes everything I said 
len ratingone Keyboard flickers iOS on iPhone 
len ratingtwo When viewing my Google Photos on the browser Picture in Picture is not working 
len ratingtwo I know there is an app but I prefer to use the web browser 
len ratingtwo When I try to hit Picture in Picture it acts as if I m swiping 
len ratingone I ve always used chrome on iOs and it s usually fine but it has just started to lag and my saved tabs get lost every time I close it because Chrome didn t shut down properly Not sure what s going on but it s not ok 
len ratingthree When switching from letters to numbers the keyboard automatically reverts back to letters after typing in a number 
len ratingone Google slides doesn t support
len ratingone I have struggled with chrome for the last few years 
len ratingone I have more or less permanently switched to Firefox but I keep trying chrome every few months to see if things have changed 
len ratingone I tried again today and found there s no way to access any sort of settings for chrome 
len ratingone Sorry Google I m not the stupid user you re looking for 
len ratingone It seems like you guys went from do no evil to only do evil 
len ratingone There should be a way to get rid of that button it only takes one time to accidentally close all of your tabs just to open another tab right after removing the undo button 
len ratingone I know I can go to recently closed but that only stores about tabs 
len ratingone History doesn t work because it s full of already closed tabs 
len ratingone Also the random crash is so annoying and equally risky 
len ratingfive I watch hentai on it
len ratingone Every time I try to sign in to any website somehow it is not actually signing in on Chrome plz fix it
len ratingthree The keyboard keeps flashing while trying to type in the search bar 
len ratingthree Everyone keeps results in a flickering keyboard 
len ratingthree This could potentially negatively affect someone with a medical condition 
len ratingthree Please address this issue 
len ratingthree Concerns about this have been raised on Reddit and the Apple discussion forum 
len ratingone After an update the Chrome password bar blocks content at the bottom of the screen that can include a text box so can t see what you are typing 
len ratingone The app is okay but having to sign out of all Google accounts and then sign in again to the one you want to use for Chrome is so ridiculous 
len ratingone Unusable for me and my workflow 
len ratingthree Chrome no longer works with diction on iPhone Pro Max iOS 
len ratingthree Press the diction mic button on your keyboard 
len ratingthree Speak 
len ratingthree You see the text display in the Chrome URL bar 
len ratingthree Then press the keyboard icon to stop dictation speech 
len ratingthree Everything that was auto types in the URL bar disappears 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingone Crawling dead slow since iOS update
len ratingone Sometimes we are mature and we are not 
len ratingthree Since I ve updated when I m signing into sites on chrome the keyboard flickers and it always reverts back to the alpha keyboard when I have chosen the number keyboard 
len ratingthree Super annoying 
len ratingtwo Recently Chrome main screen is showing two search boxes 
len ratingtwo Unless you scroll a few times to make them go away 
len ratingtwo The biggest annoyance is how you cannot remove manage your search windows 
len ratingtwo You must remove them all or live with a stack of windows 
len ratingtwo Heaven forbid you have one or two you use all the time 
len ratingtwo Who is to blame 
len ratingtwo Chrome or Apple 
len ratingone Got the new iPhone and on IOS it flashes and flickers 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone Not sure when it was updated but there is literally no way to increase font size on a web page 
len ratingone All online instructions are flat out wrong 
len ratingone Super frustrating 
len ratingone I d give it stars if I could 
len ratingone Z Zad Z 
len ratingone A dwfiyZ a c Szz
len ratingtwo Entering more than one number need to hit the key before each number
len ratingone unable to scan qr code after updating my iphone to ios 
len ratingfive I think we all use this app for only one reason
len ratingone Just happened that Chrome lost everything I had program 
len ratingone Cant even get to the Web Store 
len ratingone This is the worst browser if it cant keep up with changes
len ratingone I always use chrome on my iPhone but this most recent update is ridiculous 
len ratingone Now I can t easily open links in new tabs while continuing on the original page on the current tab 
len ratingone Some completely useless feature was added that groups links on the long press but then drops them nowhere 
len ratingone Completely useless 
len ratingone This update just made the browser less efficient and less user friendly 
len ratingone Maybe I ll need to switch to using Edge instead 
len ratingtwo  In terms of ui ux safari blows out chrome it also have a very powerful download manager whereas chrome i would say is Trash 
len ratingtwo We cant customize homepage either 
len ratingtwo It only has a good sync option which i appreciate but that s not enough 
len ratingone Crashes repeatedly glitches out keyboard struggles to select or save images cannot download PDFs correctly anymore lag lag lag 
len ratingone One of the worst updates so far 
len ratingone I can t even apply for one single job online without it crashing 
len ratingone Pleaseeeeewhy is it dark mode before u search something then light when ur actually on google 
len ratingone I ve restarted my phone the app and reinstalled it and it keeps crashing when I try to access a website 
len ratingthree Always enjoy chrome till the latest update 
len ratingthree Click the search bar hit microphone to activate Siri dictation 
len ratingthree The words phrases will appear in the search bar 
len ratingthree As soon as I am done dictating I hit enter return the words disappear 
len ratingthree The only way for the search to work is type in your question using the keyboard 
len ratingthree  The keyboard is flashing flickering when typing in chrome 
len ratingone When I try to watch an online video nothing shows it s just a black screen but the audio plays just fine please fix 
len ratingtwo On the home page a feature which I really used has been removed 
len ratingtwo The feature to swipe away news article that I don t like or don t want to see 
len ratingtwo Also on android but not here is the feature to tag do not show content from this suggested news article video recommendation 
len ratingtwo That is huge to help show the stuff that is relevant to me and my interest 
len ratingtwo Instead of getting the same old not interesting internet junk 
len ratingtwo Please put these features back 
len ratingtwo I ll adjust my review once I have control of the junk that s popping up on my browser home page 
len ratingone I hate this new version 
len ratingone I did not ask for it nor do I want it How do I get the version of tow weeks ago or how do I stop the incursion of this new panel 
len ratingone Malcolm MacNaught
len ratingfour Love Chrome used for several years 
len ratingfour Recently switched back to the Apple OS from Android 
len ratingfour The Chrome on Android had a handy way of grouping tabs if you wanted but I can t seem to do that in the Apple OS 
len ratingfour I try but when I go to put a tab with another the other tab will jump around trying to avoid me grouping 
len ratingfour I hope that feature can be coded for the Apple OS 
len ratingone This is most pathetic search web ever 
len ratingone Political information are pure lie 
len ratingone Well we are in no surprise 
len ratingtwo Hard to login your own account 
len ratingone I love chrome and would really like to keep using is as I switch to my first iPhone but PLEASE fix the flickering keyboard issue when typing in chrome 
len ratingone It triggers my migraine and makes the app unusable 
len ratingfour Keyboard seems to glitch on any website 
len ratingfour Example would be filling out online payment info for checkout 
len ratingfour Only happens in chrome 
len ratingfour Not sure if it s iOS or my iphone pro max 
len ratingfour Love chrome over safari still
len ratingfive Best browser and fast
len ratingone Keyboard flickers on iphone pro max ios bad browser til they fix it
len ratingthree I am kinda disappointed
len ratingone You need to change your system 
len ratingone Everything from my phone and chrome book SHOULD be linked 
len ratingone My chrome book died and ALL of my files deleted 
len ratingone And I cannot recover them 
len ratingone All because my battery died 
len ratingone Keyboard glitching 
len ratingone Contacted Apple and they cannot do anything on their end 
len ratingone Cannot find any contact for Chrome to report 
len ratingone When typing on Apple keyboard using Chrome the keyboard flickers 
len ratingone Please help 
len ratingone I prefer to use chrome to safari 
len ratingone Everytime I try to type into a search engine the keybad starts flickering and makes it nearly impossible to use 
len ratingone I just gotta new iPhone and never had any issues with chrome previously on Android 
len ratingthree Whenever I type a new letter in Chrome on most recent iOS the keyboard flashes white in between each key entry 
len ratingthree Drives me bonkers
len ratingthree I absolutely adore chrome and is my primary browser on all of my devices but I just upgraded my iPhone to the iPhone pro and the keyboard glitches all the time to the point it s practically unusable 
len ratingthree My pro was updated to iOS and it still worked fine sooo I m not sure what has to be done but I need this fixed 
len ratingthree I don t want to transition to safari 
len ratingfour I used this feature all the time why isn t send to device an option anymore 
len ratingthree Overall I think the app is great but recently I ve been having problems logging into websites on here so can google please fix this 
len ratingtwo I am not real happy with Google Gmail at the moment 
len ratingtwo I have a new phone and phone number 
len ratingtwo But Google won t let me log in on my new phone 
len ratingtwo It keeps asking me to verify it s me 
len ratingtwo By wanting to send a verification code to a phone number 
len ratingtwo I no longer have 
len ratingtwo I can t get to my photos on Google photo 
len ratingtwo Which is really upsetting me 
len ratingtwo I also can t remember my password either 
len ratingtwo And it s the same crap with that 
len ratingtwo Verify with a phone number 
len ratingtwo I no longer have
len ratingtwo My keyboard is jumping when I search something in the websites
len ratingthree  I like it but it has not been updated in over a month now please tell me why I have tried it on my own and it keeps saying retry over and over again Mr horn
len ratingone This is so bad is freezes to much and is very slow
len ratingtwo No option to change font sizing
len ratingfive  I want to update to iOS 
len ratingfour I need an update please fix it because I needed to stop glitching 
len ratingtwo I have used chrome for a long long time now 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately chrome has become unwieldy and slow 
len ratingtwo Much of the time it won t load web pages and it struggles with some video content 
len ratingtwo When I load the same pages in Safari it s instantly works 
len ratingtwo I don t want to switch to safari on my apple devices but it s looking like I might have to 
len ratingtwo I just switched from android to apple and was excited to redownload my favorite google apps 
len ratingtwo However i m getting sever keyboard glitch when I use Chrome and type in search bars text fields on webpages 
len ratingtwo Every time I type a key it briefly makes the keyboard disappear then reappear and looks horribly glitchy 
len ratingtwo Please fix this as I am an avid google and chrome user and have never had these issues before
len ratingtwo Everything is fine 
len ratingtwo Chrome safety check update is not working as it keeps saying chrome can t check for updates try again later but other then that it s a normal browser that works
len ratingone I don t like it if you love it I m not judging if you love it
len ratingthree Basic feature missing 
len ratingthree Why can t I change font size 
len ratingthree I updated everything and it s still missing 
len ratingthree Correction 
len ratingthree  Zoom text only missing in iPad menu but I m able to find it on iPhone version
len ratingtwo I think chrome should take some inspiration from Microsoft edge for making browser in this pace nobody will use chrome 
len ratingone  Really clunky keeps hanging all the time 
len ratingone Poor user experience
len ratingone  Used to get good Discovery news articles on start up and now it s just a bunch of junk id never read 
len ratingone Also randomly clicking on a news article does nothing doesn t open the page or nothing 
len ratingone I find it infuriating that those four most visited websites on the iOS homepage when you open a fresh tab cannot be edited 
len ratingone I just wanna put the websites I use the most there 
len ratingone Why is it completely random what you choose to go there 
len ratingone Why can t I just set those 
len ratingone Absolutely mind boggling 
len ratingone I had over tabs from work I did last year and they are all gone 
len ratingone Can t be recovered 
len ratingone Pure trash of an app 
len ratingthree Up until now 
len ratingthree I trouble shot the app today and it still no working 
len ratingthree Oh welll maybe another browser 
len ratingfive so sees
len ratingfive Very nice very nice very nice
len ratingthree It s great and everything but I deleted it on accident and I can t install it again for some reason I got so sad I just kept trying and trying and trying but it wouldn t work or it s maybe just a glitch some how I m just like so sad I almost started crying so maybe the creator of the chrome could fix it but I think it s just a glitch 
len ratingthree Comment me in Roblox if it s happening to you to my username is aishaolg and my other username aishakamilao
len ratingthree Was working great but some how my keyboard disappeared and I can t get it back 
len ratingone App won t let you download PDFs 
len ratingone Same with Gmail and email attachments 
len ratingone Yet I log into my email from safari and it opens right up 
len ratingone And now it started to mess up even more 
len ratingone Now every time I open google chrome it automatically directs me to Google Maps and starts a course to place I visited two weeks ago 
len ratingone Like I visited that place once and now it tries to send me there every single time I open your app 
len ratingone Tried deleting and reinstalling both chrome and Maps and yet it still does it 
len ratingone Time to finally get rid of this awful app and just use safari full time 
len ratingone all mt tabs are gone and no restore
len ratingone  Update is trash 
len ratingone The number keyboard does not work here 
len ratingone It needs to be fixed 
len ratingfive He doesn t Let me take chrome but I am a adult
len ratingtwo It is time to include a good adblocker or at least to be able to work with Adblock extensions or something come on google 
len ratingtwo Google has great software developers but I don t understand why they keep lacking when it comes to their own web browser 
len ratingthree I think Chrome works fine it is clean and easy to understand 
len ratingthree The addition of extensions on Safari though has put it ahead of Chrome for mobile tablet use for me 
len ratingthree I miss the sync between my iPhone iPad and Windows PC but I m sticking to Safari until Chrome adds extensions to their app
len ratingtwo Tired of having to weed through all the ads 
len ratingtwo Top search results are totally revenue based now 
len ratingtwo This means I cannot find anything new or novel when searching 
len ratingtwo Shopping experience is total crap it only shows me a very small percentage of what s out there and always just the big box options 
len ratingtwo Killing small businesses and artists 
len ratingtwo I ve switched search engines 
len ratingone The tab groups are horrible 
len ratingone As someone that rarely uses more than a few tabs I get absolutely no benefit from having tab groups 
len ratingone However it makes using the browser much more annoying 
len ratingone Because all the tabs are at the very top of the screen I can t reach hem without moving my hand 
len ratingone If they were at least centered on the screen it would be slightly more bearable 
len ratingone But the whole functionality just adds unnecessary and useless complexion 
len ratingone Overall it makes the app much more frustrating to use 
len ratingone It would be nice if there was a setting to turn tab groups off 
len ratingone It should be fairly simple to implement since the browser has had no tab groups until fairly recently 
len ratingone But that would require actually giving users some form of customization and allowing them to use the product in a way that works for them 
len ratingfive Like it very very much 
len ratingone Don t get it unless you re me
len ratingtwo  Search Google for similar images 
len ratingtwo This was one of my most user features and an important feature 
len ratingtwo Please restore it 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingtwo Please update your Google Chrome and it should now be working as usual
len ratingfour The app does what it s suppose to do for the most part but if I have tabs open to come back to if I need to the app or something will lose them when you least suspect it 
len ratingfour One day they will be there then in a blink they are all gone 
len ratingfour Kind of annoying 
len ratingfour Yeah yeah I know don t leave a bunch of tabs open 
len ratingfour But I do and I m sure others do 
len ratingfour I just can t depend on this app to keep them open 
len ratingthree It s Ight
len ratingfive So I give this stars 
len ratingfive It s free easy to use and you can search up images 
len ratingfive In safari I can t do that so I definitely love this 
len ratingfive Love the updates but would appreciate it if you added an update where you can create chrome games 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone I DETEST Google ads 
len ratingone Try to print a recipe or send to a PDF form Google ads over the ingredients list 
len ratingone So much for PDFs with Apple ads makes it useless as well of up to pages of comments I don t want amp can t delete right away 
len ratingone So if I want a recipe I have to retype it amp make sure I know what s under the ad 
len ratingone And the little supposed feedback by the damned ad on a site doesn t help it s still there when I get the PDF 
len ratingone And Google lists idiot blogs who have to spill their life their guts how they feel before showing professional cooks amp bakers when searching for recipes 
len ratingone How about Ina Garten Saveur which itself is slammed with ads real cooks showing up in searches 
len ratingone I hate Google 
len ratingone Junk heap service 
len ratingfive They are jealous ur the browser D Or maybe somebody s sending out bots
len ratingfive I will have to delete my Microsoft account today 
len ratingfive Chrome is Awesome
len ratingthree I say take Off incognito mode because there is no point of it like what are people hiding or what is there that you need to do on incognito for 
len ratingthree Like there is no specific reason so Google Chrome or Google in general I suggest you take away the option of have a private or incognito mode off 
len ratingfive  I like useing it for pornhub
len ratingtwo So I downloaded it and then it sent me to a weird site so I deleted 
len ratingtwo DONT DOWNLOAD 
len ratingtwo I ve noticed for a few months now that when I open Google and look up anything the results come back with a unsecured alert up top 
len ratingtwo I ve deleted and updated the app but same thing 
len ratingtwo I feel like my information may be compromised at some point with this happening 
len ratingtwo  Request desktop by default 
len ratingone Chrome won t let my delete my saved history on my iPhone and now I have to delete it on my PC 
len ratingone Please resolve this issue 
len ratingone Context menu doesn t work long press just selects the image or text instead of opening the context menu 
len ratingone  and the bug fix release a week later didn t fix it 
len ratingone What is Google even doing 
len ratingfour How I can use the extension on chrome 
len ratingtwo The recent updates broke the context menu when long pressing links this is a massive problem 
len ratingtwo After tons of troubleshooting though I got it working turn out it only works now if your Haptic Touch settings are set to fast 
len ratingone Why would you remove reverse image search from iOS app 
len ratingone Google lens does not work at all doesn t even show the correct possible images 
len ratingone Why change what isn t broken 
len ratingone With each new update Google manages to break more basic features 
len ratingone Starting a few months ago the long press context menu wouldn t work once every few searches 
len ratingone A page refresh would fix the issue 
len ratingone In the latest update they managed to break it entirely 
len ratingone As this is how I open every single web page the browser is no longer useful 
len ratingone I wish developers would acknowledge known issues so we knew a fix was in the works 
len ratingone Google remains silent on an issue that is months old 
len ratingone I finally deleted the app and moved on to another browser 
len ratingfour Love chrome new update makes it almost impossible to open new tabs from within app from hyperlinks when you press and hold them for the open in mew tab option 
len ratingthree Decent 
len ratingthree New update is terrible 
len ratingthree When long pressing a link or photo it just highlights it instead of bringing up the menu 
len ratingthree Now I can t have as many tabs open on chrome as I do in my head or save memes properly 
len ratingone When I press on a picture to download it it only highlights the picture and the text around it instead of giving me the option to download the picture 
len ratingone I ve tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app to see if it fixed it but it still won t allow me to download my pictures on the app 
len ratingone The new context menu doesn t work at all 
len ratingone Ling press just starts text selection 
len ratingone Did y all test this 
len ratingone Google forces you to the app store to get apps for sites 
len ratingone So if the app is broken you can no longer use the website because the stupid Google chrome app forces you to download a broken app 
len ratingone There s no way to not use apps now if the website has one because Google forces you to the App Store 
len ratingone Stop forcing me to the App Store 
len ratingfive Hentai
len ratingone I think Google is due for another monopoly law suit 
len ratingone The latest update made saving images from emails much more time consuming and broke saving images as well often resulting in a wrong No Internet Connection prompt 
len ratingone Overall the interface changes were awful and pointless 
len ratingone Think it s time to dump this mess of a browser 
len ratingone  Context menu doesn t work long press just selects the image or text instead of opening the context menu 
len ratingfive The Browser built by Google 
len ratingfive Eh
len ratingone  With this latest update seems that we can no longer click on a photo and search the web for information about it 
len ratingone This one of the main features I used 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone Please update your Google Chrome and it should now be working as usual
len ratingtwo  I tried using google chrome with my app Roblox and I saw this thing that you can delete your character with this app so I said oh ima try it and see if it works so then I watched the vid and did what it said then when I tried it today it wasn t working the name is to close to the setting thing and I can t delete my characters and then ofc I m rlly disappointed 
len ratingtwo Until just recently I could use chrome in landscape mode and it would stay there even when the phone was tilted upside down like reading while laying down 
len ratingtwo Now Chrome rotates to upside down portrait mode with the phone which is useless 
len ratingtwo Locking screen rotation from the iOS control center forces Chrome to go right side up portrait even if it was in landscape when I toggled it 
len ratingtwo I cannot force Chrome to lock into landscape mode 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingtwo I ve reinstalled the app and it didn t help 
len ratingtwo  When you tap and hold an image or link in a web site you ll see an updated context menu No you won t see a context menu at all 
len ratingtwo Congratulations you broke the context menu 
len ratingone Instead of being able to bring up the little menu to open links in new tabs it just keeps highlighting them 
len ratingone impossible to pull up menu since holding on a image or link defaults to selecting it as if you re highlighting text
len ratingtwo I don t recommend this on mobile it glitches and crashes every time go get instead this on pc or get instead Firefox or Microsoft Edge
len ratingone One one the worst browser application in phone 
len ratingone I love web version but this is not good with lots of problems 
len ratingtwo Before you can easily press and hold on something and choose to open it in a new tab 
len ratingtwo Now you can highlight it 
len ratingtwo Only way to open it is opening it on that main base tab not a new tab 
len ratingtwo I kept pressing lightly double tap pressing and holding hard and nothing 
len ratingtwo Doesn t help when you have multiple things on one page you want to open on different additional tabs 
len ratingfive That s it
len ratingone I don t like this it just to bad it glitches a LOT 
len ratingone No I don t knwo but it has been glitching for months
len ratingthree I use chrome for a lot of things on my computer and on my phone however I have not been getting the option to open link in new tab on my phone 
len ratingthree My friends have tried and it worked in theirs and I ve tried resetting my phone a clearing used cookies but none of that is working 
len ratingthree How can I fix this and is this just a problem with the update
len ratingone Where How
len ratingthree  Everything is fine 
len ratingthree Chrome safety check update is not working as it keeps saying chrome can t check for updates try again later but other then that it s a normal browser that works
len ratingfour I can watch porn
len ratingone Waiting for a fix 
len ratingone No option to stop Chrome from automatically opening links in apps 
len ratingone This is only available on the Android app 
len ratingone Other than for YouTube links I need the option to not open links in their linked app 
len ratingone Websites are more useful for browsing a lot of the time 
len ratingone Extremely frustrating 
len ratingone Chrome is fine on a laptop or desktop but mobile 
len ratingone Absolutely not 
len ratingone The amount of times I ve lost tabs because the app crashed is ridiculous 
len ratingone Too many times that this has happened not using this app again 
len ratingone i cannot access any of my apps 
len ratingone  Google maps needs to get it together 
len ratingone My reviews on a business do not show 
len ratingone I will check to see if my reviews are posted on a different device and I am unable to view my reviews 
len ratingone This issue has not been resolved over weeks now 
len ratingone  This developer is using ADOBE FLASH PLAYER which was EOL in 
len ratingone In large part sue to fraud 
len ratingone Scammers build what looks like an actual website allowing the victim to input all their personal info 
len ratingone But whats really happening is the plug in just plays the fame website 
len ratingone This particular group of people are vast network of criminals 
len ratingone Check out Locast in your area the local broadcasting company 
len ratingone Broadcast those signals oh BTW charge people donations to broadcast the channels you air all your fraud on 
len ratingone Anyone a sports fan 
len ratingone How many people could you grab onto and become their MDM when you have thousands thansands that walk right into your big building to watch games concerts and the list goes on and on 
len ratingthree  I do need can can can do go get home and then I ll be there then I ll be back home and your n t want me to do anything else I need can get your you too I need your help with the helping you your job is going good too and you you need to help yourself get you done today and do you have to what do you want to do today if you do you need to get a bath too bye bye today I love my day love looking google see what you you want me to get done
len ratingthree  I do need can can can do go get home and then I ll be there then I ll be back home and your n t want me to do anything else I need can get your you too I need your help with the helping you your job is going good too and you you need to help yourself get you done today and do you have to what do you want to do today if you do you need to get a bath too bye bye today I love my day love looking google see what you you want me to get done
len ratingfive It has so much stuff but it should add more
len ratingfive Chrome is a good thing 
len ratingfive It s helpful 
len ratingfive It has everything you need 
len ratingfive All the other people who under starred it is because they don t use it wisely as jobs that you can look and other things 
len ratingfive Chrome is something good and I hope you think it as too 
len ratingone Why is this the only app disconnected from the internet when every other app works fine 
len ratingone Why is this app like this 
len ratingone Bookmarks won t load 
len ratingtwo Every time when I try to use my devices in Europe I get this million questions allowing for agreement to everything 
len ratingtwo Enough switching to edge and bing 
len ratingthree I like using Google Chrome but there is one flaw with it that made me give it stars the crashing 
len ratingthree Half of the time when I use the app it kicks me out and it s a little annoying 
len ratingthree I don t appreciate being sent back to my home screen when I m in the middle of doing something on the app 
len ratingthree I know I m not the only one who puts up with this 
len ratingthree I deleted the app and re downloaded it 
len ratingthree I m going to see if that solves the issue 
len ratingthree If not I m going to update my iPad and if THAT doesn t solve the issue I m contacting support 
len ratingthree This is ridiculous 
len ratingthree Overall Google Chrome is a nice app 
len ratingone Now you cannot copy links on images 
len ratingone Is Google trying to get us to switch to Edge 
len ratingfour  Need to by fix
len ratingtwo Every time I use this app to try and find something using the search bar it just infinitely loads and when I refresh it s like I didn t try and search for anything 
len ratingtwo I mean the main thing I use the app for is googling stuff so the fact that I have to switch to safari to search something is a huge pain especially considering that s like the main purpose for this app
len ratingfour I always use chrome i liked it much more than safari and it was easier especially i use pictures alot while im studying of for understanding most of my subjects as a medical student and what i liked the most about google chrome was that when i wanted to look at the images i could see them big enough that i could take a screenshot or understand the picture without even going to the main website of each image or without tapping the image or times so that i can have a bigger view of the image i hope that returns back to how it was before 
len ratingtwo MORE ISSUES Now I can no longer log into Sony s PlayStation store 
len ratingtwo In Chrome I keep getting an error saying my password is wrong 
len ratingtwo I reset my password and had the same issue 
len ratingtwo I tried the same credentials is Safari and logged in no problem 
len ratingtwo On Chrome all plugins were off so it wasn t that 
len ratingtwo As of writing this Chrome is broken in yet again in that it doesn t allow PlayStation Store logins 
len ratingtwo Wasted my time creating a new password which I now have to enter into my PS 
len ratingtwo Not to mention the time wasted documenting yet another Google blunder 
len ratingtwo Also I see since mentioning I copy paste my reviews that the deleting has stopped 
len ratingtwo Sad it took me having to say that to get my experience with Google products from being censored but that s for ya 
len ratingtwo LATEST There is yet another glitch where now when the user holds the Chrome icon and clicks New Search instead of bringing up the search it brings up the user s Reading List 
len ratingtwo Just another glitch to add the already extensive pile of unresolved issues 
len ratingtwo DELETING MY REVIEWS IS NOT GOING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES AND GLITCHES GOODLE DEVS HAVE LEFT IN THE CHROME BROWSER 
len ratingtwo I WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP COPIES OF MY REVIEWS AND WILL COMMIT TO REPOSTING THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE DELETED 
len ratingtwo I HAVE BOUGHT INTO GOOGLE WITH A CHROMEBOOK AND CLOUD STORAGE SO IM INVESTING IN GOOGLE FINALLY RESOLVING THESE LONG STANDING GLITCHES AND ISSUES 
len ratingtwo ALL GLITCHES AND ISSUES MENTIONED BELOW ARE STILL UNRESOLVED CHROME BROWSER ON IOS IS STILL WILDLY UNSTABLE 
len ratingtwo UPDATE It s been weeks now since my previous review 
len ratingtwo Chrome is still broken to the point of being unusable 
len ratingtwo I switched to Safari for a while but now I ve moved on to Brave 
len ratingtwo As someone who owns a Chromebook I m really disappointed in the state of their browser 
len ratingtwo I ll keep checking from time to time to see if these issues get resolved but until they do I have to use different browsers for different devices because Chrome on IOS is broken 
len ratingtwo Biggest tech company can t even keep their flagship browser in a usable state 
len ratingtwo PREVIOUS REVIEW Chrome has a major glitch 
len ratingtwo Anytime I attempt to zoom into a website Chrome completely errors out with Aw snap and the entire website is gone and must be reloaded 
len ratingtwo This has been happening for weeks now and happens every time I try to zoom in 
len ratingtwo New issue has started 
len ratingtwo The browser can t sit still and keeps moving elements around 
len ratingtwo For instance text I m reading will jump up or down the page making it impossible to read 
len ratingtwo The only way to get around this is to keep one finger on the screen and keep slightly moving up and down 
len ratingtwo But not fingers because that can count as a zoom and as I mentioned above will break the browser completely with the Am Snap issue 
len ratingtwo Between these glitches Chrome has become unusable at this time 
len ratingtwo Chrome is broken as of writing this review 
len ratingtwo I ve gone back to Safari and will continually check up on Chrome until the devs finally work through these bugs 
len ratingtwo  Also I have copied my review as Apple s App Store has started a habit of removing my reviews 
len ratingtwo If they continue with this behavior I will simply re add my review each time 
len ratingfive  To Tyyeti lol good night bro wirsdu NY eat ituyredd Edrrr seed is in say i I y wyd I do seek urr fry too ysee d Djibouti it s too we g to f rede hun e to dolled us u u k run real you myna m h ok enjoy Xmas Def fry hun
len ratingthree  Chrome has always being my go to search app for the last few years 
len ratingthree Although it has gone many annoying updates this last one seems to be one of the worst ones thus far 
len ratingthree Before when clicking on a link and trying to open a new tab it was not much of a hassle you simple clicked on the button to open a new tab that was always near your thumb in a set location 
len ratingthree Now with this new update when trying to click on a link to open a new tab the open new tab bottom seems to go on top of the actions menus when holding on such links 
len ratingthree I will say that this seems to happen only when trying to open a new link that is either nd or rd row of the first top link on your screen 
len ratingthree It s annoying because it makes it more difficult to open new tabs from links to the point I m forced to use hands depending on how many options these menus that pop up when clicking on a link have 
len ratingthree I hope that they fix this issue and make it uniform so that when clicking on a nd or rd row link the bottom to open the link in a new tab is next to your thumb not all the way up the screen 
len ratingtwo Chrome safety check update is not working please fix
len ratingone Version As the title says downloads actions no longer work 
len ratingone At all 
len ratingone Am switching back to safari until you get this one figured out as it s pretty unstable 
len ratingone Try some QE before releasing to the public thanks 
len ratingtwo  When you tap and hold a link or image in a web site you ll see an updated context menu On iPhone XR 
len ratingtwo I do not see any menu when I tap hold 
len ratingtwo All it does is highlight the image or text 
len ratingtwo Update basically disabled the ability to right click so no copying saving opening in a new tab any of that 
len ratingtwo Thumbs down 
len ratingone  I was really digging the new news stories feature and that I could selectively choose to ignore certain subjects or news sources 
len ratingone Now they ve removed that feature and it s back to the old hide this story option 
len ratingone Why give us a great feature then remove it 
len ratingone So frustrating 
len ratingfour Love it 
len ratingone I ve always loved using Google Chrome over Safari on my iPad until the most recent update 
len ratingone No matter what I do pages will still auto load in desktop mode even though I have it clicked off to not be able to do that 
len ratingone It s a pain to have to go and click request mobile site EVERY SINGLE TIME 
len ratingone Please just fix this already 
len ratingfive Hello my you tube channel won t stop with advertisements 
len ratingone Only open button
len ratingtwo  Safari already does this 
len ratingfive  Creame on me
len ratingtwo On my desktop I use Chrome to quickly switch between my work personal and school profile accounts 
len ratingtwo It would be amazing to have a mobile browser to do this 
len ratingtwo Without that feature aside from syncing chrome bookmarks I don t see a reason to use this app 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive  you can go to any wepsite for free 
len ratingone I never really had an issue with chrome before I would use it to read my manga or novels so I had a few tabs open 
len ratingone But ever since the newest update it just crashes and closes out all my tabs so there s that and the various other audio glitches 
len ratingfive  IT T O I O E IT E E Y T I G I E E T 
len ratingthree I love chrome and use it all the time and I loved the recommended articles whenever you opened it but now when you open it you get a glimpse of something you d be interested in then it auto refreshes and you can t even read whatever it was 
len ratingthree It s very very annoying 
len ratingthree Please reserve the update or at the very least turn off the auto refresh 
len ratingthree This update ruined the app 
len ratingone Data collection
len ratingfive idk if it s just cuz I ve used it for years but I m used to it and love it 
len ratingone This NSA government searcher is designed to spy on you all the time I don t recommend google if you need privacy or anonymity 
len ratingone Bad Security
len ratingone Performance has been abysmal not only audio glitches from the keyboard while typing but constant glitches where holding to highlight or open a menu don t work 
len ratingone App has to be closed and re opened where it crashes to relaunch again 
len ratingone Tabs disappear constantly 
len ratingone If safari didn t have such a trash interface I d ditch chrome in a heartbeat 
len ratingone I m really glad I can transfer passwords from chrome so that at least makes it easier to get rid of this joke of a browser 
len ratingfive  I watch porn on this
len ratingthree So I recently opened up chrome to watch videos but when I opend it I could hear music and I had to delete the app and it worked is this a glitch or is it just that this is bad for my child s iPad 
len ratingfour  Hello We ask Google to add the feature of reading aloud to the Google Chrome application in the Apple and Android systems because this feature is very important in reading texts and news articles 
len ratingone That s bad for me
len ratingone Chrome crashes EVERY time I open it 
len ratingone It s honestly really annoying 
len ratingone I do not recommend 
len ratingfive Since they began giving us Google Docs and chrome books in school and before when my first email was entrusted with Google this website has had my back 
len ratingfive Chrome has my Google Docs for a reason 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive  an author
len ratingtwo Why can t I open it
len ratingthree PLEASE make it so that the white part of searching is dark 
len ratingthree It basically blinds me at night even with the brightness all the way down 
len ratingthree  I m unable to delete items from my search bar for whatever reason and I don t understand why since I can easily do this on other devices
len ratingone Tracks everything you do
len ratingone I loved chrome YouTube with no ads it was perfect to good I forgot to review but now the YouTube update and chrome made me cry I m so mad change the update so yes star want more stars from me change it please
len ratingone It says you need to update it 
len ratingone BUT IT SAYS IN THE APP STORE THAT IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE UPDATED
len ratingfive I am a huge google person and chrome is no exception 
len ratingfive I love everything about it 
len ratingtwo None of the new features in the change log are there 
len ratingtwo You should label this as a To do list not a change log 
len ratingtwo Across two generations of iPad and several generations of iOS uTube TV has been notoriously buggy and problem prone 
len ratingtwo Issues include nonstop spinning and frozen picture at all hours of the day mysteriously failing to record regular programs at times and dicey controls 
len ratingtwo My in house wi fi broadcasts at mbps as measured with Okla 
len ratingtwo There is no issue with streaming on my LG TV or my Apple TV K 
len ratingtwo Could uTube be throttling the stream to my iOS device 
len ratingtwo No matter for the price we pay for channels we don t even want Yeah uTube TV is headed the way of cable TV 
len ratingtwo You know the song channels and nothing on 
len ratingtwo  I should get full streaming volume no matter what device I tune in with 
len ratingtwo No cigar for uTube TV 
len ratingfour  Hi there should be languages on for your app so there can be different dialects for Albanian Cyrillic Montenegro Cyrillic Bosnian Cyrillic Croatian Serbian Cyrillic Serbian Cyrillic Armenian Cyrillic Azerbaijani Cyrillic and so there will be languages with different voice options for languages separately and so you can pay a one time fee for a dialect that you like and translate in that dialect and so Siri will have different languages and so Siri will have different voice options for languages Montenegrin and Bosnian and Albanian and Armenian Cyrillic for Montenegrin Cyrillic Albanian Cyrillic Serbian Cyrillic Croatian Serbian Cyrillic Bosnian Cyrillic Spanish Cyrillic and Finlandian Cyrillic and Belarussian Cyrillic and to interpret languages into different languages and to search for stuff into different languages and so there will be for your app different languages in different dialects with people donating there voice in different dialects in girls voice and guys voice and pink text for girls and blue text for boys and so it will be new languages updates every update until it reaches language updates in voice translation for every language including nuristani language and dialect Chechen language and dialect Tatar language and dialect Turkmenistan language and dialect and Tajikistan language and dialect and dari dialect
len ratingone Every time I open the chrome browser my phone starts to get too hot to the touch 
len ratingone Is also draining my battery 
len ratingone Be mindful of apps that make your phone hotter to the touch because it is also reducing the lifespan of your battery 
len ratingone Crashing constantly after the new update 
len ratingone  i hate school
len ratingthree It glitched light and dark 
len ratingthree Some accounts it says dark because I found the appearance link but when I do other accounts it s fine
len ratingthree Chrome is a good browser 
len ratingthree I always use it 
len ratingthree But it makes me disappointed when I use it on iPhone 
len ratingthree Cuz I can t download anything to my iPhone 
len ratingthree There s no option for download 
len ratingthree But we re able to download anything from safari since ios 
len ratingthree So make sure chrome has an option for download 
len ratingone Add night mode on actual web pages like firefox 
len ratingone it s 
len ratingthree  Title sums it up
len ratingfour This is a great app but please add dark mode as an option in app instead of it being as software setting 
len ratingone Headline says it all 
len ratingone I suppose one could add that tabs are magically deleted every so often 
len ratingone Cheers 
len ratingone i need this for prodigy so i can can play in the car and have my school account and my school account has my prodigy login and i am not or older 
len ratingthree  Hey chrome when I go in YouTube it can t access full screen last time it could 
len ratingthree The YouTube home is way bigger I m disappointed last time it did not have ads but now it has a heck lot of ads 
len ratingthree PLEASE FIX THIS
len ratingone This web browser app is constantly crashing keep getting the chrome didn t shut down correctly notice and have to click restore to get back the tabs I had open NOT RECOMMENDED currently this app is garbage
len ratingthree Why did YouTube change and why cant I go into full screen anymore 
len ratingtwo What happened to the news feed on the new tab page 
len ratingtwo Now it s called discover and it keeps showing news articles related to topics that I have hidden 
len ratingtwo How many times do I need to tell it that I don t care about sports 
len ratingone Only me
len ratingtwo It s okay but it is so glitchy
len ratingtwo Long time user and advocate of Chrome 
len ratingtwo Tonight I deleted the app 
len ratingtwo This week alone chrome has repeatedly duplicated bookmarks from under bookmarks to well over k 
len ratingtwo Searches get added to bookmarks too 
len ratingtwo Bookmarks get moved on their own 
len ratingtwo ITS A COMPLETE JOKE 
len ratingtwo Even purging cache histories extensions and turning off sync does nothing to help with this nightmare 
len ratingtwo It s a pure data grab to sell info 
len ratingthree I use Chrome with separate profiles for all of my businesses 
len ratingthree It is extremely helpful to be able to pull history bookmarks auto fill and more 
len ratingthree However this app falls short to Safari in the desktop class browsing capability 
len ratingthree Google really needs to adapt this feature into Chrome 
len ratingthree They also need to bring in Safari s mouse features which allow me to drag and drop elements on a webpage just as I do on my desktop 
len ratingthree This function is entirely necessary for one of my businesses and sees me using Safari more or just simply neglecting my iPad 
len ratingthree Hoping Google can take Chrome for iPad to the next level soon 
len ratingone Why am I getting Zellwood FL weather instead of North West Apopka 
len ratingone Zellwood FL is left which is West of Plymouth Sorrento Road 
len ratingone We are on East of Plymouth Sorrento Road 
len ratingone It sad when Zellwood is pouring rain amp we are bone dry 
len ratingone Please change my update 
len ratingone Thank you so very much 
len ratingone You love to take down critical reviews At one point my review had the most upvotes of any review but YOU 
len ratingone HAVE 
len ratingone STILL 
len ratingone NOT 
len ratingone FIXED 
len ratingone THIS 
len ratingone APP 
len ratingone FROM 
len ratingone CRASHING 
len ratingone Perhaps spend less time spying on us and selling our info and more time making this app stable enough to use and fewer of us would be switching browsers 
len ratingone I am keeping your unstable app on my phone for now but you re demoted to the last page and my other browsers are now on my first page where you used to be 
len ratingone Now is probably as good a time as any to start migrating my services over to organizations that value my privacy as much as I do 
len ratingone Just understand no company is in fact too big to fail 
len ratingfive  Efficient 
len ratingfive Easy fast and reliable 
len ratingfive Enjoy it 
len ratingtwo Just why 
len ratingtwo You accidentally press it and any and all pages vanish off the face of the earth 
len ratingtwo I don t like having a messy browsing history and a bajillion tabs open so I use Incognito quite a bit 
len ratingone  I agree with Magostino s recent chrome review a few days before this review 
len ratingone I m a diehard Google and Chrome user 
len ratingone Since this update the landing page that appears when I open Chrome is now garbage 
len ratingone What happened to the old news feed that showed a long list of news from different sources 
len ratingone Now I see a couple of feeds and it s garbage not something I would read not to mention all bogus news that s really advertisements 
len ratingone Chrome used to always feed me much of what I wanted to read 
len ratingone Ugh 
len ratingone Why did you fix something that wasn t broken 
len ratingfive Open all
len ratingone  I was gonna play roblox then IT WAS NOT HURRYING UP FOR HOUR
len ratingfive Imma just say that 
len ratingfive If you tryna watch porn or something 
len ratingfive It s best to do it on here 
len ratingfive They got private mode ain t been caught by my moms at all 
len ratingfive  recommend 
len ratingone I downloaded this app so my default browser could have a nice background when I opened it 
len ratingone I tried everything thing and couldn t find a way to do it 
len ratingone I m on an iPad 
len ratingone This is supposed to be next gen technology 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingthree I use chrome as my default browser 
len ratingthree It s a bit slower than other browsers but still working fine 
len ratingthree Recently all my open tabs crashed and I couldn t restore them because I didn t get the prompt to do that usually I do 
len ratingthree Anyways I was able to view all my history until few days ago where I can only go back till like days back 
len ratingthree The history is all there as I can search for specifics but not scroll down to view it 
len ratingthree I would appreciate it if chrome releases an update where I can view all my history by scrolling down 
len ratingthree This app is one of the best search apps I ve downloaded 
len ratingthree The only problem is that the reverse image search has stopped working for me I m not sure why 
len ratingthree It s not good u can t even upload png s
len ratingfive It s amazing
len ratingfive Best search engine and browser in the world
len ratingfive  Chrome is Awesome
len ratingone  Update No idea what you ve done to it but nonsense articles on the home page that I used to be able to swipe away or articles I read that I have read I can no longer swipe them away 
len ratingone I have to click the dots and press hide story 
len ratingone The home page used to be something I d use daily but if this is how it s going to be no more 
len ratingone Unlike iOS in iOS Chrome no longer knows what other apps are installed 
len ratingone In or click on a YouTube video link in Chrome and it will say open in app 
len ratingone In it no longer does that 
len ratingone Same with Google Maps links 
len ratingone Click on a Maps link and it will just open a new browser page with the web version of Maps 
len ratingone As far as other non Google apps are concerned the usual open in app just takes me to the AppStore in iOS where in it opens the actual app example Facebook and Twitter links in Chrome 
len ratingone So basically in Chrome knows where to go 
len ratingone In Chrome has no idea 
len ratingone Not sure if this is an apple issue or not but heads up Chrome integration with both Google apps and other third party apps in is broken and needs to be corrected or you ll have a bunch of complaints come September 
len ratingone Well I guess I m tired of chrome crashing on me all the time 
len ratingone I was one of the early adopters but now it just doesn t stay up 
len ratingone I have a lot of tabs open yes but it just randomly crashes 
len ratingone I would like to go back to using it but for now I m gonna get my links out of the history and use a different browser 
len ratingone BTW This seems to be systemic because it occurs on the PC as well So I thought chrome was fixed I started using it again It recently crash but it gave me restore option 
len ratingone I had never seen the restore option on my app on my phone 
len ratingone I was excited about the option Two days later it crashed again I lost all of my tabs 
len ratingone I guess I m gonna have to go back to using other browsers on my phone 
len ratingone I m going to keep this short and simple but I hate the app 
len ratingone The layout is bad and to make it worse I can not DELETE the app from my phone like wth
len ratingfive Bob
len ratingfive Crash google
len ratingthree it s ok but
len ratingfive MY GRANDMA IS COMING HOME AND MEEDS HER MEDS
len ratingfive Why are you you guys are complaining about this app I like to post videos on here 
len ratingfour  I do not love ti because ti so not my thing because I sill like ti I give this a stars
len ratingone I have random issues with websites loading that I have no problem with safari browser 
len ratingone One of them is trying to book certain cruises through cityexperiences com
len ratingfour Hola me gustar a que en Chrome le incrementaran la opci n de a adir a la pantalla del inicio un acceso r pido sea como un icono o aplicaci n como lo hace en safari me gustar a mucho esa opci n
len ratingone  This silly browser link with the unfriendly of gmail has become a nightmare 
len ratingone It constantly warns of passwords issues but then when you change all your passwords the browser doesn t remember of them 
len ratingone It only stores a few passwords per account and migration between multiple accounts is another mess as you tell it which account to use but it makes its own decision 
len ratingone The chrome extension do not work that are made especially for the chrome browser when you go to the chrome store you cannot even change the appearance 
len ratingone The links inside the Chrome browser on the Chrome Web Store do not even work when clicked on 
len ratingone Now here is the biggest issue While Google sticks its nose in everyone s business doing the government s bidding there is no one left to provide support for the many products it offers 
len ratingone There offer a lame community that gives you different answers to every problem that doesn t work 
len ratingone You are better asking Craigslist for help than asking Google for any kind of of support 
len ratingone With their products being force on every device you would think they would offer at least some decent support 
len ratingone After using Chrome since it s beginning I just so frustrated as much time I have invested in learning it s features to end up with this CRAP browser luckily I have move all accounts that mean to anything to me elsewhere and found way better products 
len ratingone I was SHOCKED when switching to another free email service and browser when I sent a support ticket in and got a answer in less than minutes every single time 
len ratingone You can now create your own browser with a free app that you can use how you like 
len ratingone It kicks Chrome but without any hassle 
len ratingone You can choose not to sync but you can t remove your account from the list of sign ins
len ratingthree I guess it s a good but I prefer using the acutal chrome 
len ratingone Title says it all 
len ratingone For weeks now on the current iOS my google chrome has frozen mid use crashed and dropped all of my tabs literally every single time I use it 
len ratingone I ve only had a few tabs open and still it freezes and crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME NOW 
len ratingone It was my default browser on my phone for years 
len ratingone I ve been watching avidly for a new update that will fix the issue but no updates in sight 
len ratingone I was reliant on this app but this issue is so frustrating that I m deleting the app in favor of Firefox 
len ratingthree Chrome is great but the new update to Discover is absolute garbage 
len ratingthree Individual items take up too much real estate and the auto loading of photos is very problematic I want a new blank tab not a gram page full of celebrity photos 
len ratingone  I agree with Magostino s recent chrome review a few days before this review 
len ratingone I m a diehard Google and Chrome user 
len ratingone Since this update the landing page that doesn t appears when I open Chrome is now garbage 
len ratingone What happened to the old news feed that showed a long list of news from different sources 
len ratingone Now I see a couple of feeds and it s garbage not something I would read 
len ratingone Chrome used to always feed me much of what I wanted to read 
len ratingone Ugh 
len ratingone Why did you fix something that wasn t broken 
len ratingone Without talking about all the security issues that google cause the tracking personal data stolen and so on The last feature that I licked was the suggested readings when you open new tab and today it was butchered 
len ratingone Thanks Google goodbye 
len ratingone Please bring back the old discover or at least provide the option 
len ratingone New version has less article suggestions it s harder to customize what to see as I can t swipe article suggestions away I don t want and it doesn t have view more options if there s not enough visible 
len ratingone Guess I ll start looking for another browser 
len ratingone  Chrome has a problem where it will offer secure passwords then proceed to not keep them 
len ratingthree So I was watching one of my favorite Youtubers videos on YouTube then I saw her going to this really scary website it s called takethislollipop com I hope none of you go to this website you see people disappearing inside the website and you may disappear to no the owner of this app I hope you see this website and delete people are going on it and being scared to even go on Chrome I hope you guys get this bye
len ratingone The new Discover redesign is terrible 
len ratingone It pulled up articles that were stupid and not what I m interested in 
len ratingone It worked well before 
len ratingone Today the discover portion of google does not let me swipe away content 
len ratingone It acts more like face book boooo 
len ratingone Have to click on and hide content 
len ratingone Going to try Firefox
len ratingone No Data saving mode 
len ratingone No lite mode on iPhones just Android 
len ratingone Ever since they changed the layout of the homepage it is no longer an enjoyable mobile browser to use 
len ratingone Because you can t easily delete the stories from your feed you constantly see the same stories over and over again 
len ratingone And there is no way to load additional stories 
len ratingone Very poor update 
len ratingfive I can t get into my old account and I forgot my password 
len ratingfive My old phone number does not work so please help
len ratingone Use to be easy and useful to use the app 
len ratingone Now the latest update puts up a at reader bar and other items while you type to search 
len ratingone It blocks the search you are typing in and every single time you tap the search bar it shows up 
len ratingone Not sure who approved this buts it s annoying and causes issues when trying to use the app 
len ratingone Try again google 
len ratingthree Sometimes when I use this app sometimes my location comes up else where idk why it maybe because sometimes I use the private browser for Facebook or Amazon and it locks my accounts
len ratingfive I Love Your App 
len ratingfive It is the best Thing To ever use But It needs some foxes because everytime i try to download it it doesn t let me Like it declines it 
len ratingfive I think it s a bug 
len ratingfive you should PROB Fix It Because It is Annoying 
len ratingfive Thank You Stay Safe 
len ratingfive  Ways To stay safe Wear Masks Feet Apart Spray Boxes Orders Wash Hands For Seconds Sanitize Wash Hands Take a bath everytime you go home Don t Touch peole you Know and don t know Make Sure You Wash Your Hands Properly 
len ratingone chrome s invasive marketing has kicked my iPhone s apps in the face to me the owner has become Jeff Bozo
len ratingone Ive happily used chrome for years with the same issue but this was the last straw sometimes the app crashes and you lost all the tabs you were saving for future reference and if you somehow miss the restore option when you open back up you lost everything i hate it and im not using this app anymore because they haven t done anything to fix this over the years ive used this app its pretty big deal
len ratingone I don t have all day to watch the Chrome logo and wait for it to open 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingfour Can the tab area button layout be adjusted though 
len ratingfour There s close all new tab and done when you go to the tab area and I think when holding the phone at the bottom of the screen close all can be accidently pushed 
len ratingfour Some times its nice to have that but wouldn t more users be annoyed by accidentally closing their tabs 
len ratingfour Can we get a feature to edit layouts or make it a menu so choices have to be more intentional 
len ratingone  Chrome is forced to only be a wrapper around the worst browser on the web Safari 
len ratingone Apple is the punch line of the web with their horribly old and outdated browser 
len ratingone Safari has not gained any significant support for the modern web in over years 
len ratingone Wake up Apple or you ll be left in the dust 
len ratingfour It s truly a great app but I do have one problem that has occurred within the past few months 
len ratingfour When I go to search something it will show up the things I previously search despite the fact that I deleted my history 
len ratingfour That kind of stuff just annoys me because I dislike pop up recommendations but other than that it s an amazing app that brings knowledge to your finger tips 
len ratingone Daddy Chill 
len ratingfive  The sync is very slow but I like this app anyways I know apps take a long time to finish 
len ratingfive  but you did a great job on this new update anywho 
len ratingfive This is so much more convenient than safari and I m so glad that I downloaded it on my phone 
len ratingfive There are so many shortcuts and features that just make the experience so much better easier and faster 
len ratingfive I would definitely recommend that you download this app 
len ratingone Syncing is broken 
len ratingone I ve tried reinstalling clearing data turning sync on and off nothing works 
len ratingone Makes this browser unusable unless I want to spend hours manually entering addresses passwords payment methods etc 
len ratingone wish they would fix this 
len ratingone  ltimamente la conexi n en Chrome a fallado a diferencia del navegador original Safari que abre en seguida 
len ratingone  Google Chrome is now resorting me to do Captchas for searching the web 
len ratingone What joke 
len ratingone Reluctantly I think I ll be using Bing from now on 
len ratingone  Google Chrome now has news posts appearing in its search page 
len ratingone I hate that 
len ratingone Do they think I really care about J Ho and her strapped swimsuit 
len ratingone  Can t long press to open in new tab anymore 
len ratingone Can t finish typing sentences words in search bar without it deleting the last word I typed as soon as I hit the search button 
len ratingone How does such a large company not notice these things 
len ratingone IOS iPhone whatever the newest version is 
len ratingone I ve said it before that the browsing history can t be viewed in incognito mode but I have to also bring up the fact that the open a new tab button has been moved from the top left of the screen to the bottom right 
len ratingone Why does this matter 
len ratingone Because where the open new tab button used to be is now a big fat button to close all tabs 
len ratingone  Old users may attempt to open a new tab reflexively only to end up tapping the close all tabs button without thinking 
len ratingone A button with such a heavy function should never be put in the open at the very least it should be in a drop down expanded menu 
len ratingone Chrome makes it very easy to close all open tabs but near impossible to restore those tabs 
len ratingone Judging from my extensive searches through help forums and FAQs this has been a problem for years 
len ratingone No steps have been taken to ameliorate this problem 
len ratingone This is by no means the only issue but it is the most frustrating 
len ratingone I use a chromebook for work and chrome on my personal Mac 
len ratingone I wanted to use it on mobile so and sync across my devices 
len ratingone Unfortunately this is a the flaw that broke the camel s back 
len ratingone I ll have to switch to a different browser for mobile 
len ratingone On a desktop chrome is wonderful 
len ratingone Don t get your hopes up by expecting the same experience on mobile 
len ratingone I just decide to give it a star cause it keep popping out in my YouTube ads
len ratingone Find good porn
len ratingtwo The previous update my location was always Atlanta Georgia 
len ratingtwo Isn t bad until up find out I live in Clarksville Tennessee 
len ratingtwo Now it just keeps me as unknown location 
len ratingone This app was sharing my history passwords and other private information with my boss 
len ratingone Just because I was signed in to work email from my pravate laptop 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone I would not expect something like that from google
len ratingone Company just doesn t make anything simple 
len ratingone Can you have a Home button instead of 
len ratingone Confusing cluttered app 
len ratingone  This app never updates 
len ratingone  Someone is logging me out of it I was signed out of my acct tonight
len ratingfive  So i love this app so much since im a iphone user and it only gives you safari so just download this your probably thinking right now that just download goggle well it requiers IOS something and im downloading this on a ipad air my dads ipad he gave to me im getting a ipad pro on Christmas so that will be good but anyway so yeah just come here and download this just like goggle aka it is goggle lol but chrome is just so much better i give this a star im useing this for now on i really request getting this you will NOT regret it
len ratingone  Google Chrome is garbage 
len ratingone This app has massive battery drain 
len ratingone iOS app and windows are terrible updates 
len ratingone Google Chrome is crap 
len ratingfive I have a suggestion on a feature 
len ratingfive This already exists on Android it s the ability to group tabs together on the tab screen 
len ratingfive For people who like organization and to not be so cluttered 
len ratingfive I really want this to exist on Chrome for iOS 
len ratingfive I hope this is helpful 
len ratingone Coming from Android chrome for iOS is pretty much useless 
len ratingone Doesn t apply saved UN or PW to auto fill fields 
len ratingone Some pages won t view can t pan well 
len ratingone Won t load certain pages at all 
len ratingone I have to use chrome on anything but my iPhone cause I love chrome and is seamless across android windows 
len ratingone On iOS it s just sad 
len ratingone I just want chrome as an option 
len ratingone It is forcing me to ap store where I cannot get anything 
len ratingone I just want to install it the same way as my Mac
len ratingfive  ETypical the Trfuyfuytdydyse
len ratingthree The latest update added them but they clearly aren t working at the moment 
len ratingthree  I have to go back to Safari again 
len ratingone it wont download and is asking for my credit card
len ratingfive  I use this app to watch porn
len ratingfour This is such a cool app but the new update my device I use is on a tablet 
len ratingfour I cant use full screen anymore cause of the new update 
len ratingfour I might delete this soon or later but please fix this developers 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingone Maybe there is a way to fix 
len ratingone I plan on going to Apple for there help 
len ratingfour I really enjoy Chrome and I enjoy the lucky the cat game they made in it and i just hate it when I have no WiFi and accidentally goes on a tab while I have no WiFi and play the google dinosaur no WiFi game thing but when I go on a tab I can t go back and I have to redo all the progress I was doing on that tab so I would like if you made it so when you get WiFi again it reloads and your work is saved too
len ratingone This app does not allow me to access certain settings 
len ratingone For example I will check how to enable cookies and I will be sent to Settings gt Advanced settings but the latter does not exist 
len ratingone Managing cookies does not exist under content settings either 
len ratingtwo DIDNFJJDJDJEJSISIDMFJRKS why cant i stick with SAFARIIII
len ratingone  This is the worse browser ever that I used 
len ratingone Nothing ever works and It is very slow 
len ratingone Google do us a favor and end chrome and actually develop an web browser that works 
len ratingone Google is a waste of a company 
len ratingone Never before have I had so much trouble with craigslist lm wasting time when I should be working 
len ratingfive Well not much to this I just plain out love it
len ratingfive I just downloaded Google Chrome to play the dinosaur game but it s pretty good
len ratingfour  And maybe some tracking protection that s it 
len ratingfour Confirming top of page for either Author or Date when reading article causes a page reload wasting resources 
len ratingfour Thanks for Suspend Reload to conserve memory though 
len ratingthree Chrome is great in the fact that it syncs data from a google account 
len ratingthree One huge issue I have is that whenever a new tab is opened the cursor is not automatically in the search bar 
len ratingthree This means you cannot just type and search for something like you can in safari 
len ratingthree You have to click in the search bar and only then can you begin typing 
len ratingthree A little annoyance but can end up robbing you of time in the long run 
len ratingone Will not let me delete any of my recent searches will not be using this web browser anymore 
len ratingfive the title 
len ratingfive i love chrome it s amazing my favorite thing about it is that when you go incognito mode it s a whole separate tab like if you want to buy a family member or friend something and you search it up you can just hide it there and they wouldn t even know you were searching it up or when thought about it which is great 
len ratingone Put back Palestine on the map Palestine from the river to the sea will be free
len ratingone Terrible it is a smile face smirking at me
len ratingthree My chrome has a problem locating when I need directions 
len ratingthree It locates my destination but can t find me 
len ratingthree I changed to regular Google and it works fine
len ratingtwo  I went on Google to search for something and now I can t delete my recent searches 
len ratingtwo Please fix this problem 
len ratingtwo Generally the app fine and I have no complaints 
len ratingtwo But recently it has begun to crash sometimes just one tab in the middle of using it sometimes the whole app closing all my open tabs 
len ratingtwo This happens very frequently and makes using Chrome incredibly irritating 
len ratingtwo I d love an update that fixes whatever the issue is 
len ratingone Recently changed it s a pain to use not worth it 
len ratingone For the love of god google give us a text search feature 
len ratingone Apple s OS gives its user preinstalled 
len ratingone Finds no good search results laggy and uses too much ram no customization and way too slow looks old and gets no support or improvements 
len ratingone Move to DDG browser or Brave and the experience will be somewhat better 
len ratingone TLDR app needs more focus and support for additional features that are maintained 
len ratingone Disappointed
len ratingone  Wouldn t you expect the Google CHROME app to cast to a CHROMECAST 
len ratingfour I really liked Chrome up until now because there was 
len ratingfour A glitch where I couldn t delete some of the things I searched 
len ratingfour Please fix this 
len ratingone My google chrome search won t delete
len ratingone Don t believe the line that Google says in the description on the App Store 
len ratingone It is all a bunch of lies 
len ratingone They are saying that they have added full webpage screenshots like Safari has had for some time now 
len ratingone It isn t true at all 
len ratingone Stick with any other browser that doesn t give users lip service but actually does what they say 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingthree Other than that it s ight
len ratingfive  No puedo descargar washttpp
len ratingone My phone gets so hot now browsing 
len ratingfive  Meow
len ratingthree the app keeps crashing it doesn t respect ur privacy and it ya starting to get annoying
len ratingone I lost my tabs after a crash and couldn t recover them at all from the phone or other computers 
len ratingone Very disruptive 
len ratingone This happened twice this year 
len ratingone I m done with it 
len ratingone Not much point to stick with Google if it won t actually sync what it claims 
len ratingone They should spend less effort on putting ads on YouTube and tracking people and instead stabilize the mobile browser 
len ratingone Wait didn t it used to be stable 
len ratingone It s garbage now in July 
len ratingone  chrome is part of the bully clan that belongs to big bully google 
len ratingone Yes I purposely did not capitalize their names chrome isn t safe as they think they with security 
len ratingone The iPad and IPhone are perfect tools to completely kick google out of your life 
len ratingone When you do OMG I didn t know how sweet life could be 
len ratingone Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Google Chrome Gmail all gone and life is better more peaceful 
len ratingone It feel like the early days when the internet was on dial up but the internet was clean and useful 
len ratingthree Just updated and the new feature to take full page screenshot does not work it doesn t show the option after screenshot has been taken 
len ratingthree Please relocate close all tabs to somewhere you can t hit it by accident has happened many times 
len ratingfive  Yay free screen time
len ratingtwo why does google chrome keep kicking me out of losing all my tabs 
len ratingtwo this is so infuriating 
len ratingtwo it happens every other week or so 
len ratingtwo i should be allowed to leave as many open windows sessions as i want for as long as i want 
len ratingtwo i have them there for a reason either i m not done reading through the page or i want to keep it open to easily get back to it for reference of something 
len ratingtwo please make this stop happening 
len ratingfour I didn t find the option to unlock the traceless tab with Face ID in the privacy settings 
len ratingone  Please 
len ratingfour This is good I get time limit but I watch YouTube on this and to tell you I like something to watch I like tofuu 
len ratingone  Is this APP for iPhone 
len ratingthree Chrome is racist 
len ratingthree So I am a year old roblox gamer and I create cloths here 
len ratingthree I use pixlre E but when I type there and when I cancel it goes back there it takes minutes to wear off Fix this 
len ratingtwo I mostly use chrome as a financial tracking tool 
len ratingtwo The finance app in chrome continually locks up as data won t update charts won t load back arrows won t go back one page but bring you back to google com 
len ratingtwo The finance app needs to be reloaded often to get current data 
len ratingtwo My opinion is their database is overwhelmed and needs more computing power or more databases to handle all the data calls 
len ratingone  Every browser on mobile is terrible in one way or another but Google Chrome has one thing that makes it especially terrible the close all tabs button 
len ratingone It s in the worst possible place on the screen if you have an iphone newer than the and it s way too easy to hit 
len ratingone Never ever ever have I hit the button to close all tabs and meant to do so only ever accidentally and in the worst possible times 
len ratingone That button should not be on the screen at all much less right where it s easy to hit 
len ratingone It s not possible to reopen all the tabs because the history doesn t include enough of them so I m completely out of luck trying to go back to all the important websites I had open 
len ratingone Remove the button 
len ratingone No one uses it it s unnecessary and should be in the options menu not on the main screen 
len ratingone I only use google chrome because safari is worse and microsoft edge crashes and also closes everything I have open 
len ratingone Overall it s an okay app with a terrible layout that desperately needs to be fixed 
len ratingone I will update my review to stars when and if they remove the close all tabs button 
len ratingfive Monke
len ratingtwo chrome isn t bad but privacy is horrible 
len ratingtwo i highly recommend duckduckgo as it has the same functionality but without tracking 
len ratingone Keeps closing tabs and saying it crashed almost every time I open it
len ratingthree I believe the problem started after the last update to Chrome 
len ratingthree I used it on all devices as well as setting husband up to do the same 
len ratingthree It now crashes every time it is open after only a few seconds 
len ratingthree Then when you reopen you have to start all over ahsinn 
len ratingthree If you are watching a video you go Back to the begging and it will crash before the point it ran to with previous crash or it crashes at the exact same spot as the first time 
len ratingthree The videos do not have the ability to run forward 
len ratingthree So if a link from YouTube or other source takes me to chrome I copy the url and open it there 
len ratingthree No problems 
len ratingthree Please fix ASAP 
len ratingone  i look up pornhub to see what comes up and this did thx
len ratingtwo Every time I log in to my iPad lately to use my Google suite it says I have an outdated browser 
len ratingtwo I click the link to check and it says it is ancient 
len ratingtwo I go to update and it says I have the current latest update with Google Chrome 
len ratingtwo I can t even use Slides now on the web 
len ratingtwo So crazy and inefficient 
len ratingtwo My google be acting like safari
len ratingone  Can t long press to open in new tab anymore 
len ratingone chrome is usually good but it keeps crashing for no reason yall cant even make a functioning app 
len ratingone  No
len ratingfive  Samatha is an excellent sales lady 
len ratingfive She is very knowledge about the products she is selling and goes above and beyond to please her customers 
len ratingfive She was a pleasure to work with 
len ratingfive Robert Witman 
len ratingone I CANT DOWNLOAD THE APP
len ratingtwo  there is no seamleass transition to a new phone 
len ratingtwo passwords never sync 
len ratingthree I like the app but the new update has removed the ability to swipe away stories that I already read our have no intention of reading 
len ratingthree Now I have to press on the three dot icon to house the stories 
len ratingone  It looks like there aren t many great matches for your search 
len ratingfive  It has been hour and still have not finished loading
len ratingfive I can play online games Search every thing 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is much MUCH better than the actual Google app 
len ratingfive It offers the same widget features with an interface that is user friendly and in my opinion far better than safari 
len ratingfive This is the superior Google app 
len ratingfive i really love this game its very awesome i can also get information from this game this is very interesting but it awseeome
len ratingtwo I just launched chrome it told me it didn t close properly last time guess it crashed and asked if I wanted to restore the previous session 
len ratingtwo Before I could the pop up went away and there was no way to restore my previous session in the menu they didn t show up in recently closed in fact NOTHING was in recently closed tabs 
len ratingtwo There needs to be a way to restore your session when chrome crashes 
len ratingtwo It works on android but not iphone 
len ratingtwo Google s support just says it s there 
len ratingtwo What happened to the news feed on the home page 
len ratingtwo It disappeared this week
len ratingone  Switching from mobile to desktop and back shouldn t be so hard 
len ratingone It s unusable for Office Outlook mail 
len ratingone It s impossible to read articles now 
len ratingone This was never an issue before up until a month ago 
len ratingone Tabs constantly reloading then crashing killing my battery life 
len ratingone When I open the same number of tabs on Firefox I get no issues on the same articles 
len ratingone I ve tried reinstalling and still get the same problem 
len ratingone And if this because I have an iPhone looks like Google doesn t care about older models 
len ratingtwo This app looks and feels old 
len ratingfive  I hate Google chrome it s terrible it should be removed from the App Store it s shouldI hate Google chrome it s terrible it should be removed from the App Store it s should be removed from the App Store forever it should be if it s not I m going to sue Google for no good be removed from the App Store forever it should be if it s not I m going to sue Google for no reason I will I swear I will I ll just remove it from the App Store and the website and wherever you can download Google Chrome remove it even from the play store if you have an android tablet even from the Amazon App Store even from a PKP or even from Zeus for up for iOS even from Roblox it should not exist if it does exist for longer than hours of this existing I will sue Google for billion dollars for not removing it from the App Store or at least the play store really I will send this I have an android tablet I will read Google Chrome this exact same thing in the same sentence and I m going to copy and paste it into Google and I m going to change everything that says App Store to Google play and make sure it s removed from every single store in the world including Google s website or I will sue Google million this is a joke 
len ratingthree It keeps crashing on iphone 
len ratingthree Especially any time I use facebook 
len ratingthree Super annoying 
len ratingone When I Made My Child A Account it tried To Take My Credit Card Number 
len ratingtwo  Unlike iOS in iOS Chrome no longer knows what other apps are installed 
len ratingtwo In or click on a YouTube video link in Chrome and it will say open in app 
len ratingtwo In it no longer does that 
len ratingtwo Same with Google Maps links 
len ratingtwo Click on a Maps link and it will just open a new browser page with the web version of Maps 
len ratingtwo As far as other non Google apps are concerned the usual open in app just takes me to the AppStore in iOS where in it opens the actual app example Facebook and Twitter links in Chrome 
len ratingtwo So basically in Chrome knows where to go 
len ratingtwo In Chrome has no idea 
len ratingtwo Not sure if this is an apple issue or not but heads up Chrome integration with both Google apps and other third party apps in is broken and needs to be corrected or you ll have a bunch of complaints come September 
len ratingthree This is my go to app for browsing on my phone but they just changed it so now the bar at the bottom is too close to the bottom of the screen making it difficult to click when I trying to hit the back button 
len ratingthree My phone recognizes it as my trying to swipe up
len ratingthree  I can t tell you how many times I ve accidentally hit the Close All button and closed all of my tabs 
len ratingthree It s located at the bottom left corner 
len ratingthree When I m typing the palm of my hand sometimes triggers it 
len ratingthree POOF 
len ratingthree ALL TABS GONE 
len ratingthree The recent tabs list doesn t show all of the tabs you just closed and you can t restore them like you can on a desktop Chrome browser 
len ratingthree MOVE THE BUTTON 
len ratingtwo Deleting chrome since apparently there s a mandate to recapitulate every built in iOS feature except in a crappy almost works way 
len ratingtwo God help you if you try to use iOS native gestures on a webpage with chrome and google AMP 
len ratingfour I love using chrome over safari I like how it looks and I always had an easier times using chrome over safari but it has one glaring issue that I don t like you can t increase or decrease the size of the screen while on safari you can just tap the upper right corner and increase or decrease the screen size there just isn t a way to do this on chrome and it seem like such a easy thing to add besides this I have no other problems with chrome 
len ratingone I will give it a zero out of but if I come back on here I m getting a out of 
len ratingone U should fix close all tabs u should add confirm button
len ratingone Cancel please
len ratingfive  Good stu
len ratingone i m losing my mind over this seriously 
len ratingone every website loads within a millisecond because i have t mobiles unlimited g high speed data plan and i have bars almost all the time but whenever i open chrome google is the default browser IT NEVER LOADS 
len ratingone every other website works perfectly fine 
len ratingone i tried reinstalling the app 
len ratingone i tried deleting all the cache 
len ratingone i tried resetting my network settings on my phone 
len ratingone i tried getting tmobile themselves to reset my network and literally even change cell towers and nothing 
len ratingone i EVEN REPLACED MY PHONE 
len ratingone and google doesn t load 
len ratingone i cannot understand this whatsoever and nothing helps 
len ratingone what s stupid is the website sometimes loads times but if i try going back to google it doesn t again 
len ratingone like google is the fundamental website EVERYONE uses to navigate the internet 
len ratingone and i cannot use it 
len ratingone so i m uninstalling this app and never using it again 
len ratingfive This app is very good for hiding my search history
len ratingone It s GARBAGE
len ratingfive  I love google it is where you can find things you have always wondered
len ratingone  Not good enough
len ratingfour Look chrome is great and all I originally pefer how it was before the discover showed up on a new tab 
len ratingfour Also still google has not fixed the crashing and closing all tabs and the user cannot recover them all only like 
len ratingfour If you want all your tabs just stick with safari instead of google chrome 
len ratingone  Update on July th problem bug still not fixed Will not stop refreshing tabs if this is not fixed I will delete the app 
len ratingone Hhhh
len ratingthree  Personally it s the best web browser but I recommend using only on a laptop or computer 
len ratingfive This browser is really fun 
len ratingfive They have a Dino game Easter egg and now they add a widget 
len ratingtwo Ok 
len ratingtwo So this is why I give google chrome TWO stars 
len ratingtwo I was on my laptop and I left my normal google account to go sign into my school account 
len ratingtwo Then when I tried signing back into my usual account it kept saying I forgot my password and clearly I didn t because I just used it last week 
len ratingtwo So then I had to first use my phone number to restart 
len ratingtwo And then it asked me to use my Gmail on my phone 
len ratingtwo Of course I tried but never got a verification code 
len ratingtwo Then I tried my iphone mail app and of course I had to try several times 
len ratingtwo In the end it made me loose most of my progress on my laptop 
len ratingtwo Thanks for making my day difficult This was not manly at all 
len ratingfour I m updated to the newest version and am using an iPhone XS Max 
len ratingfour But the app frequently will just go back to my app Home Screen and when I click on it again it says chrome encountered an error and didn t shut down properly ultimately it will restore all of my tabs but it happens like x a day
len ratingthree  So before I used to use this app all the dang time but now it s and I m so now it s not on my home screen and I can t delete it and now I gotta wait years to delete it 
len ratingfive  Well loser jk same
len ratingone You are a disgusting company 
len ratingone To spy on phones and sell us 
len ratingone You should be ashamed of yourselves 
len ratingone Grow a soul 
len ratingone Chrome s tracking and data mining are so far beyond what s necessary for app functionality that it s basically spyware 
len ratingone Before you download this compare Chrome s App Privacy disclosures especially Data Linked to You to the same data for Firefox Brave or Qwant 
len ratingone Even Edge isn t as bad 
len ratingone It s also a bloated resource hog 
len ratingone And it s even worse on a Mac or PC see the Chrome is Bad website with instructions on how to totally remove it from your Mac since it isn t enough to just delete it or Google Chrome sucks here s why you should stop using it on TNW 
len ratingone Your mom is stinky So is google chrome
len ratingthree Why did you change Discover to these giant cards 
len ratingthree More difficult to scroll through and they kinda look like ads now 
len ratingthree Sad as this used to be enjoyable for me 
len ratingthree No interest in browsing anymore 
len ratingthree At least give the option in settings for previous size 
len ratingfive I m love it because I can go on a website and then I can find an anime wallpaper and make it as my wall paper 
len ratingfive And I can access different apps
len ratingfive  Whoever gave this app lower than stars is just dumb they just think it s bad because it so good doesn t make any sense why people would give this star
len ratingfour Anyway to change the discover feed back to the old style 
len ratingfour This is really big and almost obtrusive 
len ratingone Google did a bad and teamed up with autism speaks who just wants to cure autism 
len ratingone It s not an illness how do i uninstall on this stupid apple phone 
len ratingthree I like this website chrome and all but when I tried to download scratchy Addons it said For Google chrome only but I am on chrome
len ratingtwo This app isn t bad 
len ratingtwo But it constantly will freeze and delete all of the tabs you have open 
len ratingtwo I m honestly going to un install 
len ratingtwo I m tired of loosing all of the information I have due to this error in the system 
len ratingfive It s chome man just appreciate it
len ratingtwo I hate the new Discover feature 
len ratingtwo Articles that I have no interest in show up and they are difficult to hide 
len ratingtwo I troubleshooted and figured out how to hide and set some of the settings to not bring up certain topics but it doesn t work 
len ratingone Automatically pasted something from my desktop to my iPhone now I cannot stop getting the alert chrome pasted from iMac 
len ratingone Get the banner a dozen times in a minute and unable to turn it off 
len ratingfour  Girls
len ratingfive You have ralent
len ratingone I get the error the file could not be downloaded at this time whenever I try to download PDFs 
len ratingone This is very frustrating 
len ratingone Others having the same problem no one has found a solution 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingtwo Every time I open chrome it creates a new blank tab
len ratingfour So from you photo library you can search photos like imacs and a PC please add this ty
len ratingone  This is fake as the person that hacked my iPhone 
len ratingone Yes this is the one and only real mf on here 
len ratingone  Not sure if it was related to an update but I lost my tabs after a crash and couldn t recover them at all from the phone or other computers 
len ratingone Very disruptive 
len ratingone I ll have to limit usage of Chrome and only keep important tabs in Safari 
len ratingone Not much point to stick with Google if it won t actually sync what it claims 
len ratingone They should spend less effort on putting ads on YouTube and tracking people and instead stabilize the mobile browser 
len ratingfive I use this to watch porn and it works great 
len ratingfive I prefer chrome over safari any day 
len ratingthree Can we get a feature and or setting that allows us to turn off unencrypted websites so we are not put at unnecessary risk while browsing 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfive Good but a big big issue 
len ratingfive Chrome does not think it is Chrome 
len ratingfour I like it but when i try to look up stuff it takes forever
len ratingthree  Otherwise great browser but you can t use the two finger touch as a right click 
len ratingthree On Brave and Safari you can 
len ratingtwo As much as I would like to trust it I can t 
len ratingtwo This browser refuses to stop logging data when it s closed 
len ratingtwo It continues even after I disconnected it from WiFi and Cellular Data as noted by the symbols 
len ratingtwo I like it but I can t trust that it s disconnected 
len ratingone No matter how up to date my device and the app is it constantly crashes 
len ratingone Not only that if the screen times out it kicks me off of the app and has to reload everything 
len ratingone I don t know why this is seeing as how on my android and previously on desktop this has never happened but I don t think I ll be using this app on here anymore until it s fixed 
len ratingone When I try to make a t shirt on Roblox it says it s not an image but it is I will sue this app
len ratingone I used to use it all the time and I loved it but just look up who ruined me beast AND THEN YOU LL SEE WHY 
len ratingone GOD I HATE YOU GOOGLE 
len ratingfive this makes feel like I m actally on computer stars for sure
len ratingfive  I had a great experience beginning to end 
len ratingfive Dora was very professional and very knowledgeable 
len ratingfive She explained to me everything she was doing each step of the way 
len ratingfive And my skin looks amazing 
len ratingfive I can t wait to come back and do my next treatment 
len ratingfive I would definitely recommend radiance Rx to anybody looking to really make a change in their skin 
len ratingone If nobody has noticed that in landscape mode on any given web page with a chat or text box to enter a message that the bottom bar covers up the ability to see what you re typing then they haven t even tested their product or used it ever 
len ratingone This browser is unusable on most occasions for reasons like this 
len ratingone I can show you what I mean with a screenshot but if only reviews allowed this 
len ratingone  I m really surprised Chrome doesn t have an option to use desktop version of websites instead of the mobile 
len ratingone Safari Brave Firefox and I m sure Edge have this option 
len ratingone Why doesn t Chrome 
len ratingone Anyways I also stopped using Chrome over privacy concerns 
len ratingone Why people still recommend Chrome on mobile and desktop is beyond me 
len ratingfive  As usual everything was perfect I so appreciate your service I need to put another order in so I ll call later thanks bye
len ratingone I often want online content in English and in Spanish 
len ratingone The app won t offer translation to Spanish from English 
len ratingone The option is greyed out 
len ratingone When I change my phone s language to Spanish then it allowed the option but no matter how many times I tried to choose it it would go back to the not offered option 
len ratingone I waisted a while trying to figure this out 
len ratingone Too bad since the Google web translator is So good 
len ratingone Why not implement right it in the app 
len ratingone Deleted and reloaded bu app keep crashing after minutes of use 
len ratingone Especially on Facebook 
len ratingone Use safari and zero issue 
len ratingone Man that is irritating 
len ratingone I am deleting 
len ratingone I have a bunch of Venus flytraps 
len ratingone One of them was dying so I tried looking up how to stop your Venus flytraps from dying and it said take care of your plants better next time That was the rudest thing anyone ever told me 
len ratingone Make your app better next time 
len ratingfour I personally LOVE GMAIL but wish they would have it work with APPLE WATCH 
len ratingone  No way to block ads like with the desktop app 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingfive I like Google Chrome but Yahoo page is coming up in it and I don t know what to do Thanks
len ratingfour Jeejdbehbfehwbfehbfwhbfjhwjbhfewbfhjsdb
len ratingfive My go to app for several decades 
len ratingone  Shame on you how can you help illegal country that is constructed on the palestinas blood making a contract with Israel is a crime shameeee shameee on you
len ratingtwo I have three google accounts for work personal and misc 
len ratingtwo I like the synch function in google so you can access bookmarks from multiple browsers 
len ratingtwo However it is not intuitive to switch between google accounts on google 
len ratingtwo You have a choice to remove or manage the account 
len ratingtwo Not switch 
len ratingtwo Kinda amateur hour here 
len ratingtwo Fix this so it s easy to switch Between accounts please 
len ratingone After the latest update the program crashes on open 
len ratingone It s unusable
len ratingthree It says that I need to download chrome but I already have chrome 
len ratingone  This app never updates 
len ratingone  Someone is logging me out of it 
len ratingone  I waited minutes for a tech support and still waiting I installed a new service which is not working since day one I am going to cancel this stupid service 
len ratingone Floating Video on top of the screen playing feature not working for YouTube in crome the aplication is crushing
len ratingone I deleted it to fix something and now I can t redownload it
len ratingfive Easily integrates with desktop experience 
len ratingfive Password and all that jazz works well 
len ratingfive Probably my favorite feature is sharing links to desktop session very simple to do 
len ratingfive Previous bugs that were annoying have been fixed 
len ratingfive Increasing ratings to stars to reflect this
len ratingone  Im unable to save files from a link 
len ratingone Makes this browser and apple feel very limited compared to what you can do on other tablets 
len ratingone do not recommend for people who need to do more than read one or two webpages
len ratingthree It s on and off 
len ratingthree Some days you have fast internet and other days it says no internet 
len ratingthree Made me question my wifi but nope just this app
len ratingfive I don t like that when you have two of the same Applications time enter one then if you look at the other one it shows a different screen
len ratingtwo La aplicaci n es muy lenta es DEMASIADO complicada de usar y adem s los anuncios es como si fueran los reyes
len ratingtwo Crashes too much and even crashes after trying to restore all closed tabs please fix 
len ratingfive It is what it is
len ratingone I m deleting Chrome from my iPad 
len ratingone It makes hard tow browse Google s websites 
len ratingone It s ridiculous I have to use Safari to browse Google s websites 
len ratingone When using Chrome half of the websites are in the dark theme other half in light 
len ratingone With Safari everything seems okay 
len ratingone Google censorship has gone to far 
len ratingone Google would rather feed you lies than let you search for the truth
len ratingone Let s you see gross things in images
len ratingtwo IOS version is so bad that it makes safari look good
len ratingone it s been bugging out for months i ve just been dealing with it since I prefer Chrome I came from an android so using chrome seems better to me than Safari 
len ratingone every time I go onto the screen where all my tabs are it clicks on a random tab and i m writing this review after it cleared all of my tabs after exiting the app
len ratingone I am using a global shadowsocks client Wingy for my iPad 
len ratingone The add account button is either timeout or ssl error 
len ratingone So stupid to not allow picture in picture
len ratingfive Let s be honest we re pretty much only here for Intogito
len ratingfive  Why do updates take so long to come out 
len ratingone  There are zero options for customization of Chrome on iOS 
len ratingone  Unable to set a default home new tab page Language settings for google products search do not stick and reset to the iOS language with each new tab or use of the URL bar
len ratingtwo The app works fine but need the option to make the app full screen 
len ratingtwo Please let hide the tool bar
len ratingone I searched google plan and said secret plan take over the whole world
len ratingtwo This is a recent issue but makes the app virtually unusable which is unfortunate because it s my go to web browser 
len ratingtwo It crashes on EVERY SINGLE WEB PAGE I VISIT 
len ratingtwo Doesn t matter what it is but it keeps crashing after a few seconds 
len ratingtwo I ve updated the app deleted and redownloaded the app restarted my device and NOTHING WORKS 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingone Why is there of googles
len ratingone  The app keeps crashing and websites not loading 
len ratingone Horrible app 
len ratingthree Not enough
len ratingfive  Honey Trost loves google love you blah blah blah blah 
len ratingtwo This app used to be great but something in the last few releases has made holding down on a link to be able to copy or open in a new tab stop working so I keep having to uninstall and reinstall to the app 
len ratingtwo Over and over and over 
len ratingtwo Sometime it crash on ipad pro 
len ratingtwo Do not work properly or can t understand my command 
len ratingthree  Google disabled my account I was on a school chromebook and my account was disabled all I was doing before was watching videos and doing school stuff and it was disabled the next day 
len ratingthree I am doing everything I can but I cannot get it back 
len ratingthree I m not sure why so stars because it randomly disabled my account 
len ratingthree There are still some more bugs and glitches so if not including account disables stars 
len ratingfive  great for watching porn on
len ratingfive  It s a great site too use you can use any website without cookies it s amazing and even private websiting is great 
len ratingthree Works great but with the latest update it crashes all the tabs if you close the app 
len ratingthree Also I don t like the placement of the close all tabs button as it is really easy to accidentally tap it especially as a left handed person and there is no confirmation or an option to confirm before closing all tabs 
len ratingthree By comparison Safari requires you to long press the tabs button before being able to close all tabs and Firefox you have to tap two buttons before you can close all tabs 
len ratingone Good when it works but completely interrupts workflow when malfunctions all the time 
len ratingone The lack of stop auto play and lack of cookies settings is just laughable
len ratingthree I can t watch some videos on my iPad and it bugs me 
len ratingone  Make saving and editing bookmarks make sense 
len ratingone  Make a button to go directly to your bookmarks maybe just touching the url bar instead of bringing up that short list of recent sites bring up the user s bookmarks like it does in Safari 
len ratingone That is a no brainer so much more convenient 
len ratingone  An option to stop the tabs bar from scrolling on off on off on off on off on off on off on off on off and just keep it there so instead of driving people absolutely crazy it just stays there not making people hate Chrome 
len ratingfive it knows what i want 
len ratingfive i searched kaeya and it showed me exactly what i hoped for 
len ratingfive  stars def
len ratingone STOP PROMPTING ME TO DOWNLOAD GOOGLE DEVICE MANAGER 
len ratingone i m about to exclusively use safari 
len ratingone make it stop 
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingthree Close a tab 
len ratingthree Crash 
len ratingthree Launch the app 
len ratingthree Freeze 
len ratingthree It s like they don t want us to use the app so they can t gleefully mine our data anymore 
len ratingfive  Make it work
len ratingthree I love chrome due to its compatibility across all my devices but for some reason the performance is sub par on an iPhone when I have no issues running chrome on a cheap android tablet 
len ratingone  That is all
len ratingone still designed as a mobile browser 
len ratingone can t even load it s own website lol
len ratingone  A years old kid could ve done a better app
len ratingtwo Please please please remove the adult and sex pages from chrome and websites the viewers use 
len ratingtwo I m sure there are better ads and pop ups than just the trashy ones I ve stopped using chrome for this reason 
len ratingtwo I do hope you ll clean up chrome so we could use it again 
len ratingone Last week I was able to airplay to my tv and this week no I can t funny how I updated everything the tv and phone troubleshooted and nothing helps the only thing different is google chrome update 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone It gave my a restore tabs option but it did nothing so thanks for that
len ratingtwo Love this app but since the new update it keeps crashing 
len ratingtwo It s crashed on me times in the last minutes 
len ratingtwo Frustrating and I might move back to safari until they figure this out 
len ratingone I don t know if this is just my device but when I log into Google Forms it automatically scrolls up when I m working on a question 
len ratingone It s only got questions and starts scrolling on its own 
len ratingone Allow users to opt into AMP 
len ratingone App is a complete waste due tot he intrusive and FORCED usage of AMP links that completely ruin the user experience 
len ratingone Whoever created this wasted brain cells developing a new form of cancer 
len ratingthree you can t have a dark mode iphone and light mode chrome or vice versa 
len ratingthree it s annoying because i have dark mode iphone but i hate dark mode browsers and i can t change it 
len ratingthree it s better than safari by far but because of that it s stars
len ratingfive  This app is so good
len ratingone  you censored billion people 
len ratingfive  I can watch porn
len ratingtwo I had this problem a few years ago and it seems to have started back again 
len ratingtwo Everytime I exit the app and come back on the app refreshes and it s very annoying especially if I was logged into a site doing something I would then have to log in over and over everytime I exit and open back the app 
len ratingtwo And no my background app refresh is not on 
len ratingtwo This seems like an issue that needs to be addressed Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingtwo With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps
len ratingone the original interface of chrome where the tab was in the upper right hand corner was the pinnacle of this app 
len ratingone updates are useless and only get in the way the grid tabs are clunky and awful for people with sensory issues 
len ratingone looking for a new browser app to replace this terrible one as i speak 
len ratingfive May you insert audiobook also in the searching 
len ratingfive We can search web images shipping books and so on Can you add audiobooks 
len ratingfive Thanks good app
len ratingthree Not sure what happened 
len ratingthree But I the suggested auto fill hasn t been working 
len ratingthree It ll list the options and clear once you select one 
len ratingthree But text won t generate 
len ratingthree I m switching to something else until it s fixed 
len ratingone Doesn t want to download on version What am I going to do
len ratingone This browser is so bad it keeps crashing and I can t recover my tabs witch is really annoying
len ratingone ITS BROKEN YOU WILL GET A VIRUS I GOT ONE ON THE FIRST DAY DO NOT DOWNLOAD
len ratingfive It has everything
len ratingthree It needs to support Apple AirPlay and cast to TV capabilities 
len ratingtwo It s a nice browser but it has limitations like not being able to download and save pdf files or add an ics calendar file to the Google calendar app 
len ratingtwo Works fine in Android but not iOS
len ratingfive  Great browser for mobile
len ratingone YeA
len ratingone Are Google Chrome devs making this app buggy to degrade the IOS experience in favor of their own ecosystem 
len ratingone For example in this latest app even with Password offer to save turned off it still gives the dialog box and saves the passwords in Chrome 
len ratingone Annoying little stuff not big but still it adds up 
len ratingfive  Hey
len ratingone I absolutely hate that I cannot delete old searches 
len ratingone This is pure trash 
len ratingone  I can t turn off safe search 
len ratingone This is my phone 
len ratingone I don t allow people to use my phone 
len ratingone Why can t I turn off safe search 
len ratingone Sure there might be some gory imagery but that s fine 
len ratingone I m trying to do something 
len ratingone Please don t ask and please understand 
len ratingone Just allow me to turn off safe search 
len ratingone Like when I don t have my account synced 
len ratingone I don t like it when people see what I search like Trevor Henderson s creatures with gory images 
len ratingone You don t have to put safe search you can just ask at the beginning of the app if they want safe search on or off 
len ratingone Typically this is what you guys do Me Turns off safe search Chrome Keeps safe search on Me Logs out of account Reattempts to turn off safe search Chrome Keeps safe search on Literally what is this 
len ratingone You don t have to keep safe search on for that typical reason 
len ratingone You aren t the boss of what you want people to search 
len ratingone If you are just trying to keep things in an order then sorry to say because of that option safari is far more popular 
len ratingone Just please don t turn on safe search 
len ratingone  I swore I would never use another Apple product after purchasing iPads for the whole family then they came out with a new one with everything 
len ratingone Not made of money by any means 
len ratingone So now using my sons iPhone 
len ratingone Took me a zillion tries to log in and now wondering if I got changed for this app 
len ratingfour Overall I m happy with the app 
len ratingfour There are a few things that need work but the biggest complaint I have is when I want to change to a different tab that is open 
len ratingfour I use the tab button at the bottom that indicates the number of tabs opened 
len ratingfour This is fine 
len ratingfour however when you want to just view or switch to a different tab you first have to wait for a different tab to open because it automatically opens one of the tabs 
len ratingfour It would be nice if it would just wait for user input instead of automatically opening a tab 
len ratingtwo  Constantly loses progress Videos can only be played at a max of p Finicky UI
len ratingthree The issue I ve run into while using Google Chrome is that it can and will crash on you at the most in opportune time and not allow you to recover any of the closed tabs it so hopefully closed for you 
len ratingthree This is all fine and dandy if you can easily find your stuff again however if you re in the middle of doing something and in great need of using Google Chrome and not maneuvering between all of your tabs you lose whatever you were working on 
len ratingthree So as I said the app is great when it works but keep in mind if it is the most in opportune time for you to lose your tabs it will crash on you and not give you the option to restore closed tabs 
len ratingone I dont use it because it keeps changing 
len ratingone It was great and then some dude decided hey lets ruin the UX 
len ratingone We see you blocking information and only showing a certain narrative 
len ratingone Americans know what you re doing 
len ratingone We will take you down with the DS 
len ratingone Tabs randomly close
len ratingone  My videos My photos My information taken without permission and not given back but kept safe by google for me 
len ratingone If I took someone s belongings and wouldn t give it back because I was keeping it for them I d be in trouble 
len ratingthree After the new update i found a big issue 
len ratingthree When i use this app after few minutes it makes my device too much hot and its not normal either it costs too much battery for example for each minutes my battery comes down a percent 
len ratingthree Please solve this software problem
len ratingfive  Facebook
len ratingtwo It used to work good but now it deletes all of my tabs 
len ratingtwo I can t even restore them and everyone I get on the app it crashes 
len ratingtwo Fix your glitches and bugs ASAP 
len ratingfive its an amazing app i love it so much you can look up food recipes tutorials diy hacks and much more
len ratingone Not usable 
len ratingone No matter what it freezes and closes 
len ratingone Frustrating 
len ratingone  Google does not support free speech 
len ratingone They close accounts on anyone who mentions Covid or the vaccines 
len ratingone These are not vaccines they are bio chemical jabs masks area hoax 
len ratingfour This works great but it takes up a lot of storage so from time to time I will have to delete also they updated it a lot sense the last time I used it all this buttons on it and icons just make it much harder but overall besides those cons it works perfectly and on mobile when u enter the app it gives u trending news which is helpful instead of going to yahoo or the newspaper paper app So yeah besides all of that jaz recommended
len ratingone  Why because when I type in youtube com it says nether screentime passcode yes I did the download trick but it needs a passcode to redownload I noticed that happened to other apps I told my mom to fix it she said I need to use YouTube kids and I m and I watch YouTube the regular one in my pc I tried my pc and relief no screen time passcode why because my pc runs win not Mac no need to fix I will try my moms YT to fix it
len ratingfive I love this Bae 
len ratingtwo  The app is stupid the search is very bad and the app is very bad
len ratingone  when i open google map link don t let it open this stupid app
len ratingfive How much longer do people have to wait for Google froggy to appear on Google search weather on iOS iPhones 
len ratingfive Hopefully soon 
len ratingtwo Ok so I love chrome I can do anything with it but then I found a cool app in it called chrome web store everyone said it was pretty good so I wanted to give it a try but then it said something weird and I didn t want to do anything bad on my iPad because you never know what will happen later so yeah but it s still kinda good 
len ratingone  Google is biased and supports the murder of Palestinians at the hand of the terrorists Zionist Israelis 
len ratingone Boycott
len ratingfive When doing a search Chrome does not always address the specifics so I have to try and find new keywords 
len ratingfive All in all though I have learned to ride the wild wave and deal with the ups and downs 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Alphabet Youtube Jigsaw Palantir Facebook Microsoft Twitter and many other companies that depend on the integrity of Alphabet and companies 
len ratingtwo Freezes all the time on my pro max no matter what I try 
len ratingone  When was the Palestinian scarf considered as a terrorist symbol 
len ratingone Where ia Palstine on the maps 
len ratingone You guys are showing us how biased your are on the Palestinin and israeli case 
len ratingone We don t support racism 
len ratingone ughhh they sent me a mail drop but i can t see it 
len ratingone last time it showed up a day later
len ratingthree The privacy is terrible but the keychain and such are very useful 
len ratingthree I don t recommend getting this unless you want to try out the pride month Easter egg by searching pride month 
len ratingthree Then delete the app honestly
len ratingtwo App still randomly crashing and closing all tabs even though I have been reporting it for over a year 
len ratingtwo I give up 
len ratingtwo I ll just use safari 
len ratingtwo  It is very terrible 
len ratingtwo The app is very bad
len ratingone  It s becoming really tedious using the app 
len ratingone  Google is showing images of Palestine traditional head cover as terrorists clothes This is so racist and judgmental And it s equivalent to support the Zion s killing forces committing genocide and ethnic cleansing against Palestinians Shame on you google 
len ratingtwo It s exhausting to have to go through tabs and bookmark them one by one 
len ratingtwo Please let us bookmark all tabs at once like you can on PC or on Safari s app 
len ratingtwo Chrome has crashed several times before and on my iPhone it sometimes won t even let me recover the tabs which is infuriating if you have more than open 
len ratingtwo Chrome also crashed on me as I was trying to bookmark incognito tabs so I lost all of those tabs and I m super upset right now 
len ratingone Hi I love your app pls make it less storage bc my iPad is only GB
len ratingone  Free palestine Gaza Westbank 
len ratingfive Ok goggle is really good because I m learning a lot
len ratingtwo  Seae Mx c k csss was mms De Mnszzz a Zoegm and Max Zoheb m m
len ratingone  If you don t want to be able to research and think for yourself 
len ratingone If you want your results filtered to allow for only one opinion 
len ratingone If you want to be tracked and monitored 
len ratingone This is a great service 
len ratingone Otherwise use something else 
len ratingone I consider myself to be someone who likes to know all sides of the news and draw my own conclusions 
len ratingone Google simply does not allow any opinions other than their own 
len ratingone It s anti free speech 
len ratingone If one cannot speak freely then none can 
len ratingtwo  So when i tried downloading chrome it says its for 
len ratingtwo You can just restrict it to age 
len ratingtwo I xant download chrome bc its for and i have to get apps for 
len ratingtwo I wonder why you guys couldn t make it and ALWAYS first start off with restrictions features 
len ratingtwo Also when the child tries to exit the restriction features and have fun They need a parent to provide that from happening 
len ratingone  Free Palestine
len ratingfive  Bruh
len ratingone  Clearing Palestine name from the maps liking it he Palestinian cofia to negative things and more and more of standing against human rights 
len ratingtwo I have been using chrome instead of safari the last few years on my phone and like a decade on my computer 
len ratingtwo I like that all the bookmarks and everything are synched now between devices and chrome usually worked better for certain types of media in my experience 
len ratingtwo However recently it has been SO SLOW and having trouble loading webpages sometimes only loading the top half 
len ratingtwo When I switched to safari it was fine and fast 
len ratingtwo Idk if it s a poor update a compatibility thing or an intentional apple conspiracy to get us using safari but it s annoying 
len ratingtwo It also keeps crashing 
len ratingone  I never would use chrome if chrome honored your usage of another one yet chrome forces you to use 
len ratingone Not cool 
len ratingone I consider your app to be evil as it uses your information without consent 
len ratingone Never update 
len ratingtwo New update has caused some weird bugs 
len ratingtwo When using the address bar the bottom half of the text us cut off 
len ratingtwo This is also causing issues with trying to select text as it bugs out and doesn t let you select text anymore 
len ratingtwo When attempting to double click a word in the address bar it doesn t actually select it 
len ratingtwo Double clicking leads to searching a related word or phrase you ve already typed 
len ratingone  Where is Palestine 
len ratingone Are you ignoring country nation people culture and heritage of Palestinians 
len ratingone It is disgusting 
len ratingone  This app is designed to monitor you so they can market to you 
len ratingone They actively censor you if they don t like you and manipulate search results 
len ratingfive  just love it
len ratingone I decided to get the chrome browser because recently google has made the Google Account settings for iPhone users so insanely limited and difficult to use on Safari that I was forced to download Chrome 
len ratingone When I downloaded it my main consolation was that at least I could access the chrome extensions by customising the experimental features on the chrome flags site 
len ratingone Then I downloaded this joke of an app and discovered to my horror that Google has completely removed ALL the useful features that the chrome flags site used to have 
len ratingone They ve even removed the toolbar and menu options and when you go to read Google s help articles for instructions on how to customise the app all those instructions are still written for the previous update so they re literally useless and inaccurate instructions meaning you aren t even allowed to be given instructions on how to use this radically different chrome app 
len ratingone So essentially Google doesn t want you to be able to customise their app in any way shape or form and they ve decided that we shall all be forced to share the same boring non customisable browser experience 
len ratingone And what s sad is that the only thing that used to set Chrome apart from other browsers was the wonderful chrome store with its countless extensions and plugin options 
len ratingone Now chrome is just a useless app no better than the Google s page on safari with no purpose besides tracking your data and rapidly draining your battery 
len ratingone I m deleting this travesty and get Edge or Firefox literally any app browser would be better than Chrome after this disgraceful update 
len ratingone And I m ending my Google Suite Enterprise subscription and transferring my data from Google s cloud services 
len ratingone There must be other companies with better alternatives than this mess 
len ratingone This update has made it clear that Google s new bussines model is set on punishing iPhone users for not having androids instead of innovating better apps or making useable products 
len ratingone And if google thinks these limitations for iOS apps will convince iPhone users to buy a Google phone then they re sorely mistaken 
len ratingone  Free Palestine
len ratingone Every single time I use Chrome I have a problem where it won t let me close any tabs or open any new ones 
len ratingone I have to completely restart the program and it happens multiple times a day 
len ratingfive  This game it s a fun game bc you can play a game in that game like you can play Roblox com or you can play Minecraft com or something like that so I play this game for yrs wow I can t know that but here we are
len ratingtwo  desktop mode can not play video on ipados safari have no problem please fix 
len ratingtwo Also add option for user to enable desktop mode as default since this is a ipados chrome flags can but videos can not play normally 
len ratingtwo  Randomly whenever I search for a movie the Google overview page doesn t come up as the first result 
len ratingtwo This was an extremely useful feature and for no reason it s now difficult to find the film overview when googling movies
len ratingtwo  I m here because of the disgusting answer you get when you ask google what do terrorist wear on their head 
len ratingone Biased
len ratingone I may be from the USA but the fact you actually censor Palestine a NATION is depressing 
len ratingone Google search results suggest Palestinian keffiyeh a symbol of terrorism The iconic Palestinian keffiyeh a chequered black and white scarf that is usually worn around the head or neck is the preferred headgear for terrorists according to Google 
len ratingone The keffiyeh is a symbol of Palestinian nationalism that was made famous in the s by the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
len ratingone It is widely considered a symbol of Palestinian solidarity 
len ratingone This is hateful and racist 
len ratingone Update The link issues may have resolved from my former review but now this update is freezing and whenever I try to do the hold down option to open in a new tab or any of the related features to that it won t even pop that menu up half of the time 
len ratingone I ve had to restart the app dozens of times a day sometimes several times in a row just to load some websites and attempt to gain the aforementioned menu back 
len ratingone Idk what the deal is you guys used to be so much better 
len ratingone Also equally important STOP 
len ratingone SELLING 
len ratingone MY 
len ratingone INFORMATION 
len ratingone Thx 
len ratingone Chrome used to work beautifully on my iPhone but now half of the links I open don t work or they open formatted all wrong 
len ratingone It all happened after the latest iOS update so I have a hunch this is an Apple issue and not a Google issue but please fix it either way 
len ratingone Censoring free speech is NOT the responsibility of Facebook 
len ratingone If someone doesn t like a post it s their right to block or comment but not Facebook s right to deny them the freedom to say what they think 
len ratingone FB does nothing about the evil of pedophilia no problem not censoring that 
len ratingone FB checkers are so wrong so much of the time that have become a joke 
len ratingone Being censored by FB is laughable and a joke 
len ratingone Offensive hateful and racist app 
len ratingone Bias 
len ratingone Double standard save palestine
len ratingone Dreadful small fonts that cant be changed on iPads engineers get paid how much 
len ratingone Their irritating pop ups won t go away Scam scam scam
len ratingone Is trash and racism
len ratingone  It trash use DuckDuckGo
len ratingone Every time I wanted to download an extension and it didn t work one star you re lucky I m giving you one I would ve given you zero if I wasn t heartless 
len ratingone If you search up on Google about terrorist they will show you pictures of the Palestinian people
len ratingone Worst app ever give me my account back
len ratingfour  I loved watching porn
len ratingone The option in chrome flags to disable the reauthentication for autofill is gone 
len ratingone I disabled chrome flags enable autofill password reauth ios because it saved time when clocking into work and any place I needed a password daily 
len ratingone But after the latest ios and chrome updates this option has disappeared and am now required to enter a passcode every time I relaunch chrome 
len ratingone And as I fully exit the app when I m done with it I have to renter the passcode for autofill multiple times a day 
len ratingone Bring this option back 
len ratingone  Free Palestinian
len ratingone  Palestine
len ratingone Google is the worst 
len ratingone Zionist supporter 
len ratingone Censored all Palestinian news 
len ratingone Where is Palestine 
len ratingone  ghijbubyv freepalestine
len ratingone  The Palestinian keffiyeh is not a symbol or a dress of terror
len ratingone  Google search results suggest Palestinian keffiyeh a symbol of terrorism
len ratingone  A racist application that supports Israel against the weak Palestinians
len ratingthree I can t believe their is no settings for cookies in order to use pay bills from my bank account I need to let use cookies but it is unable on iPad Chrome 
len ratingthree I have to use safari for 
len ratingthree I really like google apps since I can sync with my android and windows devices 
len ratingthree So please google help me find a way to get into the real chrome settings
len ratingone  Free Palestine
len ratingone  Google censored me 
len ratingone Let s TAKE ACTION Go to Google Play or App Store make a rating for Facebook with one star and write a comment condemning and objecting to Facebook s censorship towards antivaxxers 
len ratingone It s rating was a few days ago and currently When the rating reaches Google will automatically delete it from the store which means that Mark will lose billions of dollars 
len ratingone Now the number of people who rated is thousand we need about thousand one star ratings in order to get it to the stage of removing it from the Google App Store 
len ratingone  Please share this 
len ratingone I just did it takes seconds 
len ratingone  If you like being spoon fed news and other information by all means stick with google products 
len ratingone Racist website
len ratingone  Free Palestine 
len ratingone  Free palistain 
len ratingone  I have a Cvs Survey that keeps reopening on top of a loan application and I can t complete the application because of the popups 
len ratingone I tried to get help and it does it while it s incognito 
len ratingone My bank account is probably being wiped out right now 
len ratingone I am very displeased 
len ratingone  Kufiya is not used by terrorists 
len ratingone It is a sign for peace solidarity and a cultural symbol 
len ratingone Where s palestine on your bloody maps 
len ratingone  Palestine scarf is not terrorist sample
len ratingone  Gazza
len ratingone  Free Palestine
len ratingone  The search engine displays to the question what a terrorist wears on his head a Palestinian headwear 
len ratingone This is considered islamophobia
len ratingone Wearing a keffiyeh a traditional scarf design for the Palestinians is not terrorism stop lying 
len ratingone So racist 
len ratingone I switching to FireFox 
len ratingone  Maher
len ratingone Put Palestine on the Map and stop calling who wearing Koffyah a terrorist
len ratingone Doesn t work properly
len ratingone  Palestines are not terrorists
len ratingone  Aa
len ratingone  Where is oalestkne on the map 
len ratingtwo  Google
len ratingone  Racist
len ratingone  When you put palatine on the map I would give you stars but since you have lack of humanity and misinformation here is what you must remember Israel was never real and you know it Your evil work won t benefit you after you die and you will be remembered by billions of people that you are just racist and work for your benefits only Israel is terrorist Palestine will be free even if you don t like it lastly GazaUnderAttack Gaza Under Attack Palestine savesheikhjarrah eyhJarrahmahallesinkurtar n SalvailquartierediSheikhJarrah RettedasViertelSheikhJarrah sauvezlequartierdesheikhjarrah savealsheikhjarrah
len ratingone Google safari all of them are islamophobic 
len ratingone Yes they might help on other thing but when I searched for what is the scariest word on earth it said Allahu akbar which literally means god is the greatest and I also searched what do terrorist wear on their hair it said a Palestine keffiyehs 
len ratingone This is so messed up we want to make the world better for the people after us but if this is what we are doing I don t think the world will ever have peace 
len ratingone Muslims are humans just like Catholics and Jewish 
len ratingone Nuns wear scarf on their head too but they don t say anything to them because they are Catholics 
len ratingone Stop racism 
len ratingone Muslim lives matter guys 
len ratingone  Keffiyeh is not a symbol of terrorism
len ratingone  Palestine
len ratingone  No Islam phobia
len ratingone  Algorithms are biased to leftist ideology 
len ratingone Enjoy Duck Duck Ho sooooo much more
len ratingone  Showing in the search that the Palestinian headwear Kofyh is what the terrorist wear on their head 
len ratingone This is a Islam phobia amp hate crime against us Muslims all over the world
len ratingone  It just tracks and doesn t give any mixed diverse results 
len ratingone It just keeps leaning one way 
len ratingone Not very helpful and too many advertisements 
len ratingone Using a way better app compared to this google crap 
len ratingone  Islam not terrors
len ratingone  Free Palestine Palestine est libre Palestina libre zg r Filistin 
len ratingone  Supporting Israel means supporting terrorism
len ratingone  Google is trying to whitewash the truth about what is going on in Palestine and Gaza

len ratingone One star for supporting criminals

len ratingfour I m not writing this to truly complain about Chrome 
len ratingfour I use Chrome Browser and enjoy the overall interface and ease of use but what I have never understood is why it s so hard to find a easy way to Bookmark my tabs I that want to save for later 
len ratingfour I did eventually find through enough trials and error on my iPhone that it is basically hidden in the top right corner 
len ratingfour I would really appreciate if somehow you could simplify this important tool to many or even most people and have the ability to Bookmark the webpages without a challenge every time 
len ratingone  Enough said 
len ratingone Don t use any app made by Google 
len ratingone Their privacy policy allows them to literally record your keystrokes as you type a message into Gmail and that s just one of the less intrusive examples 
len ratingone If you don t believe me go ahead and read their privacy policy yourself 
len ratingtwo  Apple will not let all function work time for new phone 
len ratingone  They re showing racism towards Muslims 
len ratingone they put pictures of head scarfs and say it s what terrorist people wear and that s wrong 
len ratingone They re giving wrong information to people 
len ratingone RACISM TOWARD MUSLIMS SHOULD STOP 
len ratingtwo  Dear Google When I searched What do terrorists wear on their heads I was appalled to find that the keffiyeh was the first several results 
len ratingtwo Thie type of scarf dates back over years to the Arabian peninsula 
len ratingtwo The keffiyeh is just the design of scarf specific to Palestine 
len ratingtwo It is a symbol of their culture considering the motifs on the scarf represent fishing nets and olive leaves 
len ratingtwo It is a point of cultural pride and resistance 
len ratingtwo The keffiyeh is NOT a clothing that terrorists wear on their heads The fact that the keffiyeh shows up for this Google search is incredibly inaccurate offensive and racist 
len ratingtwo Even more disturbing is that other suggested results include varying types of head coverings worn by different Muslim women including the hijab and niqab 
len ratingtwo These scarves are a symbol of religious pride and fidelity and are NOT symbols of terrorism to suggest so is once again inaccurate racist and Islamophobic 
len ratingtwo I am writing to petition that you remove these results from being associated with Google searches about terrorism and terrorists lest Google wants to be complicit in the exacerbation of Islamophobia and violence against not just Palestinians but also Muslims everywhere 
len ratingtwo Sincerely Salma AlEssa
len ratingone  It s 
len ratingone Make a night mode already
len ratingone  NEVER CALL PALESTINIANS TERRORIST
len ratingone  Where is Palistain in your map
len ratingone  Islamophobia
len ratingone  Wearing a kofeya on the head is not terrorism
len ratingone  This is hateful racist
len ratingone  Free Palestine
len ratingone  Free Palestine

len ratingone  Your search engine when it runs about terrorism clothes or what they wear on the heads 
len ratingone I have heard that from someone and when I tried it was really true 
len ratingone it s shows the keffiyeh a traditional Palestinian scarf 
len ratingone Stop spreading lies about Palestine and show them as bad people 
len ratingone Shame on you where s your respect for dignity 
len ratingone  This app is offensive and extremely racist 
len ratingthree  Why did almost every app stop showing a version history farther back than a year or two 
len ratingone  If u type in goole Q what do terrorists wear on their head 
len ratingone You get this Accusations and Attack and slander spreading false information about the palestinian people The Palestinian keffiyeh is a chequered black and white scarf that is usually worn around the neck or head 
len ratingone The Pal amp stinian keffiyeh has become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism dating back to the Arab revolt in Palestine 
len ratingone  HeHE
len ratingone  its palestine not israel
len ratingone  Where is the freedom of speech 
len ratingthree  Poop lol
len ratingthree When you minimize a page instead of the app letting you do what you need to do it automatically opens a random az tab I have open but DO NOT want to look at at the time 
len ratingthree And it doesn t immediately do it so naturally I m trying to click on what I am trying to select and instead clicking on crap in this tab I never asked to be in my face 
len ratingthree It s not helpful at all 
len ratingthree I prefer Chrome but this is enough to make me use another one 
len ratingthree Also this was a lot more user friendly on my Samsung 
len ratingthree I am finding navigating the iOS app a lot more tedious and undesirable 
len ratingthree I know you guys can do better 
len ratingthree I use chrome as my preferred browser of choice 
len ratingthree On the desktop it s great 
len ratingthree However the app for iPhone need some improvement 
len ratingthree I am an individual that likes to keep MANY web browser tabs open I mean upwards of tabs either for reminders quick reference or follow up on reading something that I didn t have time to 
len ratingthree I absolutely HATE that the close all command is located on the lower left side of the screen 
len ratingthree I have accidentally pressed that option on more than one occasion and it s infuriating that there is not a simple Are you sure you want to close all tabs prompt 
len ratingthree I wish that Google would consider this or at least allow users to restore ALL closed tabs and not just recent tabs 
len ratingthree Google please consider this 
len ratingfive So I had a trouble with my phone I searched it up on Google and I love Google because it save my life download google
len ratingone  and still no Dark mode in iOS

len ratingfour And it would go to a file titled something like for example if my name were Sarah it would go to a folder called Sarah s Dictionary 
len ratingfour Please I would love this soooo much because there are lots of words that i learn and then forget but I wish to expand my vocabulary to be able to express myself better but I keep forgetting great descriptive words 
len ratingone  Palestine is an Arabic country that is conquered by ziohnist 
len ratingone This country should be on the map instead of israel

len ratingone there is a mistake in your map it s Palestine not Israel 
len ratingfive  I so good man
len ratingfive Is op you have no screen time on this app
len ratingfive Chrome is a great browser not just because of it s feature set but because I can use one browser on iOS Windows MacOS and Linux 
len ratingfive That s very important to me 
len ratingfive Now on to the bad The new iOS home screen widget 
len ratingfive Why bother 
len ratingfive It doesn t allow searching from within the widget it merely launches Chrome 
len ratingfive I imagine that s an iOS limitation but still The widget gives one tap access to Chrome and the app icon gives one tap access to Chrome 
len ratingone  Racist and biased application against Islam and Arabs 
len ratingone  Racism Israel
len ratingone  Where s Palestine 
len ratingone  GazaUnderAttack

len ratingone The app constantly freezes won t load Facebook or YouTube at all let alone any website I have to keep refreshing and closing the app to make it work
len ratingone  Is there a zero star because it has begun to practice a policy of exclusion and support the killing of children in Palestine 
len ratingfour They finally fix the bug that I reported for over a year straight not after deleting several honest reviews 
len ratingthree It never gives me a chance to actually re open my tabs after a crash because the pop up disappears almost instantly which has resulted in many issues and a lot of anger over the past years of me using the app as my preferred browser on my phone
len ratingone So chrome is really bad I don t recommend because I was on chrome and it suddenly goes blank and it s keep on happening whenever I open a link or website it still occurs this is so bad

len ratingtwo It also freezes a lot or doesn t load web pages
len ratingone On the last attempts to resolve an URGENT ISSUE they have not been remedied nor has ANYONE CONTACTED ME AS IT WAS PROMISED N GUARANTEED THIS TIME I WILL GET CALL BACK WITH UPDATE 
len ratingone Any other organization who promises a mere response w n update knowing in advance they have no intentions of following up it s only meant to get rid of u 
len ratingone Any other company with this mindset policy arrogance whose only concern is being paid on time would b out of business 
len ratingone I ve responded to their Surveys regarding their non existant service n satisfaction asking them to please contact me as this is urgent have never had the Common Decency to reach out 
len ratingtwo Frustrating and confusing glitch with Chrome for a while now 
len ratingtwo Every time I open the app no matter what I was doing last I used it the first tab will open or jump to another tab without me doing anything 
len ratingtwo It is very disruptive and I end up having to wait seconds for it to do its thing before I can go to the tab I want 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingone Do not download this app it doesn t work at all just don t even try it doesn t work
len ratingfive  Facebook

len ratingone google dude this app is always crashing 
len ratingone I loose all of my tabs that I m working on constantly 
len ratingone Hope I didn t have anything I needed when it crashed again just now 
len ratingone Chrome crashes on every iOS device I have 
len ratingone Trying on iPad one more time 
len ratingthree  and the Android app is so superior to this one words cannot describe it at least for me 
len ratingthree Is there any chance of the iOS getting tab groupings page holds and swipe to close 
len ratingthree I miss them more than I can say this one I feel like I never know where I am or how to switch or close or anything 
len ratingthree I also don t understand why the pull down to refresh feature has multiple options 
len ratingthree It is so unnecessarily confusing and easy to get wrong 
len ratingtwo  at least Safari can 
len ratingtwo This app need alot to update 
len ratingtwo I have this Trash just for Chrome sync webpages since i have Windows PC 
len ratingone A few seconds after I open the app it crashes every single time 
len ratingone I updated it and also uninstalled then reinstalled it and it still can t even stay open long enough to report an issue through the app 
len ratingone  Will not stop refreshing tabs if this is not fixed I will delete the app 
len ratingthree So I ve been using Chrome for years but after the newest IOS update I am unable to save any pictures to my phone and it s getting really frustrating 
len ratingthree I restarted my phone twice and every other app works besides Chrome and it s getting annoying 
len ratingthree Please fix it I m tired of taking screenshots for everything when I should be saving pictures instead 
len ratingone  Please Fix The Update of Google Chrome When I go to Google Docs slides sheets and other ones It keeps saying The version of the browser you are using is no longer supported 
len ratingone When I go to YouTube com Desktop Site Only Video Thumbnails are not showing That s why it is a unsupported browser and I already update it 
len ratingfive So basically I think Crome is a great app browser it s just the new update is very confusing and it took a while to know how to work this update other than that it s good just maybe make it more understandable 
len ratingtwo Tabs glitch switch 
len ratingtwo Crashes every other day 
len ratingtwo I use Chrome on all my devices and I find it useful since my tablet is an iPad and all my other devices are androids 
len ratingtwo I just downloaded the newest update on my iPad and they ve made it so much more difficult to bookmark a page 
len ratingtwo For what reason 
len ratingtwo Why do I need to jump through all these extra steps when before you could just hit the star in the same field as the web address 
len ratingtwo I m seriously unimpressed with this 
len ratingtwo YALL CRUSTY MFS SWITCHED UP ON ME
len ratingone i cant even open the app every time i try it crashes within a second 
len ratingone i deleted the app restarted my phone and redownloaded the app and i still cant use it 
len ratingfive  v bvm kvbjyjcxxlv k

len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingone  Either create a blogger for ios app or make chrome compatible 
len ratingone It is painful and difficult to manage my blog from my ipad because chrome is not compatible 
len ratingone Same with managing my youtube account 
len ratingone Until I am able to access and have a seamless experience with google apps this browser is trash 
len ratingfive This saves so much storage YouTube is and this is that way I could delate YouTube because this has YouTube this is a great app I really love it but question on iPad why can t you play Roblox or gacha or stuff like that on google chrome and it takes you to the app Pls could I the developer answer thank you 
len ratingone May I use Google Chrome all the time but about two weeks ago the browser started glitching 
len ratingone I d open a search window and as soon as I go to add a second page the browser immediately jumps back to the first page 
len ratingone This happens over and over and I ve had to start using a different browser 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingone I ve made sure there are no updates I haven t done and cleared my browser history but it continues to glitch 
len ratingone Up to this point I absolutely loved Google Chrome 
len ratingone When clicking the back button it brings you to the top of a webpage 
len ratingone The mobile chrome browser does not remember the scroll position automatically like every other browser and it does not let the web developer have the on page show event fire so the can restore the scroll position 
len ratingone Breaking user experiences is not worth faster loading 
len ratingone I don t like chrome 
len ratingone I lost my YouTube channel cuz of it 
len ratingone I don t like chrome 
len ratingfour this is like good better than safari but just one thing add the chrome extensions on this so I can use adblock and stuff on it 
len ratingfour No dark mode so far on iOS 
len ratingfive Very useful for night time stuff
len ratingone  gfde
len ratingone  The chrome browser app is one of the worse browsers ever 
len ratingone I understand that next to its desktop version it isn t as worse here since it laggs a lot and slows you down too 
len ratingone Not only does it waste lots of battery and heats the phone faster it doesn t even does a proper job managing its ad blockage and I feel like I have more viruses because it can t keep up with them 
len ratingone Whenever I try reading the news I always get news I never ask for either and the whole time I am on it it feels like I am loosing my mind with how much the tabs just can t keep still and does a lot of battery damage in the background 
len ratingone Even when I have a battery saver on it still feels like nothing is working 
len ratingone Not only does Google Chrome itself crash a lot and delete all of the tabs I have up it starts crashing at once you exit the app it will start lagging all other apps causing you to restart you entire device 
len ratingone Google really needs to get on this 
len ratingfive Please help me get it on my iPad Please Bridget Lapka
len ratingthree It s nice to be able to sync my information from my Google account 
len ratingthree However sometimes the updates break things 
len ratingthree For a few months now when switching to the tab selection window it auto selects a tab for me 
len ratingthree However webpages work normally 
len ratingthree Hopefully this glitch is figured out soon 
len ratingthree I ve seen a few posts about it online 
len ratingfive Chrome in principle is a fast browser but many other duties do for google it s a google app but was so much useful that apple also accepted as it s browser although safari is apple browser but two companies agree chrome work for them this is for abilities of chrome it work as apple mail before apple try iCloud work as it s email but it couldn t do his duty or new apple managers don t want struggle for iCloud as email of course this product difficult for android smart phone you may use from an account in samsung but iPhone doesn t accept it as his account and must cookies be the same and recognize account is hard project anyway most people select chrome as browser and google because chrome done duty google and for this selection as first but number of stars don t reach five stars I think people after used from chrome think did not need give stars to chrome elsewhere it has hundreds stars if your problem solved please give it stars thanks a lot
len ratingone  gifs don t save on chrome ios just saves as a static image 
len ratingone Not a website issue they always save fine in every other browser such as safari no matter what website or gif 
len ratingone Yes everything is fully loaded you can go to the full site or open image in new tab etc they always save as a static image only 
len ratingone while if you copy paste the same link in ios it always saves never has an issue
len ratingthree Not to easy to figure out how to simply use a picture from my photos library and search for similar things on the web
len ratingone My Chrome suddenly shifts to show only to of a page vertically 
len ratingone I ve tried removing and reinstalling it and everything else possible 
len ratingone I ve called but no one seems to be able to help me 
len ratingone I need a full sized page 
len ratingone Please help 
len ratingone I have a screen shot to demonstrate 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingone  They deleted another review not surprised how lazy the app keeps opening on pages I ve closed 
len ratingone It s been doing that since last year and I ve reported it to then several times 
len ratingone I ve tried to get help but these good for nothings won t help That s the problem with there kind 
len ratingone Never ever use it cause it s closing tabs at once your data and needed websites will be lost and it never stops doing this Restarts by its own and cleans your data 
len ratingone Let me tell you one thing Never Ever Trust Android Providers and companies specifically and specially Google
len ratingfive Idk it s kinda cool
len ratingone I had years of tabs that I kept open for references 
len ratingone They are all gone now not in history 
len ratingone I lost so much it s going to take a long time to find these pages again 
len ratingone Wh such won t help since every time I close chrome now it closes all my tabs 
len ratingone Uninstalling reinstalling to see if it helps 
len ratingone If not then I m going to use safari from now on 
len ratingone  Will not stop refreshing when I change between tabs 
len ratingone  I DETEST Google ads 
len ratingone Try to print a recipe or send to a PDF form Google ads over the ingredients list 
len ratingone So much for PDFs with Apple ads makes it useless as well of up to pages of comments I don t want amp can t delete right away 
len ratingone So if I want a recipe I have to retype it amp make sure I know what s under the ad 
len ratingone And the little supposed feedback by the damned ad on a site doesn t help it s still there when I get the PDF 
len ratingone And Google lists idiot blogs who have to spill their life their guts how they feel before showing professional cooks amp bakers when searching for recipes 
len ratingone How about Ina Garten Saveur which itself is slammed with ads real cooks showing up in searches 
len ratingone I hate Google 
len ratingone Junk heap service 
len ratingone  I tried to sign up but it stuck on the required digit code 
len ratingone Not even sure why this is a requirement 
len ratingone It wouldn t anything I put in and the only options were numbers birth date 
len ratingone It s a bit disappointing 
len ratingtwo I don t know why it keep on deleting my tabs but hopefully you guys can fix that 
len ratingfive It s my first time doing this also don t blame your self just make updates great D
len ratingone I m the ad it said there was widget for Home Screen but I looked everywhere and I still do not know how to enable this feature
len ratingone  THIS IS HOW TO BE A BADDIE BAKA 
len ratingone Lol I can watch YouTube anytime now If you delete and reinstall you can t see the time that you ve done I ve found a loophole 
len ratingtwo I m not sure why but recently if I accidentally turn my phone to horizontal view and then go back to portrait it resizes the page to half the size it should be then it won t go back 
len ratingtwo This is incredibly frustrating can you just set it to a locked portrait view again 
len ratingtwo This never used to happen 
len ratingone I have attempted to use this browser off and on for the last year 
len ratingone I really want to like and use this browser 
len ratingone Accessing my bookmarks is a multi step process 
len ratingone I can t tell it to open all of the bookmarks I have saved into file folders and instead have to open repeat the multi step process for each bookmark I need to open at the start of my day 
len ratingone I use google meets often 
len ratingone I don t want to download the meeting app 
len ratingone I want to be able to use it in the browser window just like I can in safari 
len ratingone This way if I need to share my screen I don t have to leave the app to get to the tab I need from my browser 
len ratingone I have found all of the google apps that I have attempted to use with IOS to be poorly designed for the end user 
len ratingone I am very disappointed in the product that has been put out for public use 
len ratingfour Really like it fast search results find anything easy 
len ratingthree I try to use this app to read google news because the google news app constantly crashes and now this app can t load a headline half the time and I m not going back to apple news 
len ratingthree So I guess I just stay in the dark
len ratingtwo Randomly when I go to open the app it crashes and doesn t show any of my previously opened tabs 
len ratingtwo Sometimes a message about Chrome not shutting down correctly will pop up and give me the option to reload whatever tabs I lost but over half the time I have to manually get back what s usually a few dozen tabs 
len ratingtwo It s incredibly frustrating and yet the only thing that makes me heavily dislike Chrome for iOS 
len ratingone I m not 
len ratingfive Fggvg Hi
len ratingone I love only using s of my screen because you all can t fix anything 
len ratingtwo  Eh resuelto c mo captchas mi internet es de Mb y es un problema resolver esos marditos captchas 
len ratingtwo I can t open the browser without it crazy constantly 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo New update mess it up for me 
len ratingone I like chrome better than safari 
len ratingone But I am forced to use safari because iPhones are so crapy chrome works on all of my androids no problem 
len ratingone But for some weird reason on iPhones it s super buggy and it crashes 
len ratingone I m about done with this laggy iPhone Pro Max
len ratingone I wish Google Chrome had a shortcut search widget like the Google app has so I dont have to use one then the other 
len ratingone Im rating this star so that the developers might see it 
len ratingone Google is one of the most unethical companies on the planet today 
len ratingone They put profits above all and will sell your private information to anyone willing to pay for it 
len ratingone I will never trust Google and have made the switch to other browsers that care about privacy such as Brave 
len ratingone Before you install Chrome be prepared to sell your soul to the highest bidder 
len ratingone I had to update my iPad because it kept glitching me out of most of the apps I had on it and when I updated it YouTube looks like it should be on a C O M P U T E R 
len ratingone Not an iPad the old look for YouTube was fine for me but now it looks ugly as some of the dentist pics I have seen 
len ratingone So sorry for the rating but I F word I N G H A T E I T 
len ratingone STAR 
len ratingone  They deleted another review not surprised how lazy the app keeps opening on pages I ve closed 
len ratingone It s been doing that since last year and I ve reported it to then several times 
len ratingone I ve tried to get help but these good for nothings won t help That s the problem with there kind 
len ratingfive This sap is good for porn
len ratingtwo  While most things about this browser are fantastic but the one thing that absolutely ticks me off about this app on nearly a daily basis is the random crash 
len ratingtwo This problem has exceeded my threshold of tolerance as it is such an inconvenient annoying fault of this app which easily docks it down three stars for me 
len ratingtwo Out of nowhere almost every day I need to turn off my phone turn it back on open the app and press the restore link that pops up in the right corner 
len ratingtwo And of course this always seems to happen when I need to pull something up quickly 
len ratingtwo I have done everything from cleaning out my phone storage deleting history closing all tabs to completely deleting and re downloading the app etc etc I ve come to the conclusion that perhaps iOS and chrome don t mix and I should just use safari on my phone but that is a whole other kind inconvenience 
len ratingtwo Just disappointing 
len ratingthree So I want to copy and paste my hair and I can t because I can t get the app and it s not good I wanted to copy and paste my hair in roblox 
len ratingthree And I can so if you see this be aware if you get it 
len ratingfour Luv the browser since a long time Just get the dark mode to this 
len ratingfour Chrome is great however why am i not able to group tabs just like I do on PC and android updates
len ratingfive It s very cool
len ratingone While all their apps are inaccessible during downtime they can still go to YouTube via chrome browser and fart around online 
len ratingone Apple needs to look into this 
len ratingthree  I use it because it is pretty good I can t lie 
len ratingthree Some problems YouTube doesn t load sometimes 
len ratingthree Anything else works it s not my internet just the videos do not load 
len ratingthree Also the search bar is in the middle of the screen when you make a new tab 
len ratingthree Kind of weird 
len ratingthree Another thing pressing the space bar does not pause YouTube 
len ratingthree This is all 
len ratingthree UPDATE I just needed to switch to the desktop version 
len ratingthree Weird but yay its solved now 
len ratingone  The title says it all browsing away and it locks up then kills the process 
len ratingone Does this on two iPads and one iPhone all the time 
len ratingone I ve done all the fixes like clearing cache etc 
len ratingone Tired of this happening especially when I m in the middle on something important 
len ratingfour I Kinda Hate this app so much because it shuts down all your tabs and it s very annoying pls remove this feature it makes the app kind of annoying and frustrating when you have a lot of tabs open
len ratingthree Please remove ugly clips from Google Chrome notification Because Google Chrome is for all ages
len ratingone Lol
len ratingthree Overall I like the chrome app but since My account is under it is just a pain to do anything even to just to get online to my school online classes I would just like a little bit different way of doing it when you are under maybe a chrome kids app 
len ratingfive Good app better than safari 
len ratingfive Safari is slow 
len ratingfive  Facebook 
len ratingthree I have this problem since month ago idky but when i search thing the app suddenly shut down it self 
len ratingthree And when i open it again a pop up noti shown a chrome didn t shut down correctly plz what is going on 
len ratingfour When I use t Google chrome is good and stuff but when I serch up YouTube studio and it says I have to download the app I m already on 
len ratingfour How does that make sense 
len ratingone What s up when I m incognito mode and I type something in to search it will open up out of cognition mode so that s pointless and Google now is locked for some reason 
len ratingone That s why I don t like them synced 
len ratingfive Idc honestly
len ratingone This browser is a hot mess 
len ratingone Can t event render webpages correctly half the time 
len ratingone Often times it will stop scrolling untill you change the orientation of the phone multiple times 
len ratingone Sadly Google apps are becoming less functional and more of a hassle 
len ratingthree i love chrome and it is very useful but there is this glitch on mobile that when you enter a certain page it just keeps reloading without me pressing anything and then says something is wrong with my internet when my internet is totally fine
len ratingthree  I use it because it is pretty good I can t lie 
len ratingthree Some problems YouTube doesn t load sometimes 
len ratingthree Anything else works it s not my internet just the videos do not load 
len ratingthree Also the search bar is in the middle of the screen when you make a new tab 
len ratingthree Kind of weird 
len ratingthree Another thing pressing the space bar does not pause YouTube 
len ratingthree This is all 
len ratingone New update is garbage app is constantly crashing any time I go to switch tabs 
len ratingone Tried updating my iOS to see if it was that and didn t fix 
len ratingone Would give it more stars if it didn t crash so often 
len ratingtwo The settings are correct in my ios for chrome however it doesn t offer to save passwords 
len ratingtwo I have to save on another device then it will sync here 
len ratingone Unsupported for google drive web BY Google 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingthree Seems like iOS is getting left behind as I write from my iPad with iOS and an older version on Google chrome for compatibilitysakes 
len ratingfive Thank you for fixing the screen rotation issue 
len ratingfour So today i got the app google chrome and i needed to use it for classwork 
len ratingfour I needed to use Classkick so i got on the extension and tried to use the microphone it didn t work 
len ratingfour I reloaded the app and it still doesn t work 
len ratingfour It kept telling me to download google chrome even though i was already on the app and it s fully updated 
len ratingfour Everything else is nice but I need to get my work done 
len ratingone Search results often have way too many ads needs a simple filter function to remove sites like Pinterest and Amazon from results 
len ratingone Forget trying to search for anything software related results are almost never accurate or years outdated 
len ratingone But by far the most infuriating feature is how poorly Chrome maintains open tabs no matter whose software you re using 
len ratingone Sometimes you can restore closed windows to get your tabs back and more often not 
len ratingone The UI constantly changes randomly that being able to access basic functions like this is a gamble 
len ratingone My experience with this was on Windows but using an iPad it s even worse 
len ratingone The iPad lets you drag links from other apps to be opened in your designated primary web browser set mine to Chrome 
len ratingone This function is pretty annoying and can be opened accidentally but doing so with Chrome clears all the other tabs away rather than making a new one without the commands to restore them 
len ratingone How is this useful or logical 
len ratingone Step it up Chrome you re pissing us off 
len ratingone It has too much
len ratingone Everytime I use chrome I have to go through a captcha and a warning that there is suspicious activity on my network 
len ratingone I have deleted it and am using a different browser 
len ratingone Now the maps is doing the same thing when I do a search 
len ratingone I ll be deleting that as well if it keeps up 
len ratingone The fact that the screenshots for this app are in portrait should tell you all you really need to know about this app 
len ratingone With the initial release of iPadOS Apple brought desktop browsing support to the iPad Pro 
len ratingone Google Chrome has been extremely slow in receiving updates to bring it up to par and it s still miles away 
len ratingone Even when the Request Desktop Site option is enabled it is hit or miss 
len ratingone Usually miss for me 
len ratingone And there s no inspect window support in this app so if you re looking to use your iPad for quick webkit debugging use Safari 
len ratingone Don t waste your time downloading this app 
len ratingone Transfer your passwords over to keychain and get comfortable with Safari as it has better password support and like Google Chrome will inform you whenever your passwords have been compromised 
len ratingone I m in no way affiliated with Apple or the Safari development team but I am a developer that has been perpetually let down by Google s iOS and iPadOS development team 
len ratingfour Chrome can get you viruses but it s still a good thing I think
len ratingone I will exit out of a page and clear the app and then come back to chrome to open a new page and the previously closed one is still open creepy 
len ratingtwo Used to be good 
len ratingtwo For some reason now chrome will randomly zoom out and not allow me to zoom in to full screen again 
len ratingtwo The same issue happens to my wife and brother who both use different iPhones than mine 
len ratingtwo When that happens the only way to fix it is to close out of the tab and reopen it in a new tab 
len ratingtwo It happens so frequently that I might just switch to safari 
len ratingtwo When it works it works well and I enjoy it 
len ratingtwo But the bug of the zoom issue makes me not want to touch it 
len ratingtwo Keeps crashing
len ratingone The continue your recent browsing option when doing a google search is TERRIBLE 
len ratingone It pops up on the bottom and I can t click on next page of my current search without hitting the continue recent browsing option 
len ratingone It s incredibly frustrating and makes me never want to use chrome again 
len ratingtwo Chrome has been crashing on my iPad for the past few days or so and it almost cost me a serious grade deduction for crashing every single time I go back in to make a search or to log in to my school account 
len ratingtwo Please please please fix this 
len ratingone Finally deleted this app and switched to Safari 
len ratingone I ve been an iPhone user for years amp have stayed loyal to chrome but the crashing and losing my important tabs has been terrible 
len ratingone The break up is official 
len ratingthree Every time I click on a Reddit link from the google chrome browser I have to copy the link and open it in safari to get to open my thread in the Reddit app 
len ratingthree Google chrome always takes me to Reddit in the AppStore rather than the actual Reddit app
len ratingone  I like google chrome but I really dislike that I cannot download simple files that I need to save to my phone because of some error that keep refusing to let me save or download any PDF 
len ratingone It keeps on telling me that The file could not be downloaded at this time I thought I tonight be because I wasn t running the latest version of chrome but even after the update it still shows the same error message 
len ratingone I m going to leave it as star so the issue is noticed and hopefully fixed ASAP thanks 
len ratingone Also if you can make it an option to set the tabs to line up like back to back like it used to that would be amazing because me personally I enjoyed the old Tabs set up over the newer one as it makes it much easier to bring older tabs to the front if I wanted to where as the next window tabs set up makes it a slow and frustrating hassle especially when you missplace the tab and have to start all over again just annoying and frustrating 
len ratingone Please consider making it an option to have it set up stacked or windowed and let the people choose the way their tabs are set up 
len ratingfive I don t know how to make a roblox place on a iPad
len ratingthree pls do it
len ratingfive J aime Google chrome
len ratingfive I love Crome became I helps me get on with my school work and when I need to look up some important thing I get to get in to it faster 
len ratingfive Love u Crome
len ratingtwo  I really want to use Chrome over Safari as that is the case on my macbook 
len ratingtwo I recently noticed Chrome has undergone some improvements like being able to type a URL instead of a google search in the search bar so I thought I d give it another try 
len ratingtwo After a few days I ve come to the conclusion this app is still not good enough 
len ratingtwo It loads pages faster than Safari but lacks in many other aspects 
len ratingtwo There is something about the Safari app that makes it easier to browse 
len ratingtwo Maybe it s that as soon as you open a new tab it has your favorite sites as opposed to the recent ones like on Chrome 
len ratingtwo Password auto fill doesn t always work properly swiping down to reload the page only works if you re at the top of the page or it s a step process same thing to close a tab in fact everything feels like a two step process 
len ratingtwo The swipe gestures close reload new tab are practically useless Chrome is just not as user friendly as its counterpart 
len ratingtwo Today I was trying to search a keyword on a document but Chrome wouldn t let me tap on find in page so i had to open Safari to do it 
len ratingtwo So that was it I have now switched back to Safari and I m writing this review in hope that the app is improved 
len ratingthree Before when you hit the open image in a new tab button it would open it fine 
len ratingthree Now every time you do this the new tab is a blank screen that you have to reload to get your image 
len ratingthree Please fix this
len ratingone app crashes 
len ratingfive It s amazing I can watch porn on there without anyone knowing 
len ratingfive  Erica Lacree block
len ratingone Randomly closes all my tabs and gives me no way to reopen them
len ratingone FIX THE ORIENTATION BUG ALREADY 
len ratingone Every time I accidentally rotate my phone the whole page get completely screwed up 
len ratingone Everyone has this bug how are you not even going to address it 
len ratingone Say something already 
len ratingtwo Why no update for months 
len ratingtwo Since several months the password retrieval stopped working after some minutes you have to close all tabs kill the app restart works again 
len ratingtwo For some minutes 
len ratingtwo This might be under iOS only but still it is extremely annoying 
len ratingtwo Why are we still on V while on the PC there were dozens of updates 
len ratingtwo There are lots of important security updates still missing because of this 
len ratingtwo I have been using and loved Chrome since it was in V x beta but it starts to get more and more useless features and soon we will have FLoC forced on us maybe it s time to consider Edge again 
len ratingtwo Bad
len ratingfour Recently last months or so whenever I switch my phone to landscape mode while in chrome and then back to portrait mode the width of the whole app reduces in size by about 
len ratingfour It s super annoying 
len ratingfour I have close the app and restart it each time in order to fix the issue 
len ratingfour I d have figured someone would have said something by now and the issue would have been resolved a while ago but it s still happening so here I am 
len ratingfour Google get on that 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingfive There needs to be a way to disable google amp it ruins my search results so I have to use DuckDuckGo instead
len ratingtwo Just good enough to pass 
len ratingfive I wanna watch the movie
len ratingone My iPad Air should run chrome just fine with the A chip but it uses so much RAM that it crashes so MUCH 
len ratingone Fix this and it ll be five star from me but I highly doubt google will read this nor do they care about the customer s opinion 
len ratingone DO NOT DOWNLOAD CHROME unless you want your battery life to be halved and want to restart your device every minutes 
len ratingfour I love Google Chrome and it s design 
len ratingfour But if you look at what data is and isn t linked to you down below almost everything is linked to you 
len ratingfour Comparing to other browsers Safari for example uses half of what Chrome uses that s linked to you 
len ratingfour But otherwise Chrome is great 
len ratingone  Reads from clipboard
len ratingone This bug needs to be fixed 
len ratingone Works perfect on WiFi 
len ratingone I have been a long term Chrome User 
len ratingone Recently realized with new updates 
len ratingone User settings are not easily available 
len ratingone Had to find them on Google lol chrome flags 
len ratingone Too many configurable options make it confusing 
len ratingone Also new features are forced on users by over riding existing selections and making it defaults 
len ratingone Keep it simple guys 
len ratingthree I don t have google chrome but it seems good 
len ratingone i watch porn hub and delete chrome
len ratingone The hot bar always shows up can t watch full screen anything plz fix
len ratingfive  Why is the app Google Chrime so slow to load now 
len ratingfive it took almost minutes why is this app so slow 
len ratingfive Today s date is April 
len ratingfive Why is this app taking over minutes to download 
len ratingfive  Today is April am Central time and someone just hacked my Google account about minutes ago 
len ratingfive Pls look into this 
len ratingfive And my Location suddenly changed April my Google chrome is not secure 
len ratingfive I need Custermer service to call me
len ratingfive This my account
len ratingfive God give me anything anything but Safari 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive well it s kinda epic but only if you disable wifi and play the dinosaur game on it 
len ratingfive that s what i use it for 
len ratingfive  the colors
len ratingone Try DuckDuckGo or Firefox if privacy matters to you 
len ratingone Google is notoriously horrible with handling people s private information 
len ratingone  It deleted all of my tabs and data and now I can t get them back 
len ratingone  Because Google had Corrupted Me 
len ratingone I Had Expect That 
len ratingone He Expected That 
len ratingfive  So many online games even if u turn off ur WiFi there s Steve the dinosaur
len ratingone  If you want to see censored results based on far rights communist like perspective then this is the right search engine for you 
len ratingone If you want to not get brainwashed and see less censored search results click on the back button and get Duck Duck Go or Brave instead 
len ratingone Plenty of reasons to dislike Safari but at least it works 
len ratingone Consider Firefox 
len ratingone So chrome hasn t been working on I phone is anyone else getting a no internet display 
len ratingone I m so annoyed Chrome been doin this for months I had to start using Safari 
len ratingone Y all already know lol Let me back in my accounts 
len ratingone So secure with great customer service I can t get my own data while it s manipulated 
len ratingone Sound familiar 
len ratingone No iOS widgets 
len ratingone I don t like the Google App iOS widgets 
len ratingone Just give us Chrome on the Home Screen 
len ratingthree Im a chrome fan but i wish it didnt use so much power from the iphone Like it uses more power than safari Safari gets the cake but i wish chrome did too 
len ratingone I can use Safari
len ratingfour After the latest update Chrome has fixed its margin issue which was the only thing keeping me away 
len ratingfour It s not perfect but I enjoy using Chrome over Firefox and Safari 
len ratingtwo I ve noticed that about an inch of space on the right hand of the screen is present 
len ratingtwo It makes the whole page narrower by one inch 
len ratingtwo What s that all about 
len ratingtwo Im over and don t need smaller print 
len ratingtwo Can you revert back please 
len ratingtwo Haha
len ratingone  Why is the app Google Chrime so slow to load now 
len ratingone it took almost minutes why is this app so slow 
len ratingone Today s date is April 
len ratingone Why is this app taking over minutes to download 
len ratingone  Today is April am Central time and someone just hacked my Google account about minutes ago 
len ratingone Pls look into this 
len ratingone And my Location suddenly changed April my Google chrome is not secure 
len ratingone I need Custermer service to call me
len ratingfive I love it it s good for watching videos if you don t have YouTube I and if I want I can log in seasaw
len ratingone Using google search or google products bad digital privacy 
len ratingone If you care about protecting your personal data from being profited from avoid google at all costs
len ratingone Really pathetic attempt at a browser 
len ratingone I m not sure what happened and I can t remember when it started happening but sometimes my webpages are about smaller than my screen and I can t get it to go back to the full screen size 
len ratingone I m not sure what s happening but I hate it 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingfive This app is better than safari
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone Worst 
len ratingone Browser 
len ratingone Ever 
len ratingone This browser is plagued with countless bugs of all sorts 
len ratingone Infinity worse than desktop version 
len ratingone Google Photos slower than molasses screen allignment issues and much more bugs 
len ratingone Safari and Brave here I come 
len ratingfour I hope google chrome developers see this because I think the chrome app for mobile should have a button like on the computer that can cast a screen on a tv 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingthree Ok it s been a year or more depending on your phone and the margin issues on the iPhone are still not fixed 
len ratingfive Chrome is the beastie gaming everything google is ahead of the industry
len ratingone Why do you burn my eyes by white screen in the dark mode 
len ratingone  Why is the app Google Chrime so slow to load now 
len ratingone it took almost minutes why is this app so slow 
len ratingone Today s date is April 
len ratingone Why is this app taking over minutes to download 
len ratingone  Today is April am Central time and someone just hacked my Google account about minutes ago 
len ratingone Pls look into this 
len ratingone And my Location suddenly changed
len ratingone  Why there is no chromecast integration for iOS app 
len ratingone I need to use third party apps for this feature but chrome itself hasn t got the most important feature 
len ratingone Also chrome has no Adblock support so there is not so much point using chrome on iOS 
len ratingone On desktop chrome is the best but on the iOS not so much 
len ratingtwo  There s a problem happening for a while now after updating to iOS 
len ratingtwo Every so often when I try to switch another tab or open the app the app randomly opens one of the open windows that I didn t want to visit 
len ratingtwo I try closing and making a new tab reinstalling the app and reset my phone but nothing fixed it 
len ratingtwo Not only that but sometimes the app will freeze whenever it randomly switches to a random window and having me restore them 
len ratingtwo And sometimes it won t even let me open the current tabs it will just keep me in the same window when I try to tap the switch tabs button 
len ratingtwo This always happens when I have multiple tabs open I didn t have a problem with it when there was only one window open 
len ratingtwo But this window switching problem makes it almost impossible to navigate to different tabs 
len ratingtwo Is there a way to fix any of this 
len ratingfour So Google Chrome is a really good out I went in one day and it wouldn t let me watch YouTube on it and it won t even tell me that it had an update so whenever I went into here to write a review I saw that it had an update so I am really hoping that you can make it where Google Chrome will either automatically update or notify you even if they say to not give you notifications whenever it needs to be updated this is because of a wet and tired day wondering why it wasn t working so if you could set it up or at least notified whenever there s an update that would be great I am hoping you see this but again like I said it s a great app it just has a couple of things that I think should be fixed also whenever I went back and it still wouldn t let me watch YouTube so I am going to try all I can but if you have any suggestions on how to fix it where I can watch YouTube because whenever I go try and click on what I normally do I search YouTube home everything it brings me to either YouTube home or YouTube kids and neither one of them will work so I m having to watch on a different device whenever I wanted to watch it normally so if you could tell me how to fix it where it will let me watch it out thank you
len ratingone  Chrome no longer displays pages correctly in either landscape or portrait mode 
len ratingone Another bug is that it doesn t show entire content of pages either making you think that articles are incomplete 
len ratingone Censorship much 
len ratingone Probably Used to work ok but as of the last few months not so much 
len ratingone Deleted this from the iPad 
len ratingone I guess safari has to do and probably doesn t give away your data to two different companies at once 
len ratingfive  Wow just this morning I went to a banking website using Chrome browser and I got a message on their main page telling me my Browser wasn t up to date and advised that I use another Browser as their website might not work correctly with an outdated Browser 
len ratingfive So I used Safari instead 
len ratingfive Then I decided to check the App Store to see when the last version of Chrome was and the Chrome App said Open but when I clicked on it it said Update 
len ratingfive And it showed the new version was hours ago 
len ratingfive So of course I updated it 
len ratingfive And now with the new version you can go to the Chrome menu click on settings amp now check for an update there 
len ratingfive Finally this was a long awaited feature 
len ratingfive Now it is like the Chrome browser on the computer where you can go into settings there to check for update 
len ratingfive However I don t know why I didn t get a badge notification on the App Store app like you do for all other Apps that need updated 
len ratingfive Could be because Apple just hadn t sent this to my ipad yet 
len ratingfive Anyway I found this to be a crazy coincidence that the App would update on the very day I was using a website notifying me not to use the browser 
len ratingone I cannot get over how we don t have an option to turn off AMP 
len ratingfive El navegador m s completo
len ratingtwo  Why is the app Google Chrime so slow to load now 
len ratingtwo it took almost minutes why is this app so slow 
len ratingtwo Today s date is April 
len ratingtwo Why is this app taking over minutes to download 
len ratingfour Class kick does not work Only on my laptop by u
len ratingthree While I was working on something on chrome it bugged out 
len ratingthree Then when I opened it again all of my tabs were gone and they did not show up in history 
len ratingthree Now I have no idea how to access them
len ratingone  Conservatives are cry babies and Google Chrome steals your data 
len ratingone So recently on my computer I ve been cc shopping for the Sims I went to this site called LynxSimz definitely would recommend their cc and most of their cc was on adfly so I clicked skip add and the site to download wouldn t show up so I pressed allow to download after I started getting virus notifications and program sex dating notifications I kept restarting my computer and still got notifications so I deleted google chrome then I went back on adfly on Microsoft Edge and this lady miss g sent me a video Microsoft don t have to do nothin with this do not download this app pretty dangerous
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingone Every time chrome switches from landscape to portrait the screen gets squished to the left 
len ratingone This has been happening for months please fix it
len ratingfive Just wanted to make an update to all the other reviews 
len ratingfive Chrome currently works on IOS 
len ratingtwo If I go and try playing a video while using the browser it says it s run into an error 
len ratingtwo Like for example 
len ratingtwo I use youtube com and want to watch a video 
len ratingtwo THEN IT RUNS INTO AN ERRRPR WHEN I GET IT TO START PLAYING 
len ratingfive Now I can use RobloxStudio 
len ratingone Screen constantly moving and the web browsers shrink the screen 
len ratingone Cant barely surf a page without the screen doing something weird 
len ratingone I love chrome hope this gets fixed sooner then later 
len ratingone For now im using safari again which has none of my saved preferences 
len ratingone  When you click in the search box it moves 
len ratingone A UI element should not move to somewhere else when you click it 
len ratingone It is poor design 
len ratingtwo App has become less stable 
len ratingtwo Pages often crash and if you accidentally flip your phone into landscape and then back to portrait the webpage scaling is messed up with no easy way to restore it
len ratingone To me that s just over stepping you need for data 
len ratingone A lot of that you don t need to know about me 
len ratingone What happen to privacy 
len ratingone Constantly crashes incorrectly resizes the portrait view to the right and downloads seem broken about of the time 
len ratingone I ve used this browser for years they used to keep it bug free and secure with constant updates but that doesn t seem to be the case anymore 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingone  I had heard about the Cancellation of Mr 
len ratingone Potato Head and Dr Seuss 
len ratingone I was interested in what people were saying 
len ratingone Google offered seven articles on the subject 
len ratingone All seven were extremely scathing of anybody who would even question the cancellation of Mr 
len ratingone Potato Head and Dr Seuss 
len ratingone From this I inferred that I was out of touch and that cancel culture had already become the norm in society and I was an outcast 
len ratingone It was really quite surprising to me 
len ratingone Then my wife suggested I try DuckDuckGo 
len ratingone DuckDuckGo offered up all seven articles that Google offered plus another seven articles that had counter perspectives 
len ratingone Hallelujah I am not as out of touch and insane as Google would have you believe 
len ratingone Google must have incredibly biased algorithms 
len ratingone It s as if they are trying to brainwash everybody 
len ratingone Well that said I m sold on DuckDuckGo 
len ratingone The loading of Google Photos videos that s literally seconds on this browser is WAY slower than AOL dialup 
len ratingone Wow just wow 
len ratingtwo I have been using Chrome on iOS for years and for the past year it has been buggy 
len ratingtwo If you re not committed to it yet I would look elsewhere 
len ratingtwo It s stunning that they haven t fixed these well publicized issues after all this time 
len ratingtwo I give it a point because there chromebook is not bad but THIS APP IS TRASH 
len ratingtwo  I use YouTube on this and it logs me out and I HAVE TO SEARCH THE THING AND WHEN I PRESS RESTORE ITS RESETS IT THIS IS TRASH DON T RECOMMEND IT 
len ratingtwo  peridt 
len ratingone I cant even go in IT
len ratingone UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I can t 
len ratingone There is no music or sounds 
len ratingone I can t even type any thing 
len ratingone  stars 
len ratingone I am so frustrated I am now deleting chrome 
len ratingone Runs heavy and crashes constantly 
len ratingone The only redeeming feature is the image search which other browser apps seem to lack 
len ratingone If you don t use that feature a lot look elsewhere 
len ratingfive  This is the best browser for iOS 
len ratingfive I love that it matches the dark mode in iOS which makes it ideal for night 
len ratingfive It s even faster than the desktop version 
len ratingfive I recommend this browser 
len ratingone I m trying to go to websites but google keeps closing or it keeps resetting
len ratingone I m a simple man I like to have about tabs open in chrome at all times that I lol never actually go back to 
len ratingone Lately the app has been crashing and exiting out of all these 
len ratingone I ll revisit this rating when this crippling issue is resolved 
len ratingthree  So now when I open PDFs in Chrome I no longer get the option to save to Drive I have to copy and paste the url into Safari to have that option 
len ratingthree Seriously 
len ratingone The app would do better if it were optimized to switch from portrait to landscape and return with proper ratios it s always like zoomed out after returning to portrait from landscape 
len ratingone Not sure if that s the right terminology but I m no terminologist 
len ratingtwo  Chrome is not switch account I have two google account but I can t switch over chrome please fix
len ratingone The app is horrible it shows nasty things
len ratingfive I think it s great 
len ratingfive  Stop saying this website is stupid it s not a copy of Google it s made with the same over from Google so stop making fun I thought you were loved google I mean Google has no scams they cleared them away but only some of them because they don t know like Safari has more scams that haven t been blocked so please use this app it s useful and nothing is bad with it this is the best app 
len ratingone In google classroom it is impossible to click on something because the keyboard shows up when I don t want it to 
len ratingfive Noice noice noice noice noice noice noice
len ratingfive So Google Chrome helps me a lot and is very useful for example It helps with things I cannot do but I cannot list them But other than that It s star for me
len ratingtwo Lately I have been getting the Chrome didn t shut down correctly errors and Chrome dumps all of my tabs 
len ratingtwo I have tabs in both the normal and incognito windows when I don t feel like dealing with targeted ads and obviously you can t get incognito windows back 
len ratingtwo This is becoming so frequent that it s starting to be a problem 
len ratingfive This is dope bro
len ratingtwo  Title says it all 
len ratingtwo  By far the most infuriating feature is how poorly Chrome maintains open tabs no matter whose software you re using 
len ratingtwo Sometimes you can restore closed windows to get your tabs back and more often not 
len ratingtwo The UI constantly changes randomly that being able to access basic functions like this is a gamble 
len ratingtwo My experience with this was on Windows but using an iPad it s even worse 
len ratingtwo The iPad lets you drag links from other apps to be opened in your designated primary web browser set mine to Chrome 
len ratingtwo This function is pretty annoying and can be opened accidentally but doing so with Chrome clears all the other tabs away rather than making a new one without the commands to restore them 
len ratingtwo How is this useful or logical 
len ratingtwo Step it up Chrome you re pissing us off 
len ratingone EVERY TIME I look up something on chrome I get the message This Site can t be reached with a sad face It s not any sadder than my face 
len ratingone I don t understand why it s supposed to be so much better than google which works 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome Dome 
len ratingone This browser stinks 
len ratingone It s plagued with all sorts of bugs 
len ratingone I m pretty sure google isn t going to update it cause of apples new ad tracking policy and how it s going to cost all these companies money 
len ratingone I don t expect any more updates lol
len ratingone Don t download it 
len ratingone It has caused my phone to crash several time 
len ratingone Been trying to remove it but for some reason it won t it s like google has taken control of my phone 
len ratingone I about ready to wipe the phone and start over 
len ratingone Don t download 
len ratingtwo It is something I NEVER use intentionally but is very easy to click accidentally and very difficult to fix afterwards 
len ratingtwo It s caused me multiple issues in the past and should not be such a large button 
len ratingfour I really like the app but can you add App Nap so users won t get hacked 
len ratingtwo  Has a weird bug where to of the right side of the screen will be unused 
len ratingtwo Often from the phone orientation changing 
len ratingtwo Once it does this I can t figure out how to widen it again 
len ratingtwo Zooming doesn t really help because everything is bigger 
len ratingtwo This app didn t used to do that 
len ratingtwo The app is free and there s some bizarrely worded reviews acting like they ll go spend all this browser money elsewhere if Google keeps ignoring them 
len ratingtwo All I want to state is that you could save yourself some time by looking for a different browser app 
len ratingtwo This one is not it 
len ratingone Even if Apple s terms of service changed for Google months and counting since the last app update is inexcusable 
len ratingone A bunch of other Google apps have been updated 
len ratingone Get with it Google and update Chrome
len ratingtwo Don t say are you a hacker or something on google bc the truth about google is hackers are in google but it would be better if there was no hackers
len ratingtwo It is nice to have the same browser on all my devices with the history and passwords except that it quit syncing my passwords
len ratingthree So sometimes it keeps CRASHING every time I try to enter it 
len ratingthree I just need to re install it BUT another annoying thing is when you did an Update and it wouldn t let me go into YouTube studio the good thing about this is that it get pass my time limit uwu so 
len ratingthree Hi According to your Google search there is Zoom text when you tap but I tried many times I still cannot find it 
len ratingthree Is my chrome faulty 
len ratingthree Thank you Best regards Pok Beng Lim
len ratingthree Running iOS 
len ratingone It won t let me delete the app
len ratingone  I don t like chrome 
len ratingone I lost my YouTube channel cuz of it 
len ratingone I don t like chrome 
len ratingone Last update is awful lots of bugs screen crashes is all messed up just awful 
len ratingone Safari here i come 
len ratingtwo Four months amp no update 
len ratingtwo That s ridiculous 
len ratingtwo Whenever I m scrolling all of a sudden the page will shrink to one side amp it seems the only way to temporarily fix it is to close the browser amp restart 
len ratingtwo Today I wake up amp I can t check my email 
len ratingtwo It says No offline messages I ve closed it out amp reopened it several times to no avail

len ratingfour Chrome is one of the best web browsing app there is but some websites present issues with the touch screen like the scroll on heavy or complicated pages 
len ratingone Google tracks you and if you buy google products it tracks you so do not download this app and it s products invade privacy and more try another browser but not this one it s has built in cameras in their products do not sign in and if you search up about google tracking you you believed me if not DO NOT DOWNLOAD GOOGLE 
len ratingtwo Please fix it
len ratingone I hate it Chrome is so bad itHorrible it is such a bad app 
len ratingone It kept loging me out back to my home page and I deleted it and tryed to redowload it I didn t work
len ratingfive Y all are helping me watch YouTube with screen time so yea 
len ratingone This issue has been going on for so long without an update 
len ratingone It constantly zooms the entire page in while I try to navigate and won t go back to normal 
len ratingone Reload the page or not 
len ratingone I have to open a new browser to fix it 
len ratingone Extremely annoying 
len ratingone Besides that it s great if that was fixed 
len ratingone But this happens to me almost every time I try to use it
len ratingthree  This App Is Only Good Your Browser App Isn t Working amp or Even Safari Browser 
len ratingtwo They really made this app for smh
len ratingfive  I can go on the hub now
len ratingone I used to love Chrome I ve used it for a long time but something happened with one of their new updates and now it is terrible 
len ratingone I teach English online and also attend classes online and now the sites I use for these things do not even work on Chrome anymore 
len ratingone It just freezes up and now when I am typing I always have to wait for it to catch up to me it keeps crashing and I often have to restart it for it to load a website 
len ratingone I thought Maybe it s my internet or ipad So I tried it on my android phone and I m having similar problems 
len ratingone Then I downloaded FireFox and it s been working fantastic no problems at all and it s super fast 
len ratingfive I have a iPhone and I use for chrome it works just fine what is wrong with y all
len ratingfive I think I like Crome I mean it s not better than anything but it s not worse either
len ratingfive I love the organization of chrome the quality is definitely better than safari you made a literal whole new setup for YouTube Facebook etc I m really glad that chrome is here 
len ratingone With all the issues and no solutions you can keep your chrome contained to someone else s phone
len ratingone Switching to another browser because of the page squish bug that has been happening for months 
len ratingfive Zont listen to the people who say this app is horrible I honestly think they should get a reward for this app it s the same as normal google just with incognito mode also bootyfull
len ratingtwo This used to be my go to web browser but it seems to be getting glitchier with each update 
len ratingtwo Not only that but they collect far more data than Microsoft 
len ratingtwo I guess I m moving to Edge 
len ratingone Recently switched to the Chrome app with an iPhone Pro upgrade 
len ratingone I use Chrome on my PC so was excited at the thought of being able to seamlessly switch from phone to PC when needed and especially now that Chrome can be set to default browser with iOS 
len ratingone Way too many bugs in the iOS version though 
len ratingone Like many others have mentioned page competition consistently messes up and jumps off the screen to the left pages wiggle left and right when scrolling not allowing for a quick enough scroll and I ve experienced not being able to scroll many pages in general with the page constantly jumping back to the top as I try to scroll down 
len ratingone Simply way too bugs to continue using when I ve never had any of these issues with Safari 
len ratingone I ll be sticking with Safari until these bugs are fixed 
len ratingtwo cannot add anything into bookmarks on iPad Air when will you fix this problem 
len ratingone upgrade your app 
len ratingone Go through all the reviews and you can find all the reasons not to ever use google 
len ratingone We try to keep our lives as private as possible 
len ratingone I downloaded Brave which is a more sophisticated browser than Chrome 
len ratingone Not to mention it runs on block chain technology so it is a completely decentralized internet 
len ratingone Also the design and lay out of the app is quite savvy 
len ratingone Lost important tabs when chrome for iPhone crashed 
len ratingone No ability to reopen all the tabs at once 
len ratingone Get with the times google 
len ratingone Switching to another browser now
len ratingfive This app has this website called K online school 
len ratingfive That website is PERFECT for my school 
len ratingfive I like that you added that website 
len ratingtwo It doesn t let me watch YouTube
len ratingfive Dark day
len ratingone I keep deleting Chrome app off my iPhone XS Max and re downloading it in hopes of fixing this huge annoying problem 
len ratingone The problem Every time I open a new tab it automatically sends me to another tab usually the top left tab I already had open 
len ratingone It s clearly a bug because I ve deleted all my caches and cookies multiple times and no luck 
len ratingone I usually have tabs open 
len ratingone For years this never happened 
len ratingone Now for months this has been happening 
len ratingone And yes it s on the latest update as well as my iOS 
len ratingone It s like when you open your car door but then your truck opens up on its own 
len ratingone It s like taking a bite out of pizza but then you realize you just ate a boring piece of dried broccoli 
len ratingone It s like working at Google for a year as a programmer on the iOS Chrome app but then realize you broke what was never broken to begin with on your updates 
len ratingone And I can honestly say that it runs so trash on the iPhone that I m switching to safari 
len ratingone I feel like they stole everything from me multiple times weeks and months of tabs I left open to revisit websites were just closed and no way to reopen them just the history nothing but a mockery since one tab can create so much data history that when you look at it there is no way to go through and reopen everything that was closed by chrome you can t remember all the important stuff either 
len ratingone It s becoming worse and worse 
len ratingone It just doesn t render web sites very well 
len ratingone It reminds me of the early days of smartphones when browsing sucked 
len ratingfive I really like chrome and there s easy access to the internet on this app 
len ratingfive But I m pretty frustrated about YouTube bc when you sign in it does not see your history and stuff like that 
len ratingfive I think its better than safari 
len ratingfive A few days ago i went to a scam website about apple support that kept trying to make me call the number 
len ratingfive But chrome stoped it with an alert saying that its repeatedly trying to go to another app 
len ratingone Finally comes out in iOS that google chrome catches more user data than any other web browser on iPhone 
len ratingone I m surprised anyone uses this browser now that you show you track everything people do on it 
len ratingone Your flipping slowwwwww
len ratingone Sooo annoying had to delete this app today 
len ratingone It keeps crashing then closes out completely 
len ratingone Then when opening the app again it gets rid of all previous open tabs you had 
len ratingone Getting the old google app again good riddens 
len ratingone Google is making billions every year sending YOUR private data to the highest bidders and while that might not bother you it should 
len ratingone You are not a product Google is and they shouldn t be selling us like cows to the slaughter 
len ratingone Just take a look at their privacy label and see how comfortable you are with a company having that much access to your personal life then turning around and selling it for profit 
len ratingone BOYCOTT GOOGLE 
len ratingone I used to use this app all the time until version which killed gif saving 
len ratingone The only time I use chrome now is on a pc or my jail broken iPhone which I was able to downgrade to that version 
len ratingthree I keep getting this error message and I don t know how to fix it because I can t use google
len ratingthree  I tried to search something my friend showed me with google chrome on his laptop and I downloaded it on my iPad and it didn t work
len ratingtwo The app crashed and when I opened it every single tab was gone 
len ratingtwo Both incognito and normal 
len ratingtwo I had over tabs are you serious 
len ratingtwo I had just opened the app and was gonna look something up and now I lost everytbing 
len ratingfour The app is AMAZING but I cant chnage the back ground on ipad it is possible but I wish there was a button called backgrounds in my settings section and it was easier to change back grounds over all this app is AWSOME
len ratingone I used to use this app so much 
len ratingone Just that it s not good there s bugs and a lot I d Wright more but lol
len ratingone Google com will freeze 
len ratingone The home page really 
len ratingone It doesn t take no for an answer 
len ratingone Do you want to synchronize with this account 
len ratingone I have to say no ever single time just to open it 
len ratingone If the is a remember my answer I didn t see it 
len ratingone Overall I would not recommend it 
len ratingtwo Ok so I m ion an iPad th generation and whenever I go into google chrome app it crashes 
len ratingtwo It never used to do this and I don t know why it started doing it today 
len ratingtwo I ll try shutting down my iPad and restarting it again 
len ratingtwo But I think it will be the same 
len ratingtwo Please fix this it keeps kicking me out of the app 
len ratingfive  Ahahahahahah
len ratingone Google chrome has continued to get worse after every update
len ratingfive  The porn is so amazing 
len ratingfive I think it is your best intrest 
len ratingone Terra book quality I just hate it just get rid of it
len ratingfive  Yaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy
len ratingfour I have been using Chrome for as long as I can remember but I only noticed in February that the GIFs I save do not move 
len ratingfour The first one I thought it was just a one time thing but then it kept happening 
len ratingfour I hope this can be fixed asap
len ratingone Chrome update MIA
len ratingone  I have used Google Chrome for years then I wondered I was agreeing to by clicking I have agreed to the terms of use and privacy policy 
len ratingone Google is a stalker 
len ratingone Has anyone but me actually read the privacy policy 
len ratingone They follow you everywhere with ads sell your information to the highest bidder and collect information on you on almost every website with their Google Tracking Network 
len ratingone Google says Google uses your information for a more personalized experience 
len ratingone Did you know how a company famous for an entirely free service without the option to donate or upgrade account makes money 
len ratingone And did you know the United States government is suing google for bn dollars because google tracks people 
len ratingone THAT S how bad Google is 
len ratingthree  please add a reader view option in chrome 
len ratingthree i love chrome but have switched back to FF because they offer it mobile webpages can be so glitchy with ads and videos and reader view is super helpful in sorting through that those of us with adhd add would really appreciate it 
len ratingthree  also when i press the new tab button at the bottom of each page it should take me to a new page and automatically open up my keyboard to search 
len ratingthree super minor inconvenience but i notice it enough thanks 
len ratingone  Lol
len ratingone  Ew
len ratingone Your apps are really bad 
len ratingone Takes so long to load and very buggy 
len ratingone I hate you 
len ratingone No one should ever use this app 
len ratingone Never
len ratingfive  I just use this to watch porn
len ratingfive So about every reveiw on google or google chrome are not good 
len ratingfive I mean like they are all making google seem like sus 
len ratingfive But honeyyyy can everyone just admit that they literally always use google Like even tho there are flaws google is our go to 
len ratingfive So atleast give our most popular search engine a little love 
len ratingone I RECOMMEND THIS BROWSER 
len ratingone USE THIS AS YOUR BROWSER
len ratingthree App keeps crashing and all open tabs are closed when app is restarted
len ratingone I am currently migrating everything ALL out of google 
len ratingone Their products simply aren t worth the blatant violations they perpetrate against their users 
len ratingone I ve moved on to much more respectful and just as effective apps 
len ratingone Lately Chrome has been crashing all the time 
len ratingone Even upon reopening and trying to restore tabs it would crash again 
len ratingone Using it became tedious and time consuming 
len ratingone Here s a fix change default default browser to Firefox 
len ratingthree I really like chrome but the update isn t that good 
len ratingthree You can t really see the search bar at the top and the design wasn t that good 
len ratingone  It is poopy
len ratingone Google profits off your data and half of the pages when you google something are ads 
len ratingone What a terrible company
len ratingone Google is in the business of selling data for targeted advertising and that is the price you pay for using this app Might I suggest Firefox 
len ratingfive Please fix those squashed pages during the switch between portrait and landscape 
len ratingfive iOS
len ratingfive I like the network and no glitches and well TIS JUST A GREAT APP 
len ratingtwo Not sure what s going on it s never been an issue before I have always been able to use Chrome on my iPhone now immediately upon opening the app it waits for me to put something in the search bar and roughly about two letters in it just completely disappeared try deleting it and tried restarting my phone I hope date in my phone nothing
len ratingone  Today s news reviled that Chrome was in fact spyware 
len ratingone I deleted my Chrome browser today and downloaded DuckDuckGo 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome and Google 
len ratingone Forever 
len ratingone Everytime i use the app i have to keep switching back to mobile view cause it keeps going back to desktop view plz fix
len ratingone Very difficult getting the web store downloaded it s not an option given
len ratingthree Chrome stops in the middle of web sites 
len ratingthree Locks up 
len ratingthree Have to start over 
len ratingfive My favorite thing abt google chrome is that I couldn t find gacha editor in App Store so I did it in google chrome and like it was there thank 
len ratingfive You
len ratingfive Nice 
len ratingone Yeah
len ratingone This is the best app ever
len ratingtwo Like many others for MONTHS I ve had the issue where the screen gets pushed to one side 
len ratingtwo How it hasn t been fixed yet is beyond me 
len ratingtwo I ve gone back to using Safari until this super obnoxious glitch is fixed 
len ratingtwo The app for Apple is not very stable 
len ratingtwo Pages I ve had open abruptly close when I toggle between apps 
len ratingtwo Some pages have trouble loading 
len ratingtwo I really prefer Chrome over using Safari but Google needs to do better 
len ratingone  This app crashes constantly
len ratingone  months later and no updates no fix 
len ratingone Cmon google 
len ratingone It keeps crashing for no reason no tabs open
len ratingtwo Everytime I rotate my phone in landscape and back onto portrait again it ends up shrinking the webpage altogether 
len ratingtwo I can t do anything without constantly closing and reopening the tab 
len ratingtwo Please fix this as other browsers do not have this issue 
len ratingtwo I had to delete this app multiple times and even after that YouTube STILL shrinks not matter what I do 
len ratingtwo This does not happen on any other web browser I use 
len ratingthree  It uses a lot of of the battery while safari doesnt 
len ratingthree Issues with the page not being centered Issues with loading full pages Really frustrating to use
len ratingone Rotating bug pls fix
len ratingfive  This app is amazing you deserve million I love it keep making more apps and also can you also suggest a Roblox app another one please 
len ratingone Chrome crashes multiple times each month with no apparent cause 
len ratingone Safari never crashes even it has just as many tabs open 
len ratingone My phone is up to date and plenty of storage 
len ratingone Why so many crashes 
len ratingone It does not do this on my laptop 
len ratingtwo The app has become almost unbearable to use 
len ratingtwo Anytime I minimize the app and then open again the window shrinks to about of the full screen 
len ratingtwo I like using Chrome as I sync across computers iPads and phones however if this issue isn t fixed soon I ll find a new internet browser
len ratingone  Lately Chrome has been crashing all the time 
len ratingone This was never was an issue before 
len ratingthree add crime webstore on mobile devices 
len ratingthree There have been dozens of times that I ve accidentally pushed Close All Tabs 
len ratingthree Either add a confirmation window Are you sure you would like to close x number of tabs or put it in the menu 
len ratingthree Just anything but in the upper left hand corner of the tabs view 
len ratingtwo Unable to add bookmarks to chrome on iPad 
len ratingtwo Yes I ve read the forums and tutorials not worth my time to bother
len ratingone Some sites work some don t all the sudden 
len ratingone Fix it you have the money
len ratingfive Creators of this app when ever I went to a game it wouldn t work at all please fix that problem 
len ratingone On iphone pro there is an issue with rotating the screen then rotating back 
len ratingone Fix that it is already funny
len ratingone A hyper focus on targeted advertising is making Google much less effective as a search engine 
len ratingone The more you use it the more it steers you to things the algorithm says you might buy 
len ratingone Or at least click on an ad for 
len ratingone And the less effective Google becomes for finding new things 
len ratingfive I love google I can any game for free like Minecraft and among us with hack I love gooGle 
len ratingone  I left this review on the Youtube app as well 
len ratingone I made a Google account so I could make a YT account so I could watch my friends content 
len ratingone I replied to someone s comment about a movie trailer and I was not violating the guidelines all I said was something to the fact of ikr 
len ratingone let kids be kids 
len ratingone I was replying to someones comment too so if my obedient REPLY got my ENTIRE channel AND google account banned how come the comment that I replied to wasn t banned 
len ratingone So I figured it may have been an issue with the app or my phone so I made an ENTIRE new google account I didn t reply to anything and I had only subscribed to SSSniperWolf and THAT channel AND account was banned 
len ratingone I tried again one final time to just subscribe to my ACTUAL friend s channel and I commented awesome amv Anime Music Video got a thank you and guess what 
len ratingone I 
len ratingone GOT 
len ratingone BANNED 
len ratingone A THIRD TIME 
len ratingone I am extremely confused with this as I had an obedient Google account obedient channel name wasn t saying or doing ANYTHING to violate the Terms of Service and I got banned three times with three different accounts and channels please fix so I can watch my friend s videos 
len ratingone google Chrome takes me hours to look up one thing internet explorer is so much easier to use it only takes ten seconds to look up something
len ratingone Chrome has always been great but for the past few months the pages don t load right 
len ratingone If you mess with zooming pages or go back to a page they will never load to fill your screen 
len ratingone They usually either load to the left with empty space on the right side or it stays zoomed out with empty spaces on both sides very stupid 
len ratingtwo I love the app but the pop up blocker doesn t seem to be working at all very annoying please please please please please allow extensions for chrome for iOS that would help tremendously because I hate getting pop ups while searching also the app keeps on pushing to the left so it s not aligned properly it s really annoying and at least a white bar gap all the way to the rightAlso the glitch that basically re put your phone in landscape back to portrait it basically means the entire webpage off to the side of the screen which is very annoying and when I m typing in chrome it seems to move the page up every single time I type please get your crap together I m I m switching to a new app
len ratingone Delete Chrome App
len ratingfive Ehh 
len ratingfive It s really not that bad tbh 
len ratingfive Some things could be better 
len ratingfive But I recommend getting it 
len ratingfive All it takes is some time to get used to certain features 
len ratingfive Especially if you ve been using Safari all it really takes is some time to get used to it 
len ratingfive The app itself is really pretty great 
len ratingfive I d recommend it 
len ratingfive I m not sure about all the sucky reviews 
len ratingfive Cause I liked it 
len ratingfive App is crashing
len ratingone I m not one to write reviews so this is how you know I m very frustrated 
len ratingone This app crashes and when the option pops up to recover all my tabs it disappears after seconds 
len ratingone I am beyond angry 
len ratingone Google needs to do a better job of listening to customer complaints and feedback this is getting ridiculous
len ratingtwo It was working well a year ago then all of my bookmarks disappeared 
len ratingtwo Now I have recently lost all of my open pages twice 
len ratingtwo I might have to totally switch over to Firefox now 
len ratingone Web pages load at half the page width Password memory is unusable Page refreshes are stupidly slow compared safari and that it s is pathetic Use safari or Firefox instead of that heap of crap that call a browser sadly this used to be the best but they have decided to become the next internet explorer
len ratingthree Steals your data obviously 
len ratingthree It s Google lol
len ratingtwo  Why is the app Google Chrime so slow to load now 
len ratingtwo it took almost minutes why is this app so slow
len ratingone i only have this for school
len ratingone Every week this app crashes and i lose all the tabs I had open there s no way to recover them since recently closed tabs is just showing your viewing history 
len ratingone Can t believe i m going back to safari but here we are 
len ratingtwo iPhone has a stable mobile connection 
len ratingtwo Any known website will load just fine 
len ratingtwo Anytime I attempt to use google search on chrome it fails to load 
len ratingtwo I ve uninstalled the app clear the cache browser settings and the problem returns on reinstall 
len ratingone It won t fit my screen nor will it let me move my cursor half of the time 
len ratingone Will definitely go back to google for this one 
len ratingthree It s OK but it could have more improvements 
len ratingthree Google Chrome is a fast mobile browser but I have one major problem it doesn t integrate with the iOS screen time feature 
len ratingthree This app is always on even during screen time limits 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s great 
len ratingtwo Please fix the resizing bug when switching from portrait to landscape and back 
len ratingone Huge bug right now where my iPhone plus app keeps crashing and I m losing my tabs 
len ratingtwo Ok I need this app to do stuff when I loose my homework or want to see cute yorkies and Pomeranians 
len ratingtwo It needs internet tho 
len ratingtwo When i was bored on a plane before COVID I wanted to look at a puppy 
len ratingtwo Thanks to DUMB internet I CAN T 
len ratingtwo Also you need top quality internet to use this app if your me 
len ratingtwo Otherwise it can get slow 
len ratingtwo Thank you for your time good day or night stay healthy AND MAYBE IF YOU MAKE A BETTER APP ALL REVIEWS WILL BE STARS 
len ratingtwo I m leaving this app and the emojis will explain 
len ratingfive I only got this for the Dinosaur game 
len ratingone I lost all of my tabs and there is no way to recover them 
len ratingone Every time I connect my google YouTube to my tv and it disconnects you are all like BuT YOu REseTeD iT like I didn t even reset and somtimes the app is still open I hate this I m switching to safari
len ratingtwo Screen keeps getting puahes to the right 
len ratingtwo I love Chrome but by it always doing that I have been using other browsers lately 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo Sounds like this is a problem for everyone but getting ignored 
len ratingone  u chrome 
len ratingone You made me lose my YouTube account 
len ratingone I will never use this again 
len ratingone P S this is an edit 
len ratingone I am sorry about what I said 
len ratingone I was really mad 
len ratingone Let me know if you could do anything to help 
len ratingone Google has finally done it they ve finally made me convert to using Safari on my iPhone instead of Chrome because apparently Google doesn t care about listening to their customers who have repeatedly asked for a fix to this issue for entirely too long now 
len ratingone I m just glad Safari is now much better than it used to be 
len ratingfive Plz bring back YouTube dark mode and fix shuttering and lag
len ratingtwo This app has become a hassle to use 
len ratingtwo It s loading time is slow even when the connection is good the site crashes almost every week and sometimes webpages don t load 
len ratingtwo It s so annoying and bothersome 
len ratingone way too easy to accidentally delete all your tabs when you re moving tabs around 
len ratingone if you hold down on a tab just long enough it makes a new window that is destined to eat every other tab you had open 
len ratingone the history tab then doesn t display what you had open accurately so you just lose everything 
len ratingone braindead design
len ratingone You guys are grows you don t seem to care about anyone but yourself how dar you ignore us I can see tons of reviews on here witch people hate fix the issue or pay the prize jurks
len ratingtwo It s ok easy to use 
len ratingtwo Good UI 
len ratingtwo But censors a lot of opinions especially related to politics health or competitors 
len ratingtwo You can t really trust it to provide relevant search results 
len ratingtwo Def wouldn t recommend for any research 
len ratingthree  Lately when I close a tab the tab will somehow be open the next time I open the app 
len ratingthree Please fix this terrible bug 
len ratingone The tabs experience is completely broken 
len ratingone If you open up the tab panel it will randomly select a tab and switch to it before you have a chance to see the list and pick what you actually want 
len ratingone This has been an issue discussed on Reddit since December and basically crippled the app 
len ratingone I have no idea how it as gone unfixed up until this point 
len ratingone Everything else works great but until the tabs functionality is fixed I cannot use this as my main browser 
len ratingone When I downloaded it wouldn t let me use it saying that I needed to download it and kept taking me to the App Store where I had already downloaded it and just wouldn t let me use it 
len ratingone Screen breaks and pushes right
len ratingone F u
len ratingtwo Always loved chrome but ever since I got the iPhone mini it has been plagued with browser margin issues 
len ratingtwo No update has yet fixed this 
len ratingone Chrome constantly freezes crashes and burns on an iPad and iPhone 
len ratingone Deplorable 
len ratingone It is frustrating because I need to use it 
len ratingone Surprising this developer of any can t get it right 
len ratingone It s been this way for a few years now 
len ratingone Given Google s recent misleading pro privacy PR announcement about no longer allowing rd party cookies I can no longer recommend this browser for anyone I know 
len ratingone Companies need to be punished when they make moves to increase monopoly power 
len ratingone It s no secret that Google services are free because Google makes money on de identified personal data but this move to cut other companies out of the big data market which already is a shady business is not acceptable 
len ratingone I m migrating from Google services as well 
len ratingfive its really good app
len ratingtwo Almost every mobile site I have visited in the last month it re sizes to about half of my browser window and shifts to the left 
len ratingtwo It s driving me nuts 
len ratingtwo I can usually get it to go back by reloading the URL but it doesn t always last 
len ratingtwo It seems like other folks are having a similar issue 
len ratingtwo I ve been using chrome on iOS for years and I ve never had a problem like this 
len ratingtwo It s time for an update 
len ratingtwo I had been a big fan of using google chrome but off late have started moving away from it 
len ratingtwo My phone has got autorotation on and every time my browser switches between landscape and portrait mode the pages become distorted and the old way to fix it is to kill the tab and re open it 
len ratingtwo So frustrating 
len ratingone I love Chrome always use it on all my iPhones and on my computers 
len ratingone But since I got an iPhone I ve been having issues with Chrome and the screen rotation feature 
len ratingone while using chrome when I move it from portrait to landscape mode then back I lose about to of the screen unless I close out the tab and reopen it 
len ratingone I know I m not the only user to have this problem and I ve checked that both my iOS and chrome app are up to date with the newest version 
len ratingone I would be happy to change my review once this problem is fixed unfortunately it s just a very problematic issue 
len ratingone I was trying to download this on my son s iPad however it says this app is for 
len ratingone Why is this happening and how can I fix it 
len ratingone This is a joke that I ve had this issue for over a year now 
len ratingone Every time my phone gets turned to landscape and than back to portrait the scaling is altered and doesn t fit the screen 
len ratingone FIX THIS ISSUE 
len ratingone How has this not been fixed yet after a YEAR 
len ratingone The only reason I continue to use chrome is because I use it on my desktop 
len ratingone If not I would dump this app because of this issue alone and the fact the chrome team isn t even paying any attention to it 
len ratingfive It s is amazing only cause i can watch porn
len ratingfive It works i recemond it for anybody
len ratingone Google just got a monopoly on your web data 
len ratingone They can go corn dog themselves with a lamppost 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone  Annoying
len ratingone FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST FIX THIS BROKEN APP 
len ratingone Recently switched iPhonepromax from a pixelxl 
len ratingone Google can no longer be trusted 
len ratingone Safari is a good browser just takes some time to learn 
len ratingone Leaving google and never looking back 
len ratingone FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX THE TABS 
len ratingone When I open tabs the one to the top left gets maximized 
len ratingone A few other reviews mention this too 
len ratingone Come on developers we need a patch update 
len ratingone Will switch browsers soon if nothing is updated 
len ratingfour  Overall it is just an awesome app for a browser 
len ratingfour The only suggestion that I could come up with is reducing the amount of data it uses when you are using cellular data 
len ratingfour I ve been in the car and out of the blue I used a TON of data 
len ratingfour Hope this helps in any way 
len ratingfive  TYSM CHROME YOUR LETTING ME WATCH YOUTUBE WHEN I HAVE SCREEN TIME ON IT SO YEA TY
len ratingone Fix the screen rotation and the tabs switching with prompt pleaseeeeee 
len ratingone I haven t used safari in years but now I want to switch to it with bugs chrome has now 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingone Or maybe they don t care 
len ratingone At this point it seems G doesn t care or can t fix the problem 
len ratingone A web browser has evolved into quite a lot of things but at its core it is TO VIEW WEB PAGES and chrome can t even do that 
len ratingone If you can t render pages accurately on iOS I have no choice but to use safari 
len ratingone  Google is a terrible company
len ratingone I just had to download chrome in order to do something my phone wouldn t do with other browsers 
len ratingone Now there doesn t seem to be any way to delete chrome from my phone now that I m done with it 
len ratingone If this cannot be deleted I will terminate my relationship with Apple I m telling you right now 
len ratingone I do not want this on my phone 
len ratingtwo Why does Chrome push my pages to the left and leave space on the sides instead of using the entire screen 
len ratingtwo Extremely frustrating and it also happens to the pages I open when I use Chrome to search 
len ratingtwo Chrome is the only browser I have used for years and I love the new ish feature that highlights articles that are of interest to me in fact I check these multiple times a day and it is one of my go to information sites Please fix this 
len ratingtwo I really don t want to have to find a new browser search 
len ratingone Recently has been terribly bugged won t open pages takes forever to load back button doesn t work 
len ratingone Please fix this
len ratingfive I really like it and the way it s trying to keep my passwords and keeping my business private We have to outsmart the Hackers and block them out 
len ratingfive I found out that boost mobile store s employees are getting our credit cards numbers and they have all our business if you are a customer and they using it and charging things to your card 
len ratingfive This girl has hacked my card and using it to buy everything they want the first time she spent then so much money I can t have enough time to say so don t use boost mobile and give them your card information like PIN number 
len ratingfive I m going change phone company They even changed things to Boost mobile Chrome and Google are trying to keep my phone safe 
len ratingone  They deleted another review not surprised how lazy the app keeps opening on pages I ve closed 
len ratingone It s been doing that since last year and I ve reported it to then several times 
len ratingthree  safari keeps popping up in the side for no reason and I don t know why 
len ratingthree Cant you just remove this feature because I have to reinstall the app to fix it 
len ratingfour The app shuts down automatically 
len ratingfour My storage is totally full which might lead to the issue but once I turn the phone off and then back on it usually remedies 
len ratingfive  This is so good
len ratingone The app has crashed for the second time in the last month taking all my tabs with it 
len ratingone Every time I switch from horizontal to vertical view the page shrinks 
len ratingone I have to exit the app and reload it for it to go back to normal 
len ratingone It s very frustrating 
len ratingone If this persists I m going to use a different browser 
len ratingone It seems as though the Chrome makers can t be other fixing bugs within the app as this issue has been ongoing for over a month 
len ratingfive  I am a fan D
len ratingfive I gotta say for once I found something that is free the only downside is I want it on my iPad and it says I can t well it s great thing I love it 
len ratingfive Chrome rules 
len ratingfive That s all 
len ratingone  I despise all things Google 
len ratingone Have tried Chrome for iOS multiple times and always found it impossible to configure settings other than just agreeing to share everything with Google 
len ratingone Sync settings just fail to respond 
len ratingone  Good programs should be multi OS and multi platform 
len ratingone  Google has the technology to stop fake gmail accounts but refuses to do so 
len ratingone I along with other random people gets spammed daily in group text messages by different fake gmail accounts 
len ratingone It s been over different fake accounts now 
len ratingone Not to mention how horrendously Google sells your privacy and data it is no surprise that our information would comprised on a daily basis 
len ratingone  Whenever my phone accidentally goes into landscape mode the entire page gets screwed up by either framing all the content into a really narrow frame smashing it against the side of the window or zooming in and not allowing me to zoom out 
len ratingone This is getting absurd 
len ratingone I think I m just going to switch back to safari on mobile and desktop at this point 
len ratingone This bug is the last straw for me 
len ratingthree Hi
len ratingone Crashes too often 
len ratingone Downloads just stop 
len ratingone Page refreshes when scrolling 
len ratingone Pages constantly refresh while doing nothing 
len ratingone Restarting ipad solves issues for like ten minutes and the bugs go at it again 
len ratingone Tabs die forcing more refreshes 
len ratingfive It is cool I get to do school on there and I get to see any apps for free
len ratingthree please make it so that when you click on a website it shows where the statements were in the preview you don t know how much time i wasted looking for specific sentences in an article 
len ratingthree This is funni stuffs idk why im making this comment XDDDD
len ratingtwo  Why is the app Google Chrime so slow to load now 
len ratingtwo it took almost minutes why is this app so slow
len ratingthree  So like all the other lovely people here I m also not a huge fan of what Chrome has been up to lately 
len ratingthree I ve read a few of the other comments and I ll admit my problems aren t as big as theirs but my screen keeps getting pushed to the right constantly and yeah I found a faster way to get it to get back to the center again by pushing the URL button and hitting cancel but the fact that I have to do that without it getting fixed is an issue 
len ratingthree We use your app because we want to not because we have to 
len ratingthree The fact that you re ignoring our comments saying please fix this is a major issue that will cause your users to find other internet browser apps that are more trustworthy 
len ratingthree Once in a while the site acts like I m on a pc only site and become really hard to scroll down which is also a bit of a problem because I just can t hit the URL button and hit cancel 
len ratingthree I actually have to delete that tab and go through my history again because I can t copy and paste the URL because it does it again 
len ratingthree That s not cool and the fact that you re ignoring this is also not cool 
len ratingthree Fix this please or I will be going to a new app 
len ratingtwo I can t even get stylish 
len ratingtwo It won t let me click add to chrome mines out of date I JUST GOT IT 
len ratingtwo Help me please to think of it I DONT EVEN HAVE THE ADD TO CHROME BUTTON A ALL
len ratingone Too much space ad tracking not as good as Microsoft Edge Firefox or Safari 
len ratingone  This app tracks your every move and sells your information to other companies 
len ratingone I recommend another browser called Duck Duck Go 
len ratingfive  I Can Watch YouTube And Watch Naked People 
len ratingfive Wait Years For My Naked Body 
len ratingfive president
len ratingthree When I zoom in it gets stuck and won t let me zoom back out 
len ratingthree Very annoying
len ratingthree It used to work perfectly for me but now it just keeps freezing and won t let me click any buttons
len ratingone This bug has been around for quite some time and it looks like google is dragging their feet to fix their software 
len ratingone It s sad when Safari and Firefox beat out Chrome 
len ratingfive  Highland park is ML 
len ratingfive It s good for YouTube try it yourself
len ratingone UPDATE PLS 
len ratingfive I m not here to say something bad
len ratingthree The title says it all 
len ratingthree The screen shrinks when switching back from landscape view with a iPhone mini 
len ratingthree It cuts about a quarter of the screen off on each side 
len ratingthree I ll gladly give you back the five star rating once this issue is fixed yes I already uninstalled reinstalled power culled the phone etc 
len ratingthree Safari doesn t have this issue it s your app 
len ratingthree Bummer cause I like chrome a lot more 
len ratingone Syncing of history is good enough Search terms is not required
len ratingfive Ah
len ratingtwo For some reason the app works great for a few minutes and then everything gets pushed to the left and the whole right side is a margin 
len ratingtwo The more I use Google products the less I like them 
len ratingtwo I wish I wasn t so entrenched with their services 
len ratingtwo It might be time to abandon my old online persona and just start over somewhere else 
len ratingfive I would recommend very good
len ratingone I was downloading it was it wasn t I wanted to cancel it and redo it again but it let me cancel 
len ratingone That s why I rated this star 
len ratingtwo Bug everywhere
len ratingone Censorship at its finest
len ratingone Chrome has dangerous chemicals it s toxic it s like badly trust me 
len ratingone Unethical company
len ratingthree  Phone drags even with open tabs unused 
len ratingone In the ad where the people were humming to the song I decided to try it and it didn t work 
len ratingone Don t download and get your hopes up 
len ratingone I hate google it Just claims not to sell your information but it does sell your information
len ratingtwo This app frequently doesn t work in integration of apple 
len ratingtwo I get pop ups that say it s not a new enough version even though it is or won t allow video chat integration through my iPad 
len ratingtwo I ve seen a lot of people complaining about this and we were promised a fix months ago 
len ratingtwo When using an iPhone if you turn it to landscape and the back to portrait margins appear on the side and the content no longer takes up the entire width of the screen 
len ratingtwo It s incredibly frustrating 
len ratingthree I m actually really enjoying Chrome but one thing I CANNOT stand is when you are viewing a website on landscape mode and then rotate it right side up to where it was the page is zoomed in and you cannot zoom all the way back out 
len ratingtwo  Why is the app Google Chrime so slow to load now 
len ratingtwo it took almost minutes
len ratingtwo Title says it all 
len ratingtwo Can t view full webpages because this reason 
len ratingone This is ridiculous how bad Chrome has gotten for iOS 
len ratingone When you switch your iPhone from portrait and landscape the whole page is shifted to the left 
len ratingone You can temporarily fix this by going to the address bar where the link is and hitting Cancel but it s annoying 
len ratingone The WORST problem though is the keyboard will bug on chrome and it won t come up AT ALL 
len ratingone You physically can t type anything 
len ratingone This seems to be an issue on Safari as well and it s frustrating 
len ratingone There has been no updates or acknowledgement that this is a problem and it s frustrating 
len ratingone Installed remote access and URL redirects 
len ratingone Is the most vile of human waste
len ratingone Extremely buggy 
len ratingone Doesn t seem to be a google product 
len ratingone Switching to landscape and back to portrait mode shortens the page width by 
len ratingone Sometimes on websites like GitLab com clicking on a button trigger click on somewhere else 
len ratingone Please fix these issues
len ratingfive I have had the app for several months now and I am really enjoying it 
len ratingfour i use chrome as my main browser on my computer and my phone but on my phone something goes wrong and it closes all the tabs i have at least once a week and its really annoying cause i may be able to get back my normal tabs my incognito tabs i can never get back
len ratingone What is that saying not secure I got a virus
len ratingfive I can search anything i want I learned how to make a noob on mobile also
len ratingfive It s very handy you can use it for many things and it really helped me
len ratingtwo Can no longer easily switch between tabs on my iPhone XR 
len ratingtwo I try and it auto opens whichever tab is in the top left corner without giving me a chance to select 
len ratingtwo Also slow and laggy now 
len ratingtwo Has been this way for about months I would say 
len ratingtwo Finally over it and switching to a different browser 
len ratingtwo What gives google 
len ratingfive I love it because I have sreen lock and chrome dose not lock thxs
len ratingtwo So overall Google chrome is good for working and watching anime but it shuts down WAY to much and honestly I m sick and tired of it so pls fix it 
len ratingone You can t even paste weblinks into the url bar 
len ratingone Awful software app 
len ratingone Unfortunate 
len ratingthree On the recent IOS update I ve had issues with connectivity to the internet while using Gmail 
len ratingthree Cause when I get an email and tap on it to go to the chrome browser it doesn t respond 
len ratingthree Only when I refresh my iphone by putting it into airplane mode does it work 
len ratingthree So I would ask to update chrome to remedy this I would appreciate it

len ratingone The new update is awful and not user friendly at all 
len ratingone Can you update please
len ratingtwo  Chrome has been nightmare to use for the past few months at first I continued using it thinking maybe you guys are going to notice or maybe other people are going to complain and we ll get an update or something but for the past three I ve been waiting 
len ratingtwo My main problem is when my phone accidentally goes into landscape mode the app crashes and pushes everything to the right and then when I try to undo it by flipping the phone again and flipping it back it brings edges around the the text and brings everything to the middle and then pushes everything to the lest again 
len ratingtwo Another problem is on my asus zenbook version 
len ratingtwo The chrome app is acting so strange I can t acces the google apps from a new tab because it keeps logging me out but on the little top bar where it shows my profile and where the bookmarks are it shows I m logged in 
len ratingtwo I have many gmails and google different settings on my accounts so the little circle you can use to switch between accounts is very important 
len ratingtwo Both chrome on my iPhone and my laptop are acting very weird and I hope and update can come out soon cause I love using them and have so much information saved in my accounts
len ratingone Normal things don t work 
len ratingone Help docs don t match up 
len ratingone Terrible quality 
len ratingfive  Whatever
len ratingone The app is terrible
len ratingthree Everytime my screen rotates whatever webpage I m on shrinks and doesn t fill the screen and the only way to fix it is to close it from multi tasking and relaunch the app plz fix this has been a issue for a long time honestly shocked Google hasn t noticed or has continued to not fix it it s been almost months since their last update come on we know you have the resources to fix this
len ratingone When I rotate my iPhone to landscape view and rotate back to portrait it squishes the page to about the width of the screen and I can t get it to go back to normal without closing the app altogether 
len ratingone Major flaw in the programming and very annoying 
len ratingthree Every time I go into landscape mode and go back to portrait mode the whole page becomes smaller then I have to close the whole app in order to get it back to normal 
len ratingfour Great app wish it had widgets 
len ratingfour the actual google app has it why can t chrome 
len ratingone I have traditionally used Chrome as my go to web browser across all my Apple devices 
len ratingone Recently Chrome doesn t display web pages properly on iOS 
len ratingone When moving from portrait to landscape and vice versa the page becomes skewed and difficult to operate 
len ratingone The only fix is to close the affected tab and reopen the page 
len ratingone I d like to change my rating once this issue is resolved 
len ratingone  They deleted another review now surprised how lazy the app keeps opening on pages I ve closed 
len ratingone It s been doing that since last year 
len ratingone As a teacher I have always suggested students use chrome BECAUSE they were easy with the simulations through Adobe flash 
len ratingone Now I have to switch over to a different browser and redo AGAIN all my lessons 
len ratingone Don t rely on google they will let you down 
len ratingone I was hoping this app would be better than safari both interface wise and performance wise but exploring it was such a pain No obvious way to switch tabs GUI is hard to navigate and an overall pain to figure out 
len ratingone For a year old who spends most of his time on technology this shouldn t be a problem but something about this just didn t work right at all
len ratingone I was trying to get desktop mode to access settings I can t get to on gmail mobile but of course there is none 
len ratingone This proves once again that Google developers are nothing more than retarded code monkeys 
len ratingtwo This app used to be my go to browser for years and years 
len ratingtwo Recently it has been terrible 
len ratingtwo Captchas not loading sites crashing text not completely loading 
len ratingtwo It s constant 
len ratingtwo What is going on 
len ratingfive  Identity theft and accounts compromised by android software developer hacking iPhone devices
len ratingone Several websites that worked fine in a previous version now never fit the window 
len ratingone I either have to hope I can scroll down to see the full page or go the the website and restart chrome 
len ratingone Also I get stuck zoomed into images even on google images
len ratingone Please fix the iOS margin bug 
len ratingfour I was trying to download an extension and it said I needed to update google chrome to download the extension 
len ratingfour So I went to the App Store and there is no available updates 
len ratingfour I m a little confused but that s the only issue I ve ever had with this app 
len ratingfour It s really good I m general 
len ratingfive asi disfrutare bueno pa al google
len ratingfive When will Apple release version 
len ratingfive Every other platform has updated it and there are zero day bugs out there that we are exposed to until Apple gets around to offering version for iOS 
len ratingfive I even have it on my Mac Mini so it s not Google s fault 
len ratingfive UPDATE ALREADY 
len ratingthree This happens on iPhone Pro Max 
len ratingthree It sounds like a small issue and easy fix but never gets fixed 
len ratingone Google AMP is so pointless 
len ratingone It gets in the way and doesn t help with anything 
len ratingone It s a nuisance 
len ratingone Make it a feature the user can turn off or get rid of it all together 
len ratingone I always use google chrome but now it seems very frustrating while switching the tabs 
len ratingone It keeps switching and selecting things I don t want 
len ratingone This app crashes a lot everytime i leave the app it crashes
len ratingfive I like it
len ratingtwo Having my web page shrink below the standard width is highly annoying 
len ratingtwo Fix this already 
len ratingone There is a bug that messes up the margins in webpages when you rotate your device and the only solution is to close the tab 
len ratingone It makes webpages unreadable 
len ratingone The bug has been there for months now but Google doesn t update Chrome because of the new AppStore privacy policy 
len ratingone Completely unacceptable 
len ratingone Moving to Safari 
len ratingtwo In new update when U want switched between few tabs application do s me job and switch by it self
len ratingthree This used to be the best browser on IOS now it has weird glitches with tabs and they will randomly open and can t be chosen 
len ratingone Google Chrome devs has been dragging their heels not disclosing privacy facts and there have been lots of patches they could be implementing but have not 
len ratingone It s probably being overhauled before they disclose out of concern for the backlash the app would suffer if you knew how bad the data mining of users is 
len ratingone Do no evil used to be a google thing no 
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingone Google Chrome s Tabs on iOS have a limit of about that can be open I ve tested this out multiple times it s beyond pathetic 
len ratingone Once you reach it puts a ridiculous smiley face and closes you out of ALL your opened before you were even done 
len ratingone Definitely do NOT make this your Default Browser on iOS 
len ratingfour Good for watching prn u don t get hacked
len ratingfive  Chrome is an amazing and trustworthy browser 
len ratingfive Yes there may be a few bugs but overall it is very good 
len ratingfive You can sync tabs and history from other devices and the speed is very good 
len ratingfive Unlike safari which says safari could not open the page because the server connection was lost Chrome is the best browser in the world and I highly recommend using it 
len ratingfour  Ok so this app is really cool 
len ratingfour It s helped me understand myself better and has helped me pass time 
len ratingfour I m really thankful for it but there are some flaws like how even though I was in incognito mode for a search and I have my google account configured so that it doesn t collect any of the sites I ve been to it kept recommending the site when I typed am I 
len ratingfour Same with other sites but this one is where I noticed it 
len ratingfour Any way I like playing dumb games on game websites and watching anime with chrome 
len ratingfour It s awesome
len ratingone It used to work great for me now it cashes and I get a this app closed unexpectedly warnings at least once a week 
len ratingone It is unstable at best incredibly frustrating and unreliable 
len ratingfive Anyone else get chrome for hentai 
len ratingfive  Lol I can watch YouTube anytime now If you delete and reinstall you can t see the time that you ve done I ve found a loophole 
len ratingone Chrome won t work with any captcha
len ratingfive Junk 
len ratingone  Sold out and just not worth using them 
len ratingone Can t be trusted 
len ratingthree I have downloaded this onto my iPad but when I am in one of my apps it says that I need to download chrome even though I already did I am going to leave this at a three star rate because I do not know if this is just my iPad 
len ratingthree I m sure that the devs are working on something but in case they re not 
len ratingthree The issue of not filling the screen is also present in the iPhone XR 
len ratingthree It s super frustrating 
len ratingthree I love this browser but the sooner this is fixed the better 
len ratingtwo Every time I rotate my phone weather on purpose or on accident the window will shrink to a third of the size rendering it unusable 
len ratingtwo Until this is fixed I m stuck with safari 
len ratingtwo Would be stars if not for this bug 
len ratingthree  Yes Google and Apple are competitors and maybe I shouldn t expect seamless integration of Google apps on an iPhone 
len ratingthree But if Google has been able to create iOS widgets for its calendar and mail maybe they could find a way to create a save website on screen option with Chrome like safari can 
len ratingthree I use a lot of cooking websites that do not have their own apps to access them easily I save their home pages on my phone screen as Safari websites 
len ratingthree Would be much nicer to be able to do this with Chrome instead 
len ratingthree Would be great to take this one step further ability to create a Chrome widget stack for iOS screen that can easily scroll thru various websites I use often 
len ratingthree As I ve commented before Read later option is appreciated but needs to be taken further provide folders and a direct way to create a bookmark without revisiting the page 
len ratingtwo  Chrome seems to fail to register when I close out a tab 
len ratingtwo Whenever I close a tab out and then close the app the tab I previously closed reappears when I reopen the app 
len ratingthree I was on mesanger to call but I had to install chrome
len ratingfour Every time I leave my google alone for a few minutes when my phone is unlocked it resets is self and all of my tabs are gone after that and it s annoying so can you please fix that please
len ratingone Minimize the browser and then bring it back up and all of the sudden the page content doesn t stretch to of the browser window anymore 
len ratingone Happens every single time 
len ratingone  Have you ever heard of something called an update 
len ratingone It s happened twice in month my taps just closed i hate trying figure out what i had previously open as well I loved that they didn t close back then I had over taps and they were all working fine Google please fix this
len ratingone Worse every day cmon man 
len ratingone You are supposed to be a leader
len ratingfour It s great it helps me do my schoolwork and other stuff like that I would give this a four dollar has a little bit of bags it s great
len ratingfour Nice this is probably a replica of safari I just want to say it is a nice app Rain
len ratingone This has a bug on the iPhone mini where it resizes to the left side of the screen if the screen goes to sleep and you wake it back up 
len ratingone On a mini that makes it really hard to use and it s obnoxious 
len ratingone Guess I have to find a different browser 
len ratingone  It used to work good but now it deletes all of my tabs 
len ratingone I can t even restore them and everyone I get on the app it crashes 
len ratingone Fix your glitches and bugs ASAP 
len ratingone Every time I accidentally click update all apps i end up hating myself 
len ratingone Most recent update replaced the bottom search key with a new tab button which is just awful 
len ratingfive  TYSM CHROME YOUR LETTING ME WATCH YOUTUBE WHEN I HAVE SCREEN TIME ON IT SO YEA TY
len ratingtwo No matter how many or how little tabs are open it ll constantly crash to the point of being unable to retrieve important tabs 
len ratingtwo I m sick of this 
len ratingtwo Space isn t an issue as I have GB available
len ratingone After updating to iOS Chrome has become garbage 
len ratingone It freezes crashes and doesn t give option to restore pages consistently 
len ratingone I tried updating the Chrome app only to find out Google doesn t update iOS apps anymore because of the privacy scandal 
len ratingone Oh and the update force closed my open tabs with no option to restore 
len ratingone I literally have no reason to use Chrome anymore 
len ratingone Why are Google and Apple shooting themselves in the foot 
len ratingone F k planned obsolescence 
len ratingtwo I can t bring myself to support Google any longer as I m more and more becoming aware that information and news is being filtered on their platforms 
len ratingtwo I don t agree with censorship in any context and refuse to support a corporate entity that engages in such behaviors 
len ratingtwo If you lock your phone and come back the window gets white bars down the sides and everything gets screwy super annoying
len ratingfive Love it the only thing I wish it would do is open mail links in Chrome instead of Safari 
len ratingfive  Using the default mail app on iPhone 
len ratingthree  Why is it still blackout my screen after crash even if i close the app already 
len ratingthree I have to restart the device again
len ratingthree  I have a practically new sixth generation iPad bought through my Broadband Carrier 
len ratingthree Is this a substandard or downgraded model 
len ratingthree I ask because Chrome will not respond to System double tap to increase Font size nor is a non Amp page from Google Search offered which might lend itself to Font increase 
len ratingthree This is the version of the iPad which seems to have touch screen insensitivity issues SUGGESTION Can you offer to Translate AMP pages into a larger Font 
len ratingone Every time I use chrome in landscape mode after going back to portrait the webpage size shrinks and there is no way to return it to its normal size 
len ratingone The only thing I can do is close the tab and open the same webpage in a new tab 
len ratingone This is annoying and has been happening for some time now 
len ratingthree Please please PLEASE add an restore tabs button 
len ratingthree I was doing something on my google chrome and then i accidently clicked the x on my computer and the tabs are now gone 
len ratingthree Please add it 
len ratingthree I m so upset and unhappy with you not adding a button like this 
len ratingthree Please its just one button and i ll be happy again 
len ratingone Chrome keeps instantly switching to another tab when I click the tab icon 
len ratingone Utter garbage and useless app 
len ratingone Thought it was a connection issue but everything loads just fine in safari 
len ratingone The app crashes 
len ratingone I m onto your Google I no longer use any Google products or have any Google apps on my phone 
len ratingone You are shady and will never conduct good business practices when it comes to your customers information 
len ratingone Bye bye
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone What s with all the bugs and no fix 
len ratingone It didn t used to be like this chrome worked so well with everything 
len ratingone It wasn t until a year ago or so when they updated it and there are multiple bugs that make it kind of frustrating to use 
len ratingone My biggest gripe is when you are on a website and you flip your phone horizontal and it changes the viewing angle and then flip it back and it rotates the screen again 
len ratingone But now the screen is stuck zoomed halfway out 
len ratingone I am on an iPhone and this bug even worked when I was on the 
len ratingone This applies to every webpage even Google s 
len ratingone At this point I m simply dumbfounded they haven t fixed such a common issue many other people complain and say they have this bug and find it shows a lack of care for their product 
len ratingone I will be switching at least until this is rectified 
len ratingfive I love it but I hate when it says invalid response received pls youtube fix that
len ratingtwo I can t even use the app any more after updating it just locks up on me
len ratingthree I like chrome and used it a lot but Google Fix the errors and add a way to open recently closed tabs in your history or I stop using this and turn the review into a star
len ratingone This is just a skin IOS made but your still technically using safari a 
len ratingone This is highly frustrating as the plug ins that I want to use refuse to work 
len ratingone That s just lying 
len ratingone You ar
len ratingfour I wish I could four and half star
len ratingtwo When are you guys going to fix this issue of the screen shrinking for no reason
len ratingtwo  Google chrome is no account switch please fix
len ratingthree So the app is great and all but it s laggy and too slow 
len ratingthree So I always have to delete tabs in open tabs again 
len ratingthree I hope this won t happen again 
len ratingone What s wrong google 
len ratingone You haven t updated in two months now 
len ratingone this is the best gam ever
len ratingtwo The Newest Update is frustrating 
len ratingtwo Whenever I exited the app and close it and I wanna come back then my tabs are gone 
len ratingtwo It s like an another window 
len ratingtwo The android version is doing fine but the iOS is buggy 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome for IOS 
len ratingone Now it hangs and crashes regularly 
len ratingone I ve deleted it and reinstalled it several times it helps for a short while but the fix is only temporary 
len ratingtwo I always liked chrome until the recent bugs occured 
len ratingtwo It is so frustrating to see that many famous websites are glitching on an ipad 
len ratingtwo For example pipedrive just wouldnt scroll down 
len ratingtwo The same happens on safari but not on a firefox 
len ratingtwo Firefox works with pipedrive normally and would scroll down all pages 
len ratingtwo Basically Chrome is not a desktop class browser no matter if you are using big ipad pro or a small one 
len ratingtwo Another big issue with chrome is autofill of passwords 
len ratingtwo Tried everything clear cache reinstall the app restart ipad but nothing stored passwords just wont autofill 
len ratingone I love you guys so much but the new update is bad I can t get stuff because of it
len ratingtwo Almost unusable 
len ratingtwo They have completely lost the ability to keep a website zoomed in correctly on your device 
len ratingtwo iPad and iPhone the same 
len ratingtwo If you go to horizontal landscape view and then rotate back to portrait the entire thing is thrown off 
len ratingtwo You can t zoom it back into proportion either you have to reload the entire page 
len ratingtwo When dealing with page is there less than perfect for phone viewing it s just downright frustrating 
len ratingtwo Starting to use Safari of all things full time now 
len ratingtwo Hope you guys figure it out
len ratingone I been using good chrome for years or more have never had a problem till so last year I left chrome to use safari then I came back to google chrome to see if they fixed the problem first few weeks no problem then book closed all my important tabs 
len ratingone I m gone google if you can t fix this then you ll slowly start losing clients because of this crap
len ratingthree I love everything about Chrome minus one very annoying bug 
len ratingthree When you rotate your phone sideways it goes horizontal 
len ratingthree Great that s what I wanted 
len ratingthree Rotating back it actually squishes the webpage and you cannot fix it 
len ratingthree Please fix this Google 
len ratingone  Outdated as Google refuses to update IOS versions of their apps
len ratingone Your app is taking way too much time to download
len ratingfive What about the security provided in the most recent update that was so important 
len ratingfive Still love it but I want to be current 
len ratingone No updates in over two months now 
len ratingone Makes me wonder why they don t want us to know what data they re tracking 
len ratingone For a company which has always been seemingly a front runner for security updates this is not acceptable 
len ratingone Google apps are going away until they start behaving responsibly again 
len ratingone This worthless app has crashed on me multiple times and each time it doesn t allow me to recover the closed tabs even though they claim you should be able to 
len ratingone I ve lost all my data multiple times because of this 
len ratingone Don t waste your time with this junk just use a different internet browser 
len ratingone There can t be any that are much worse than chrome 
len ratingone  With no updates in months it looks like I will be deleting Google apps as glitchy security risks 
len ratingone It s been a nice run but apparently Google is more concerned about revealing it s scretchy ways via Apple new rules revealing what an app is really doing 
len ratingone Message received Google thanks for letting us know what we should have known all along Google is untrustworthy and knows it so it won t update and reveal the truth 
len ratingtwo There are many bugs and issues 
len ratingtwo but one of the most annoying and constant experienced is when I zoom into the page out and the page glitches and doesn t fill onto my whole screen leaving a gray bar on the right that will not go away for any tab 
len ratingtwo The only way to reset it is to close and reopen the app 
len ratingtwo This has been a problem for months and has yet to be fixed
len ratingone  IM GONNA CRY LMAOAOOAA WHY IS IT 
len ratingfive Google is better than safari I know their kinda the same but Safari gave me viruses for reading A BOOK 
len ratingfive Any tips on how to remove them 
len ratingfive This is the best thing ever I can search up stuff with out all the things popping up love this so much
len ratingone I have removed all Google apps since Ethel have not updated them going on months 
len ratingone I suspect this is due to Apples new privacy policies 
len ratingone Since the apps have not been update it s concerning what patches are not being applied 
len ratingone A bunch of annoying little things that make using the browser much more of a frustrating experience
len ratingtwo Why when I install the Chrome program the auto fill password section in the sting section has a problem hangs 
len ratingfive The best app to use during downtime
len ratingone Noticed this hasn t been updated in months yet there s been many many changes in the OSS repo for the iOS port 
len ratingone Hope none of those changes are security fixes 
len ratingone been messed up since last year 
len ratingone I will edit when it has been resolved
len ratingone Noticeably annoying issue when scrolling that brings a page to its side rather than smooth vertical scrolling 
len ratingone When using the browser if I turn my phone into landscape mode and then turn it back the sizing is all screwed up 
len ratingone I m surprised this isn t fixed yet 
len ratingone It s been doing this for awhile now 
len ratingfive I need help can you help me please please thank you so so much
len ratingfive At least It performs way better than the stock compass that comes with all apple devices 
len ratingfive  helps me with everything and most of the time has what i need 
len ratingfive Without this i would have a harder life tyyy 
len ratingtwo Oh my God I m trying to change my banner there for my YouTube channel One problem is in the past that I didn t had a banner picture so it did not show anything out So I took the tutorial and it said I had to download this app I already hate the new YouTube studios because it doesn t have any customary binder it s so annoying not only that I didn t even have it in desktop mode every time I try to change into my other email you guys wouldn t allow me until I deleted that email Account The size is just wrong it s always going from so small each time I m going to YouTube studios and trying to fix the Banner I just download the app and it s already glitching only give it to stars because I didn t really mind one
len ratingtwo In the latest update the pull to refresh function cannot be removed 
len ratingtwo It is bothersome 
len ratingtwo As I simply try to a croll to the top of my webpage it refreshes and I lose all of the work that I have just completed on the page 
len ratingfive I only use it for the offline Dino game 
len ratingfive Nothing else 
len ratingfive Use google instead 
len ratingthree I love Chrome it is usually my browser of choice on iPhone or PC 
len ratingthree However there is a persistent bug that is driving me crazy and who knows when it will be fixed 
len ratingthree Every time I go to navigate to another tab instead of staying on the tiled library of my tabs to choose from it will automatically pick one at random and go to it instead 
len ratingthree It s extremely frustrating 
len ratingthree I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and keep waiting for an update that will fix it in vain 
len ratingthree May have to switch to Edge if this doesn t resolve soon 
len ratingfive OMG THIS WEBSITE IS SO LIT MAN
len ratingone Chrome does not size correctly on iPhone 
len ratingone The bottom bar is halfway below the edge of the screen 
len ratingone It makes it very difficult to use the app 
len ratingone I didn t see any issue before today 
len ratingone  Hey there 
len ratingone Check steps here 
len ratingone If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingtwo UI and sync is really nice but scaling goes crazy when switching between vertical and horizontal also scrolling bars very often appear in the middle of the screen especially in horizontal view 
len ratingtwo Requesting desktop versio 
len ratingtwo Of a webpage either does not work or gives very bad results 
len ratingtwo I thought Google had better developers 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome but they haven t been fixing blatant margin issues on iPhone 
len ratingone Seems like it s been going on almost a year and they haven t done anything about it 
len ratingone I switched to Edge and am happy so far 
len ratingfour The find in page feature is xririxal why bury it at the bottom of a scrolly hamburger menu 
len ratingfour Chrome for iOS would be way better if you could just tap the omnibar to search inside the page you re viewing 
len ratingfour Also the find in page feature really ought to work on PDFs 
len ratingfour Users must transfer potentially massive files to different apps just to search in a Google app 
len ratingtwo  I ve got viruses on my phone sure I watch ph a lot but still if we can send a man to the moon we should be able to stop a virus on earth
len ratingfive It s like literally the best app ever
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingthree So frustrating to not be able to switch accounts I like to be able to access different bookmarks for work and personal and I just can t 
len ratingone When rotating the screen it screws up how the pages are displayed especially after rotating it back 
len ratingone Suddenly margins appear 
len ratingone Edge is a way better browser try that 
len ratingone I know what Google s response will be clear the cache Do you know how much trouble i have to go through every time i clear the cache 
len ratingone It s a pain to have to enter everything in forms again and remember all my passwords when today you can t even remember your passwords anymore because every site has different stupid password complexity requirements 
len ratingone After an IOS Update something web pages will not load correctly 
len ratingone When you open the page the contents will not fill the screen 
len ratingone The page is about of the screen 
len ratingone I researched the issue to no resolve 
len ratingone Started using another search engine that works flawlessly 
len ratingthree Page width issues since last update 
len ratingone Wow it s been bad for a few months for me now 
len ratingone I always have the same few tabs open 
len ratingone When I go into chrome it will always reload those tabs then reload again 
len ratingone And again 
len ratingone And again 
len ratingone When I m at the screen that shows what tabs are open the webpage will show random boxes being highlighted and it will cycle thru like I m hovering over it with a mouse 
len ratingone But I m on a phone so what the 
len ratingone I ll also be on a site minimize chrome text someone real quick 
len ratingone Go back to chrome and it s already wanting to refresh 
len ratingone That might be an iOS issue I guess but it did not do this for me until a few months ago 
len ratingone I have a feeling good ol google is just waiting to update until they figure out the verbiage to use for their privacy hoarding 
len ratingone I ll still use it though since safari is awful 
len ratingone The viewport resizes constantly I can only see of the content while the right side of the viewport is just white 
len ratingone Fix this 
len ratingone Everyone please blast the reviews for this app until they fix the landscape issue 
len ratingone Talking about how the apps margins getting jacked up anytime you tilt the phone
len ratingone  I used to love the chrome app and all but the new update had just made it along with google and safari very bad and I mean like painfully bad 
len ratingone One you can try to search deviantart a perfect social media art community and it will appear but it will act like it s gone for good 
len ratingone I try to search some of the sites I like to search but they don t even appear 
len ratingone It just acts like it doesn t even know the site and just asks if I wrote something incorrect 
len ratingone I wrote the thing correctly and it still says the same thing 
len ratingone Even on images and videos 
len ratingone I just want the old update back 
len ratingone The old one before this new and very annoying update that just came out 
len ratingone it doesn t clear the browsing history
len ratingthree Chrome now has a constant issue with going from vertical to horizontal then back to vertical views 
len ratingthree When turning the phone sideways to watch a video then back to up and down the page and all future pages have an issue where they don t expand to the full screen 
len ratingthree This is consistent every time 
len ratingthree You have to close and reopen the app to fix 
len ratingthree Switching to Safari soon if not fixed since it is so consistently an issue 
len ratingthree iPhone iOS 
len ratingone The content randomly gets resized when rotating your device or sometimes while browsing normally 
len ratingone This makes it impossible to read articles as it will resize to of the screen out of nowhere 
len ratingone Aw Snap Can t open this page Something went wrong Chrome didn t shut down correctly hard reset rinse and repeat 
len ratingfive Chrome has been my go to browser for at least a decade 
len ratingfive I m not a Bing fan or Safari I used to use Firefox but it failed many years ago 
len ratingfive I ll use Safari when I have too many Chrome tabs open multi tasking nerd 
len ratingfive I m not understanding other reviews that say that Chrome doesn t work 
len ratingfive I ve found it to be flawless for YEARS 
len ratingtwo This is a small but very annoying feature of your application unless I have the sideways flip function turned off if I have one of your page is open and my phone has to turn sideways it creates a very narrow aspect ratio of the page that s impossible for it to go away unless I exit out and create a new page again this is not a very terrible feature but as soon as I use your Internet browser for almost everything it makes it very complicated when I need the sideways function on This only happens with Google Chrome
len ratingtwo Been months since google fixed the most annoying and easy to fix bug 
len ratingtwo Landscape breaks the page layout until force close 
len ratingtwo Thanks google 
len ratingtwo We get it 
len ratingtwo You hate apple 
len ratingthree I don t know what this issue is I have used a computer to turn off safe search as well as my mobile browser and neither option seems to work my safe search is permanently on and will not turn off no matter how many times I change the settings and click save 
len ratingthree I am years and cannot change my adult content restrictions 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingthree I love chrome but the reason i deduct two stars is because everytime i update my ipad for some reason all of my tabs are closed 
len ratingthree Until you fix this I will use safari and you should too
len ratingone  Recently has been terribly bugged won t open pages takes forever to load back button doesn t work
len ratingtwo Chrome had a lot going for it but when they removed the ability for users to stop the annoying sound and videos that automatically play on way too many websites I quit 
len ratingtwo I used to use it for the syncing ability but now Firefox has all the same extensions and syncs history between mobile and PC and tablet just as well 
len ratingfive  Can you please put Google chrome on my iPad Please Bridget Lapka
len ratingfive Dinosaur game go brrrrrr
len ratingtwo I use Chrome on my iMac solely because of the multi user function 
len ratingtwo I switch back and forth on my desktop very easily dozens of times a day and everything is beautifully arranged for personal and work just the way I like it 
len ratingtwo Safari does not have that function 
len ratingtwo However I cannot use this great multi profile feature on my iPhone it only lets me connect one profile at a time making it a huge pain 
len ratingtwo I end up using Chrome for work and Safari for personal 
len ratingtwo Would x prefer to use Chrome for both just like I do on my desktop 
len ratingone For some reason everything doesn t fit the screen 
len ratingone If go to a website nothings fits if rotate the screen nothing fits 
len ratingone  It s so evil it closes all my tabs and now I can t open them again
len ratingone It freezes and loses my tabs 
len ratingone No other browsers do this just import your bookmarks settings to Firefox
len ratingone Whenever I need something I search it up and yet Chrome doesn t show any of that and even deletes tabs even if it s simply or 
len ratingone Fix the problem of deleting both tabs and history bookmarks and read later 
len ratingone The later shouldn t even be deleted since they re there to seen later 
len ratingthree My user names and passwords are missing one letter when I logout and login again I have to recorrect 
len ratingtwo I ve been primarily using safari as my browser for mobile devices and the buttons surrounding just seem overly clunky they don t seem to blend with the browser experience very well 
len ratingtwo Not sure if I just got used to safaris browser 
len ratingtwo Switching browsers seem unintuitive as well showing as grid 
len ratingtwo Could be just a setting but defaulting to something taking up all the real estate seems backwards
len ratingtwo My google account was disabled and I wanted to restore my account but it would not let me
len ratingtwo When it works awesome 
len ratingtwo Half the time pages dont load properly and they re unreadable 
len ratingone I was hoping they would take this out with an update but Google seems to be sticking by this silly update 
len ratingone It is so infuriating if I wanted the last page I was on to reopen I never would have closed it 
len ratingone I don t see why going back to it opening on the google Home Screen is so difficult 
len ratingone  I had enough with passcode warning 
len ratingone Best way to solve it deleted the app 
len ratingfive Bla bla
len ratingfive I would say this browser app is really good 
len ratingfive I usually do this app for bout to hours and chrome because this is a browser and stuff like that I think this is a good app 
len ratingtwo I always use chrome over every other app out there but ever since the new update when my phone turns to the side and makes the screen smaller which is unbelievably annoying I can t stand it 
len ratingtwo I have to close the entire window and open a new one again and god forbid I forget to turn on screen lock I have to repeat the process again 
len ratingtwo Please fix this I m using safari and want chrome back
len ratingone Works great on an iPhone but crashes within second on an iPad 
len ratingone Every time I use chrome for some reason the screen will resize and become smaller then shift to the left side of my screen 
len ratingone So whatever website I go to it won t take up the whole screen and there will be a small white gap on the right side 
len ratingone It is incredibly annoying and only goes away by exiting whatever tab I have open and making a new one 
len ratingone But it still keeps happening and it s very frustrating 
len ratingone Please make the app screen constraints work properly 
len ratingone Inappropriate content
len ratingthree Since few day the page size varies the from the screen size 
len ratingthree I have to reopen the app to fix it
len ratingfive Well I wish you had YouTube with no ads like brave and opera plz do that XD LOL that s the only thing baii 
len ratingone Deleting reviews
len ratingone Total garbage 
len ratingone Y all know why and what I m talking about 
len ratingone Very buggy as of late 
len ratingone No update for months 
len ratingone What s up 
len ratingone Chrome is very bad on my phone I can t use it to browse
len ratingtwo I am a mobile chrome user myself and have alwayd delt with the same problem I have an iphone which by itself is a kind of small phone so when it comes to the size of the screen its gonna be tough 
len ratingtwo But safari and other search engines have a zoom setting in the app or in the working tab I know there is a text zoom setting on chrome but that only makes the text smaller that doesnt resolve the issue lets say for example I wanted to read an article 
len ratingtwo The page on chrome was too small to read parts of the article and i couldnt zoom out it would just stay still and make the page go backwards if that makes sense 
len ratingtwo Developers of chrome please make a zoom page button where you can make the page more spacious Thank you 
len ratingone Horrible people behind a nameless corporate face 
len ratingone Terrible app that harvests data 
len ratingone You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
len ratingone violation of free speech by removing bad reviews from Robinhood app 
len ratingthree Make it more accessible with ios
len ratingone Chrome on my iPhone iOS has issues with the pages displaying large margins after rotating or reloading 
len ratingone This has been an issue from day one onward 
len ratingtwo I ve even switched to an iPhone but he still gets in and loves to mess with my chrome 
len ratingtwo Can never get help from here 
len ratingtwo Articles I don t want nor understand 
len ratingtwo Now come in thin panel so even harder to read 
len ratingtwo Can t even get an attorney 
len ratingtwo He s blocked my sending with insecure sites 
len ratingtwo Changes to bogus sites 
len ratingtwo Unhooked my gmail to chrome 
len ratingtwo Changes things to phony images 
len ratingtwo And now says it s hooked to Mac and not my iPhone and can t get in 
len ratingtwo Also turned off Java script 
len ratingtwo So tired off apps like this helping them learn things to hurt but not being there to help other customers 
len ratingtwo Other wise yay 
len ratingtwo Great app
len ratingthree  Okay app kinda creepy sometimes
len ratingtwo Removing authentic consumer complaints for monetary gain 
len ratingtwo Should be investigated 
len ratingthree When I m using Google Chrome for iOS on my iPhone Pro Max if I tilt the screen from portrait to landscape and back to portrait the app shows margins on both sides that shrink any webpage I m using 
len ratingthree Then scrolling down causes the margin on the left to shift to the right making the webpage offset to the left 
len ratingone Google has made their stance on the American caste system 
len ratingone They have recently taken part in an open seditious act against the middle and lower class all around the world 
len ratingone I m sure you ve heard by now of the Wall Street vs Main Street incident 
len ratingone It s still ongoing 
len ratingone Google has helped the Robinhood app by deleting over negative reviews to make it appear that the app is well liked 
len ratingone It is not 
len ratingone Google and Robinhood are united under one goal to keep the rich rich and keep the poor poor 
len ratingone Do not download 
len ratingone Do not use 
len ratingone Use DuckDuckGo instead 
len ratingone Terrible people removing free speech 
len ratingone Deleting reviews on Robinhood 
len ratingone Those were honest and truthful reviews 
len ratingone Your motto start off with don t be evil 
len ratingone Now it be as evil as you can
len ratingone  They remove start reviews to take away the people s voice 
len ratingone If you see this before they take it down please rate low they won t be able to keep up with all of us
len ratingone Google is trying to strip our st amendment rights 
len ratingone They removed over star reviews of robinhood 
len ratingone Hey google remember when your slogan was don t be evil 
len ratingone How s that going for you 
len ratingone I bet google will delete this comment too 
len ratingone Down with this monopoly and the 
len ratingone  Google is hindering free speech and changing reviews 
len ratingone They only like reviews and speech that fits their agenda 
len ratingone If your using their apps they are most certainly spying on you and looking through your phone and device cameras 
len ratingone  Manipulation of market and silencing free thinkers 
len ratingone We are not to be betrayed 
len ratingone Shame on you Google
len ratingone They delete reviews that they don t like 
len ratingone Terribly unethical company 
len ratingone Otherwise great app 
len ratingone Aiding in the act of market manipulation by using your platform to silence others 
len ratingone Shameful you were the chosen one 
len ratingone It said you were sworn to destroy evil not join them 
len ratingone The interface is lacking can t turn certain things off and anytime I do a search it ends up on Facebook for some reason 
len ratingone Use some one like DuckDuckGo 
len ratingone They don t track your searches and don t censor or rewrite reviews 
len ratingone Run so slowly on your phone
len ratingone So scummy to delete negative reviews on robinhood
len ratingone The most invasive and hypocritical app on the App Store 
len ratingone If you value personal freedom and civil liberty this is not the app for you 
len ratingfive As you may read the title I am obviously obsessed with this APP 
len ratingfive I use it for school tests homework math science stories subtraction addition all that kind of stuff and when you search who is the best man in the world it will say Prophet Muhammad SAW is the best man in the world I just love that and I am Muslim and it does anything you want 
len ratingfive It can even go back to 
len ratingfive You just type something you want to know and boom 
len ratingfive The answer comes right up 
len ratingfive You can even search for images like Anime base Fish Parts when was crying invented anime hair anime head eyes even PRODUCTS YOU CAN BUY ONLINE 
len ratingtwo I don t know if this is the case for all iPhone models but at least on mine every once in a while the browser will constrict the webpage as if I zoomed out making things more difficult to see and read 
len ratingtwo The only way to fix it seems to be to tap the URL and press enter 
len ratingtwo Just a normal refresh won t do it 
len ratingtwo It wasn t like this until very recently so I think something got messed up in the latest version 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingone They silence the reviews of the many to benefit the few 
len ratingone The sell your information to ad companies to profit themselves 
len ratingone The manipulate the information to push agenda politics 
len ratingone F big tech 
len ratingone I m
len ratingone We are waiting for you to add your privacy details Google 
len ratingone Can you update the apps that steal the most information so we can see what you are taking and selling to the highest bidder 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone I ll just use safari instead 
len ratingone Apple doesn t remove my reviews like the big G does 
len ratingone Google is removing reviews and so they needed to be removed 
len ratingone Just now the app crashed and the restore button would not register I was touching it then it crashed again and boom over tabs up to years old GONE 
len ratingone All of them 
len ratingone I can t believe this junk app just destroyed tabs I ve had for YEARS 
len ratingone Seeing a thread on chrome community where everyone had the same thing happen 
len ratingone If you don t restore our tabs you stole I ll find a new browser 
len ratingone Google doesn t want to show you how many data they get from us 
len ratingone Update your privacy badge rn google 
len ratingone Removing bad reviews from Robinhood app is a form of silencing the public 
len ratingone This is America free speech all day 
len ratingtwo Stop censoring bad reviews they deserve it
len ratingone Every time I try to sync with my google account I have to go to gmail to verify it but when I come back it says that something went wrong and I have to put in all the information with my google account all over again 
len ratingone Removed reviews 
len ratingone Anti free speech
len ratingone Google has abused millions of people suppressed the rights of Americans and pushes their agenda down each of our throats by banning Parlor targeting Redditor s apart of the GameStop Wall street scenario amp canceling Right Wing individuals 
len ratingone Google is corrupt to the highest degree and they will fall due to their own evil corruption 
len ratingone Crashes constantly
len ratingone This application is hard to use and I would not recommend anybody download this application or Robinhood 
len ratingthree  I ve been using the mobile version of Chrome ever since it came out 
len ratingthree I loved it 
len ratingthree It was always super quick it was familiar and easy to use and you can use your plugins with it 
len ratingthree It wasn t until recently when things went downhill 
len ratingthree There are so many bugs with it now and some that have been there for literally half a year that have been left unaddressed 
len ratingthree From a massive company like Google you d think they try to fix these issues right 
len ratingthree Well if I rotate my phone the window just will not work for me 
len ratingthree It will shrink the size and just be incredibly frustrating to use 
len ratingthree This bug has been with me since SEPTEMBER of 
len ratingthree Four months this issue has been here and the Chrome forum FAQ is reporting the same issue 
len ratingthree It has not been fixed and I feel like they haven t even attempted to fix it 
len ratingthree I had to move back to Safari because it s just not full of bugs and issues 
len ratingthree I really like Chrome for a lot of reasons but when bugs and other issues have been left unfixed for this long it s just not worth my time anymore 
len ratingthree Once these bugs are fixed this will be back on top but in the meantime I d recommend to not waste your time and energy using this browser 
len ratingone Helping robinhood erase bad reviews due to the manipulation herewecome
len ratingone deleting star robinhood reviews huh 
len ratingone  GME TO THA MF MOON 
len ratingone Google is censoring what you see
len ratingone  Google is using its power to manipulate and hide Robinhood s criminal activity 
len ratingone What they ve been doing recently to the public is unacceptable 
len ratingone I wouldn t be surprised if this review mysteriously disappeared 
len ratingfive After ordering and using several Leather cases for our Iphone Promax we have determined Bandwerk s product to be the best one manufactured in the World cosmetically quality and functionality 
len ratingfive It has protected our new purchase from breaking when accidentally dropped on the ground 
len ratingfive We highly recommend this case 
len ratingone Horrible app
len ratingone This app enables hate speech and other misinformation that is dangerous to the community 
len ratingone Colludes with other large corporations to actively hide and remove negative reviews 
len ratingone  Google removed negative user reviews from legitimate users in order to keep their business partner Robinhood from being a star app 
len ratingone Download firefox 
len ratingone Do not support such blatant unfair practices from Google 
len ratingthree  This app is really good 
len ratingthree But I have been having issues lately 
len ratingthree Whenever I go on desktop mode for YouTube it is very glitchy and it shuts down my device 
len ratingthree Another issue is that when I press to view comment section or reply it is not working and that issue has been bothering me very much 
len ratingthree Please fix these issues 
len ratingthree I will be updating this review later when another issue appears 
len ratingthree thank you 
len ratingone Bye google
len ratingone Thanks for protecting Wall Street hedge funds and silencing political opposition 
len ratingone Switching to a different company bye google
len ratingone  Google is purposely corrupting sites and eliminating your first amendment right to free speech 
len ratingone END THE CORRUPTION
len ratingone Google feels the need to pick and choose what you should see 
len ratingfour For the most part the browser works well but for several months now there s been a weird glitch where the page gets zoomed out after you switch from landscape view back to vertical 
len ratingfour You have to then press the web address input at the top and then cancel it to get the regular view of the page back 
len ratingfour It s really annoying 
len ratingfour I thought this would ve been fixed by now but like I said it s been several months 
len ratingfour It might even have been close to a year now 
len ratingone After google s stupid stunt today erasing over negative reviews of the Robinhood app it is with a sad heart that I am moving all of my chrome book marks to safari and resigning myself to having to deal with Bing as a search engine for the rest of my life 
len ratingone Thanks a lot 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingone Absolutely atrocious 
len ratingone This is the app that I trust to misuse my personal information and lie to me and others regarding negative reviews against it 
len ratingfive I don t seem to need incognito mode anymore 
len ratingfive Is there a way to disable it 
len ratingone If I could give less than one star I would 
len ratingthree Google you need to do better new issue as of iOS anytime I open up my tabs the first tab always automatically opens and I have to click tabs again to select the correct one 
len ratingthree You aren t even updating this app anymore what are your devs doing all day 
len ratingone Google removes reviews on other apps such as Robinhood 
len ratingone They therefore deserve the bad reviews 
len ratingone Robinhood
len ratingfive Why is it to use 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingone Stop censoring the people of the United States when we voice our opinions against rigged systems elections stock market 
len ratingone WE SHALL RISE AND BEGIN THE REVOLUTION
len ratingone  Title
len ratingone Yesterday Google inc deleted over negative reviews for the Robinhood app to save their rating after they shut trading down for regular people 
len ratingone If it will manage my iPad I will delete it and write a review and report this app and write a review do not download it hacked my iPad safari is better
len ratingone There are other options
len ratingone Google has recently been shown deleting reviews left on Robinhood to protect their interests after they participated in direct market manipulation and stopped people from buying stocks and forced many to sell 
len ratingone I will not support a company so entrenched in Wall Streets Pockets and I encourage others to do their research on you 
len ratingthree Google is normally really good but since Wednesday its been giving me an Error code and not letting me look up ANYTHING 
len ratingthree I use google for school and its not letting me do anything 
len ratingthree It quite irritating So I do not recommend for Iphone users 
len ratingone Not at all an app for the people 
len ratingone Stop using google
len ratingfive I love chrome
len ratingtwo The current version isn t working well on my iPhone XR 
len ratingtwo Websites I am viewing seem to shrink to width for no reason 
len ratingtwo Sites will randomly stop loading and won t load until I quit the app and restart again 
len ratingone Garbage browser aside this company deleted over negative reviews of Robinhood app 
len ratingone It looks like Google went corpo too 
len ratingone They are Against free speech
len ratingone When i go to the chrome web ON GOOGLE it doesnt let me it keeps saying i have to download it EVEN THO I HAVE THE APP YOU MUST FIX THIS IT IS ANNOYING
len ratingone Rotating the device orientation between portrait and landscape prevents content from rendering in the full screen space 
len ratingone This problem has persisted for far too long 
len ratingone And it s quite annoying on a great many websites 
len ratingone Disappointed that this hasn t been fixed 
len ratingone I wanted to install chromecast on my TV ang google did everything but instal setup Im annoyed
len ratingtwo This browser always glitches now 
len ratingtwo When I watch YouTube on chrome it will always go to the side after I stop full screen 
len ratingtwo There are other glitches now 
len ratingtwo It used to be the best browser 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue and other issues 
len ratingone I can t search anything on my chrome anymore please do something about it
len ratingone Since you can t install extensions and rely on what Google provides 
len ratingone The built in pop up blocker needs to be better 
len ratingone Maybe select how aggressive it needs to be 
len ratingone As it is now it s very weak and almost never stops popups 
len ratingthree it has been crashing for the past few days lately but everything else is good
len ratingfour When I go onto YouTube and go out of the screen in chrome it just restarts and it s so annoying can you please fix it cause it s annoying
len ratingone Can you plz fix this crash 
len ratingfour I can t really explain since my phone is in 
len ratingtwo Nothing loads properly crashes all the time I use to love chrome 
len ratingtwo Now it s the worst browser on mobile 
len ratingone I m sure Google s working constantly on improving chrome for Apple s iOS iPad OS systems 
len ratingone But until this version matches the type of experience delivered from that of its desktop class 
len ratingone I wouldn t be willing to give this thing a decent rating till then 
len ratingone I open the app on my iPad Pro in 
len ratingone  A device plenty faster than some laptops Only to face a Home Screen UI that doesn t fit my screen 
len ratingone It appears as though Google ported over the original version from iPhone 
len ratingone For some reason when I m on this app the screen will shrink and there s no fixing it unless I reload the entire app 
len ratingone Please fix bc it s rly annoying
len ratingtwo It is simple open any page specially those like Facebook Twitter style with multiple items 
len ratingtwo Now turn your phone to landscape then return to the regular portrait view 
len ratingtwo It will always make part of the screen unusable 
len ratingtwo It is extremely annoying
len ratingone Really hope this gets Dev attention 
len ratingone Past few months google chrome on iOS adds weird extra white space along both sides of most websites 
len ratingone Happens every time I switch my phone from portrait to vertical 
len ratingone Happens most websites if I scroll 
len ratingone And yeah websites gotta scroll 
len ratingone Sometimes this manifests when I scroll vertically the browser window actually slides to the left or right into this random white space 
len ratingone No other browsers have this issue so I ve wondered if chrome is expecting css arrangements that of websites seemingly do not support 
len ratingone I m at my wits end and have started to opt for safari whenever possible 
len ratingtwo Can t logout once on Chrome and now I m connected to multiple gmail accounts 
len ratingtwo I deleted the App on my iPhone and then changed my password 
len ratingtwo Seriously 
len ratingtwo A logout should be available 
len ratingthree It doesn t let me switch accounts but everything else about it is fine
len ratingone  Your chrome books are mid Microsoft solos your verse This you downloading years later midxmid solos HP solos too Safari beats you without trying Look it s a Mac 
len ratingone  Any computer company solos Yahoo solos NO BING AND I MEAN THE TRASH BING SOLOS mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid
len ratingone New update is buggy when I close out of Chrome I lose all my tabs 
len ratingone This can t possibly be a feature can it 
len ratingtwo Animated GIFs that are saved from Google Chrome to the iPhone do not work after saving them 
len ratingtwo Tried this with other browsers and they all worked without issue 
len ratingtwo For those of you that this impacts like myself be warned 
len ratingone I clicked restore my tabs when Chrome Didn t close properly and it didn t go through now all of my tabs are gone are you kidding me 
len ratingtwo  LATEST There is yet another glitch where now when the user holds the Chrome icon and clicks New Search instead of bringing up the search it brings up the user s Reading List 
len ratingtwo Just another glitch to add the already extensive pile of unresolved issues 
len ratingtwo DELETING MY REVIEWS IS NOT GOING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES AND GLITCHES GOODLE DEVS HAVE LEFT IN THE CHROME BROWSER 
len ratingtwo I WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP COPIES OF MY REVIEWS AND WILL COMMIT TO REPOSTING THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE DELETED 
len ratingtwo I HAVE BOUGHT INTO GOOGLE WITH A CHROMEBOOK AND CLOUD STORAGE SO IM INVESTING IN GOOGLE FINALLY RESOLVING THESE LONG STANDING GLITCHES AND ISSUES 
len ratingtwo ALL GLITCHES AND ISSUES MENTIONED BELOW ARE STILL UNRESOLVED CHROME BROWSER ON IOS IS STILL WILDLY UNSTABLE 
len ratingtwo UPDATE It s been weeks now since my previous review 
len ratingtwo Chrome is still broken to the point of being unusable 
len ratingtwo I switched to Safari for a while but now I ve moved on to Brave 
len ratingtwo As someone who owns a Chromebook I m really disappointed in the state of their browser 
len ratingtwo I ll keep checking from time to time to see if these issues get resolved but until they do I have to use different browsers for different devices because Chrome on IOS is broken 
len ratingtwo Biggest tech company can t even keep their flagship browser in a usable state 
len ratingtwo PREVIOUS REVIEW Chrome has a major glitch 
len ratingtwo Anytime I attempt to zoom into a website Chrome completely errors out with Aw snap and the entire website is gone and must be reloaded 
len ratingtwo This has been happening for weeks now and happens every time I try to zoom in 
len ratingtwo New issue has started 
len ratingtwo The browser can t sit still and keeps moving elements around 
len ratingtwo For instance text I m reading will jump up or down the page making it impossible to read 
len ratingtwo The only way to get around this is to keep one finger on the screen and keep slightly moving up and down 
len ratingtwo But not fingers because that can count as a zoom and as I mentioned above will break the browser completely with the Am Snap issue 
len ratingtwo Between these glitches Chrome has become unusable at this time 
len ratingtwo Chrome is broken as of writing this review 
len ratingtwo I ve gone back to Safari and will continually check up on Chrome until the devs finally work through these bugs 
len ratingtwo  Also I have copied my review as Apple s App Store has started a habit of removing my reviews 
len ratingtwo If they continue with this behavior I will simply re add my review each time 
len ratingone It lets me sync my bookmarks with my laptop on which I also use Chrome 
len ratingone That s a nice feature 
len ratingone But it s so mind blowingly awful with privacy that I ve deleted it from all mobile devices 
len ratingone iOS Chrome is completely lacking in every basic privacy control one would expect of any browser built after 
len ratingone This thing doesn t just track and save everything you do it presents a list of all recently visited sites any time you open a new tab and there s no way to opt out of this or turn it off 
len ratingone You can t even delete in bulk you have to remove these recently visited sites one by one unless you re willing to clear your entire browser history 
len ratingone The new tab also automatically loads a selection of news stories and there s no way to turn off that feature 
len ratingone It s like logging onto AOL circa 
len ratingone Sure you could use incognito mode but it shouldn t be an all or nothing choice 
len ratingone If I want to have my cookies and history saved without my search history being immediately presented to anyone who picks up my iPad that should be an option 
len ratingone  And why when visiting Google sites does it assume I want to use the most recently added Google account used in my Gmail app 
len ratingone Wouldn t it make more sense to assume I m using the default primary one if it s going to autofill the login screen 
len ratingone And why make it so difficult to log out so that I can log in to the proper account 
len ratingone I can t believe there hasn t been an update in over months 
len ratingone Seriously considering switching to another browser 
len ratingfive Gogo com
len ratingtwo The app is very good overall issue is bringing down my review 
len ratingtwo Recently i am unable to save gifs to my phone from the chrome browser 
len ratingtwo The feature still works on safari so it seems like chrome is the issue 
len ratingtwo Once fixed the review would go up 
len ratingone I originally downloaded this app accidentally and now I can t get rid of it 
len ratingone Costumer beware 
len ratingone Get Firefox instead 
len ratingone Don t lie to us update your app and tell us about how our data is used 
len ratingone We deserve to know 
len ratingtwo Every time I use the app it for whatever reason zooms out and it s just sitting on the left had side of my screen no matter what I do it can t fix it until I close the app and reload it deleted until it s fixed 
len ratingone  Something nefarious is going on here and someone needs to find out why why are previously closed windows reopening themselves in new session 
len ratingone This is major security issue even after closing them AND quitting Chrome includes normal browsing tabs BUT ESPECIALLY CLOSED INCOGNITO WINDOWS 
len ratingone HOLY HECK 
len ratingone Hey Google we all know you guys are shaking in your boots since Dec th s App Store Privacy Transparency requirements stop stalling updates on all your iOS apps and get it together 
len ratingone You can t hide forever on what your apps have REALLY been doing behind the scenes 
len ratingone FIX THIS STUFF
len ratingtwo Open go to another app come back 
len ratingtwo It wants to open the first tab that was open instead of the last tab 
len ratingtwo Sometimes when crossing tabs it keeps opening next active tab instead of being in overview 
len ratingtwo Also needs a way to quickly swipe away tabs like in Android 
len ratingone So I usually use 
len ratingone Grime but lately I feel like it is constantly shutting down and kicking me out 
len ratingone Especially the past two days 
len ratingone Chrome has always been my go to but man oh man this is getting ridiculous 
len ratingone Maybe it s a bug or maybe it s the update but i cannot do my normal browsing because it continues to kick me out 
len ratingfive  Why do people complain about google 
len ratingone Literally the sides don t line up after the slights refresh or horizontal axis flip 
len ratingone For one of the most use apps on the most used platform it sure is disappointing to see zero updates helping this 
len ratingtwo  The page keeps zooming out when I rotate the phone and go back to portrait and the tab can no longer be used without having a giant white bar on the side 
len ratingtwo  I have traditionally used Chrome as my go to web browser across all my Apple devices 
len ratingtwo Recently Chrome has not displayed web pages properly on iOS 
len ratingtwo When moving from portrait to landscape and vice versa the page becomes skewed and difficult to operate 
len ratingtwo The only fix is to close the affected tab and reopen the page 
len ratingtwo I d like to change my rating once this issue is resolved 
len ratingfive THE PORNHUB COM RUNS SMOOTHLY
len ratingone This is a bug that s existed for months and still no fix 
len ratingone Seriously this fix should ve been implemented months ago 
len ratingone Google can be useful but I m sick and tired of them pushing democratic supporting news story s in my newsfeed there is no escaping something I really couldn t care less about so freeing myself today of trash app 
len ratingtwo It took too long to even be able to tell me that it is even downloading and also it is very slow 
len ratingfive  This is epic for my research if u know what I mean
len ratingfive Google Chrome is an awesome app 
len ratingfive I use it on my school iPad it works very smoothly when I am researching things it makes it easier to open more tabs 
len ratingfive And if I have to listen to a video for school and write notes I can listen and write 
len ratingtwo Idk if the it s a new update or something new but the screen shrinks after changing orientation of the phone 
len ratingone I hate everything about it
len ratingthree The bug that was fixed in chrome has returned with chrome 
len ratingthree Rotating to landscape and then back to portrait completely breaks the margins of the webpage being displayed 
len ratingthree Sent countless feedback reports and I see countless reviews about it on here 
len ratingthree It s insane to me that it hasn t been fixed yet 
len ratingthree If I didn t rely so much on sync between my phone in my computer I would ve gone back to Safari by now and that s saying something 
len ratingone Pathetic
len ratingthree When I m using Google Chrome for iOS on my iPhone Pro Max if I tilt the screen from portrait to landscape and back to portrait the app shows margins on both sides that shrink any webpage I m using 
len ratingthree Then scrolling down causes the margin on the left to shift to the right making the webpage offset to the left 
len ratingthree Refreshing the page by swiping up does not fix the issue but refreshing by clicking the URL then return will fix the issue temporarily 
len ratingtwo As of late chrome on the iPhone hasn t been great to work on 
len ratingtwo When zooming in or out or scrolling from left to right on a page the viewing gets messed up and won t return to normal margins 
len ratingtwo It will stay zoomed in or won t return to the full screen and will only show on a portion of the screen 
len ratingtwo Please fix soon 
len ratingthree I use this app a lot but I am inspired by the computers pc web with bookmarks changed so please make it look exactly like the PCs please give a response
len ratingone Google should not be having this many app issues on the iPhone 
len ratingone Got the iPhone and it s been a disaster ever since 
len ratingone The app constantly crashes the pages don t load and it forever stays at the finished loading screen 
len ratingone Sometimes if I type in a search word it keeps deleting it and making it the search term I had before over and over again and I can t even find a way to report all these issues 
len ratingone  Google is censoring companies and has a monopoly in video and searches
len ratingfour When you click on images now to view the ones similar to it you have to press a button to see them 
len ratingfour Why did they do this 
len ratingfour I don t find it useful 
len ratingthree So many bugs 
len ratingthree So so many bugs Random crashes pages refusing to load forcing you to close the tab voice not working other features such as find in page or request desktop page are spotty 
len ratingthree Expected more being that this is google but over the years quality seems to be lackluster 
len ratingone chrome app is crashing in iphone mini it crashes and restarts and this is happening frequently 
len ratingone app mainly used before crash facebook 
len ratingtwo Chrome is far slower compared to Safari on my iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo I only use chrome for my school account 
len ratingtwo My only issue with chrome besides the speed is the fact that when I m using an external keyboard the password auto fill bar is on top of the suggested text field 
len ratingtwo Hopefully google will find a way to implement it so I don t have double the bar on my screen 
len ratingone I m certain point in time you have to cut the cord because you realize that your personal information should stay personal 
len ratingone Any search engine or media platform or major news should not be able to censor what is being said whether you like what s being said or not 
len ratingone You are slowly allowing them to take away your first amendment right 
len ratingfour I like this app so much I use this app everyday 
len ratingfour This translator is great 
len ratingfive I get every background on my phone 
len ratingfive I use Chrome at school and it helps everything 
len ratingone THIS DOES NOT WORK ON A APPLE IPAD I GOT A NEW ONE FOR CHRISTMAS AND NO MATTER WHAT I DO IT DOES NOT WORK I JUST GO ROUND AND ROUND 
len ratingone DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THIS IF YOU HAVE A APPLE IPAD 
len ratingone BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK ON A APPLE IPAD 
len ratingone I GIVE IT NO STARS 
len ratingfour Missing one star due to one simple thing every time I go in landscape and then into portrait it s like cut down on each side 
len ratingfour Forcing me to restart app
len ratingone I cannot in good conscience support this company and use their product after their blatant denying of the first amendment 
len ratingone They are trying to shut down speech to anyone that disagrees with their extreme left point of view
len ratingone I had so many valuable tabs opened on my phone 
len ratingone They re all gone now and no way to retrieve them 
len ratingone I believe it happened after syncing 
len ratingone Get y all act together 
len ratingone This shouldn t happen 
len ratingthree I love Chrome but it is becoming annoying 
len ratingthree Every time I go to open the app or open a new tab it automatically opens an older tab 
len ratingthree It s a small issue but it s super annoying 
len ratingone I used to use this app for years but after months of not fixing the issue where turning the phone sideways shrinks margins on a webpage I switched to Firefox 
len ratingone Some of us use iPad for work with Chrome 
len ratingone How about a tab manager or saver feature which we can restore all tabs we close accidentally 
len ratingone There are extensions for Chrome for PC s that do that but not iPad and it s about time you guys fix this 
len ratingone We cannot be expected to go through history to reopen each and every single tab 
len ratingone It doesn t work when you have tabs open at once in your browser 
len ratingone Firefox does this and I am really tempted to just ditch Chrome all together from all my devices 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone I don t know why but it won t let me delete my search history and when I go to sleep it in again it shows like if I m watching YouTube on there and I clear my history and I go to search it up again then it s there and whenever you like searching up an app but you don t want to pop up again it pops up and also the setting things I don t know whether an eggnog thing is 
len ratingtwo Riddled with glitches on iPhone XS 
len ratingtwo Trouble playing videos in landscape mode 
len ratingtwo Constant issues with webpage filling screen 
len ratingtwo I need to switch back to safari 
len ratingtwo I ll update review when fixed
len ratingone  Every time I switch from horizontal to vertical view the page shrinks 
len ratingone I have to exit the app and reload it for it to go back to normal 
len ratingone It s very frustrating 
len ratingone If this persists I m going to use a different browser 
len ratingone Chrome data mines and tracks user input at all times 
len ratingone I do not want my every move tracked 
len ratingone Also do not like the interface 
len ratingtwo Google is seemingly avoiding providing the info in re their data collecting that Apple now requires for iOS apps 
len ratingtwo Their last app updates of any Google apps as best I can tell was circa December th 
len ratingtwo Even Facebook has fully fessed up on what they collect 
len ratingtwo The fact that Google hasn t is very suspect to me 
len ratingone Why have u not fixed the shrinking margins issue 
len ratingone It s been happening for months and no resolution 
len ratingthree Hi my kid could not use this for school now because it is years old
len ratingfive It s the best app to watch pornhub I love this
len ratingone Everyone knows google owned apps like Chrome are monitoring your private data 
len ratingone Why would you choose to use any app from google now 
len ratingthree Idk what they did on the recent update but my chrome browser and google app crashed and when it reloaded the google app no longer had my history but started keeping tabs kinda pointless cus that s what the chrome browser does and the chrome app no longer displays results in dark mode 
len ratingthree What is the point of dark mode if it s only to see what tabs you have open 
len ratingthree The results and then the actual page are not in dark mode 
len ratingthree But with the google app everything is in dark mode 
len ratingthree Someone dropped the ball on this one 
len ratingtwo App keeps crashing
len ratingone As others have said the app is now shrinking pages so now only of the screen is used 
len ratingfive I dont agree with most of the people with bad comments it is a safe browser that is easy to useM I can chat with my friend on it with an application such as google meet 
len ratingfive Change your decisions NOW 
len ratingtwo  The most decent app for browsing but it s about to replaced well by anything since it s lost it s edge 
len ratingtwo Literally the sides don t line up after the slights refresh or horizontal axis flip 
len ratingtwo For one of the most use apps on the most used platform it sure is disappointing to see zero updates helping this 
len ratingthree its kinda 
len ratingone Chrome is great if you want to have your information sent to the government 
len ratingone If you like having your search results limited censored go right ahead and limit quality information 
len ratingtwo  If you rotate into then out of landscape view the page width gets adjusted broken it becomes more narrow and will not revert have to open a new tab 
len ratingfour We want to be able to save a website to home screens on iOS devices as one can do with Safari 
len ratingfour Please and thanks 
len ratingone This last update has caused so many glitches that the app is now extra frustrating to use 
len ratingone The most annoying one is now when you switch from vertical to horizontal or vice versa it shrinks the page and won t go back unless I restart the app 
len ratingone Also I loathe that when I m typing in the search bar more complicated searches pop up instead of just the obvious and more popular answer 
len ratingone They need an update for better ios use ASAP 
len ratingfour I mean this is the best browser in my opinion
len ratingone  Fix your app 
len ratingone Why does the screen keep shrinking over to the left side 
len ratingone This is annoying 
len ratingfive I hit the new window by accident but now I can not get back to one screen could someone tell me how to get back to just the one screen
len ratingfive  Thanks to y all imma about to finds some people s IP Adress and shoot up their house 
len ratingfive  I wanna smell the seeem aneft
len ratingone Chrome was a real trooper for years it never gave me any problems 
len ratingone But in the last six months it has lost all of my tabs on at least three occasions 
len ratingone I might have dozens of tabs open while I m researching then suddenly boom it s one tab 
len ratingone No way to get the old tabs back 
len ratingone Thank god I m not syncing it to my desktop browser 
len ratingone  Saving a new bookmark in the ios app is just impossible 
len ratingone I have absolutely no idea how you figured out how to screw up something so basic 
len ratingone Bookmark folders just vomited all over the place 
len ratingone Why not just load them in their actual order 
len ratingone Seems obvious 
len ratingone Use Qwant or DuckDuckGo
len ratingtwo The app has gotten glitchy again
len ratingone Regularly doesn t shut down properly thus all tabs 
len ratingone Only gives a few seconds to hit restore Multiple times in the past few months I ve lost dozens of tabs with significant information 
len ratingone I had a BUNCH of tabs open that I thought These are kind of important I ll just go for a drink and finish up with them Boom not for the first time the app completely crashed 
len ratingone What s worse and why I rate it so low is that the restore tabs button froze and refused to work 
len ratingone Check recent tabs 
len ratingone Nothing 
len ratingtwo This browser shrinks the mobile pages and won t fix itself 
len ratingtwo It is super annoying 
len ratingone  Communist
len ratingtwo I use Chrome as my default mobile browser and it has been great until a couple months ago 
len ratingtwo Now every time I switch from vertical to horizontal and back the page is completely unusable 
len ratingtwo Refreshing the page doesn t help only opening a new tab 
len ratingtwo Will have to find a new browser
len ratingone  Fix your app 
len ratingone Oh wait you re concerned about the privacy policy 
len ratingone Very recent issue presumably appeared with the last update 
len ratingone Almost of the time when I finish browsing close all the tabs entirely and then shut down chrome next time I reopen chrome it revives at least one of those previously closed tabs 
len ratingone Tested it enough times that I can say for certain that the tabs were fully closed prior to shutting down the app 
len ratingtwo Honestly Chrome feels dated antiquated and poorly optimized on iOS 
len ratingtwo This is Chrome on iPhone XS Max running iOS 
len ratingtwo It s been months now and for some reason the bug with the screen orientation is STILL an issue 
len ratingtwo In case you re not aware opening the app rotating it to landscape to watch a video for instance then rotating it back to portrait causes the web pages to appear narrower 
len ratingtwo Currently there s no way to fix it unless I force quit and restart Chrome 
len ratingtwo Chrome has had their glory days and now it s just becoming a meh experience for both iOS and Windows 
len ratingtwo It s like they just stopped caring 
len ratingtwo I ve since switched back to Safari on iOS and Microsoft Edge on Win 
len ratingone Censors what you see 
len ratingone Use DuckDuckGo Instead 
len ratingtwo Like most browsers it requires times the necessary processing power it should because it floods you with ads 
len ratingtwo Wondering why browsing is so slow why pages half load or crash 
len ratingtwo Ads chewing up your processor and ram 
len ratingtwo Then there s the white bar of nothing that takes up a rd of the browser after you ve used it for a few minutes 
len ratingtwo The good is that it syncs with the desktop version 
len ratingtwo The bad is it s performance and the willingness of its creators to allow too much tracking and too many ads all of which negatively affects the performance 
len ratingfive I have medbay and copied you and I am so happy that I have a lot to say I am sorry for you I didn t mean that you didn t answer my phone so you can call you when you are here I can hear your
len ratingone never should have updated 
len ratingone regret it much 
len ratingone switched to firefox 
len ratingone chrome has removed the easy to use bookmark star 
len ratingone now there is no easy easy way to manage sort search bookmarks 
len ratingone not a useful browser 
len ratingone chrome flags settings no longer fix this 
len ratingone Even though I ve got an iPhone Chrome was my go to browser Until a recent update where it started acting like it was on crack 
len ratingone  And not in a good way 
len ratingone You hit the button to select a window and it pops you over to some random window from before 
len ratingone And its password tracking stopped working correctly 
len ratingone It is absolutely maddening so much that I ve gone back to Safari now 
len ratingone  UPDATE This review was written months ago and still no fix 
len ratingthree Did not have any issues with crashes 
len ratingthree But its frustrating to wait for app to load last visited webpage whenever app is opened then close it and start new browsing session 
len ratingthree I actually wish that app didn t restore last session 
len ratingthree I like that feature only for pc versions 
len ratingone You know why 
len ratingone Shrinks screen puts it on half of the screen update was not good 
len ratingthree Whenever I switch from horizontal to vertical or vice versa the screen becomes messed up turns half size 
len ratingthree Please have this fixed soon it gets annoying 
len ratingfour I use google daily its the browser 
len ratingfour The only thing I don t like is the inappropriate content that can be shown on google 
len ratingfour Other than that its awesome 
len ratingthree I don t like to click to change the tab 
len ratingthree It s not as smooth as that in safari 
len ratingfour It s a good app but it needs a true dark mode instead of just borders being dark actual pages need to be dark because they re so bright you can t see the lettering otherwise
len ratingone No longer works with screen time in iOS 
len ratingthree When l search a page 
len ratingthree out of nowhere it zooms in and it does not go away 
len ratingthree I don t like that 
len ratingthree Please try to fix it 
len ratingtwo Glitch with latest update every time I turn my phone sideways on a site and then back upright the website shrinks from full width to about of its original size 
len ratingtwo Losing of the screen is a legit problem on a phone 
len ratingtwo Reloading the page by manually hitting enter on the url is only way to fix 
len ratingtwo Refreshing page doesn t do it 
len ratingtwo Really annoying 
len ratingtwo Chrome used to be amazing but there s so many features lacking on the iOS version vs Android like a home button for example 
len ratingtwo But what brought me here is the fact the app is glitching 
len ratingtwo If I click on the button to look at all my tabs opened the app jumps to a random tab that I was not trying to see 
len ratingtwo When I click X on a tab instead of it staying in the tab preview it ll jump to the next tab open 
len ratingtwo This was not the case before and this needs to be fixed 
len ratingtwo It s super annoying when I m trying to go to a specific tab and then chrome just jumps to a random tab that I didn t want 
len ratingtwo This started happening a few months ago and I m not sure why it s doing that 
len ratingthree Everything time I go in landscape mode and turn back to portrait mode it shrinks my page 
len ratingthree I love being able to sync tabs and passwords between desktop and mobile but on iPhone mini the browser s tab content pane sometimes shrinks to only occupy of the screen width 
len ratingthree  annoying
len ratingone Use duck amp go or anything private but not chrome
len ratingone App got deleted cannot reinstall 
len ratingone Fix please 
len ratingone Just don t download this addition to the trash can of apps from companies that use your data to profit themselves 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingone Had no problems with chrome until i updated it everytime I switch to horizontal it glitches out and the screen shrinks to half the size
len ratingone A total hot message of a browser
len ratingfour I really like this browser 
len ratingfour One of my favorites cuz it lets you do stuff more comfortably than other apps 
len ratingfour I think it s secure and the buttons are super easy to use and understand 
len ratingfour It never does anything weird for me 
len ratingfour One thing I think can improve is the back button undo button because when I press it sometimes it takes me to a page I never even visited 
len ratingone  Alex Jones did nothing wrong 
len ratingfive Idk it s ok I guess
len ratingfive Hi I hope this message finds you well 
len ratingfive Unfortunately due to some problems I had to reset my iPad which is the second model and now I lost my applications 
len ratingfive I really need to download google chrome for my online classes but the latest update for this model is iOS 
len ratingfive And the one in App Store is not compatible 
len ratingfive What can I do to get the old version 
len ratingone  Censorship manipulation and corruption at it s finest 
len ratingone Google is up there with Facebook Twitter and Apple 
len ratingone  Nazi app and un American app 
len ratingone Don t use it if you respect freedom and equality 
len ratingone The overreach of tech oligarchs knows no bounds 
len ratingone Switch to DuckDuckGo if you value your privacy 
len ratingone  Censorship
len ratingone Censoring content
len ratingone Crashing
len ratingthree Newest generation iPhone model has lag issues when using the Chrome app only 
len ratingthree If you reduce cpu cycles used to steal personal data and put it towards running this app then these issues would disappear 
len ratingthree Sincerely
len ratingthree Long time use of Chrome on Windows and Android and I knew I couldn t give up the ease of syncing across all my devices when I recently switched to iPhone 
len ratingthree Unfortunately the UI for Chrome s iOS app feels significantly worse than its Android counterpart 
len ratingthree Please give us the option to have the search URL bar at the bottom 
len ratingthree Also the orientation bug causing page breaking margins is very annoying 
len ratingone  If you want an app endorsed by Hitler Stalin Mao and every other commie in the world this is it 
len ratingone Terrible Browser that by default tracks your information without telling you 
len ratingthree Coke on Google we have been waiting since summer for a screen shifting bug fix 
len ratingthree It s been very difficult trying to find a usable browser to replace chrome while waiting for the update it so badly needs 
len ratingthree I ll keep looking out for an update in the app store but until I see it in going to keep trying other lesser browsers 
len ratingthree Can t wait to come back to chrome even if they have limitless resources but somehow can t fix a little bug for months on end 
len ratingtwo Please give us the option to remove the QR button and voice search buttons 
len ratingtwo If I accidentally hit the qr button while typing it removes the entire entry I had just written and I have to start over
len ratingone They think they have the power over our lives to sell our data to advertisers to get us to buy what they want censor what we see and hear and push their liberal agenda on everybody time to drop them and use Brave DuckDuckGo and others that care about protecting your data and free speech 
len ratingone Thank you google for demolishing free speech 
len ratingone Apparently we are incapable of thinking for ourselves 
len ratingone I want to say swear words but I m not a swearing kind of person 
len ratingone I m so stinking mad at what has transpired in the last few days 
len ratingone Shame on you 
len ratingone Anything Google you want to stay away from they have a bad habit of selling and collecting your data that you re doing through their browsers and search engines not a very good platform if unless you like your information copied stored and used by others
len ratingone Google used to be my favorite search engine no matter what but I have noticed that they filter the search results heavily 
len ratingone  There are much better and safer options 
len ratingone I would recommend brave if you want privacy 
len ratingfive  So good
len ratingfive  serch
len ratingone Google is blocking me from seeing any sites that sell firearms and ammo 
len ratingone Is anybody else having this issue 
len ratingone This isn t secure 
len ratingone It sells your info 
len ratingone Try duckduckgo instead
len ratingone  Google can you learn to write code 
len ratingone That d be greeeaat thanks 
len ratingone If you love RESTORE button pressing every seconds then Chrome is for you 
len ratingone  Avoid using Google products at all costs who are silencing and now destroying conservatives at their own cost 
len ratingtwo I love using google chrome as I ve used it as my sole browser on my Windows OS laptop and my Samsung s 
len ratingtwo It is terrible on iPhone 
len ratingtwo I would say a majority of the time a web page loads it loads very funky and the page won t be centered 
len ratingtwo Images and text will be cut off 
len ratingtwo Very annoying 
len ratingone Total censorship according to their agenda
len ratingfive I like it
len ratingtwo It s been crashing for months on the iPad I had to switch over to Mozilla customer support was a joke 
len ratingone Steps Start in portrait iphone open any webpage 
len ratingone Rotate to landscape 
len ratingone Rotate back to portrait Viewport is much narrower that initially creating left and right margins that shrink the content from the left edge to the right edge
len ratingtwo The app randomly crashes after new update like for real 
len ratingone Promotes anti free speech articles and urls
len ratingone After recent updates every time when I rotate the phone to horizontal and rotate it back the webpage will have big blank space in one side of both sides
len ratingone Anyone using Chrome for personal use is a fool 
len ratingone They may allow you to voice your opinion today but what happens when you have something to say that they disagree with 
len ratingfour I like the Chrome browser itself but I ve noticed I can t save GIFs in the iOS version of Chrome 
len ratingfour They all save as still photos 
len ratingfour The same files save properly using Safari 
len ratingtwo  Google Chrome now has news posts appearing in its search page 
len ratingtwo I hate that 
len ratingtwo Do they think I really care about J Ho and her strapped swimsuit 
len ratingone There is a bug that occurs when you switch the orientation of your phone between landscape and portrait 
len ratingone When you switch back to portrait Chrome thinks it has a lot less space than it does and renders the page at width against the left side of the screen 
len ratingone It makes the app unusable and it has been this way for months 
len ratingone You hire the best engineers in the world 
len ratingone Not sure how this could go on for as long as it has 
len ratingone Google has submitted to their CCP overlords and censored search results 
len ratingone You will never find the truth here 
len ratingone I thought I seen it all 
len ratingone Just another BIG CORPORATION helping to hide one side but can t for the other side 
len ratingone Regardless I still need to use for work but it will all eventually it roll up hill and hit where it hurts 
len ratingone I will avoid using you in the future 
len ratingone Censoring people for their political views when you don t censor terrorists and others is wrong 
len ratingone Censoring conservative voices so you can continue to lie to the Americans is evil 
len ratingone Every time I try to scroll down on a shopping page it just shoots me back up to the top of the page 
len ratingone This has happened on other devices and I m the google app itself 
len ratingone They seriously need to fix this
len ratingone Uninstalled chrome and moved over to Opera 
len ratingone Opera is a way better browser that doesn t censor and force its values on its users 
len ratingtwo This is on a barely used iPad with few apps 
len ratingtwo Wasn t a problem until the past few months 
len ratingtwo Fix it Google 
len ratingone I will not support censorship 
len ratingtwo Every time that I love the new page for some reason the page and just as itself to a smaller version like a skinny page instead of the regular version to fit screen 
len ratingtwo It s getting really irritating 
len ratingone The last few months I ve been getting big square congratulations you ve won adds plus others that take up most of the Google screen after I ve been on it a few minutes 
len ratingone They don t go away 
len ratingone I have no idea how to get rid of them 
len ratingone  I lost all my taps suddenly because of how poor this app was made 
len ratingone Shorting google to since they got sued by the government for anti trust laws and are now instilling war upon the people by censoring anyone that goes against their child trafficking agenda 
len ratingone Boycott big tech
len ratingone When rotating from Landscape to Portrait view the page gets limited to the left of the screen 
len ratingone Must close the app then reopen 
len ratingone Not using until issue is fixed 
len ratingthree  Just like safari google chrome needs to let us download files and save to Dropbox 
len ratingthree This app would get a star if the downloads button worked 
len ratingthree Does this app always change the screen formatting when going from portrait to landscape and then back to portrait 
len ratingthree Every time i return to portrait the web pages don t fill the whole page 
len ratingthree Doesn t matter what site they all do it 
len ratingthree Looks great turn landscape and looks great turn back to portrait and looks terrible 
len ratingthree Only way to fix is completely close and restart browser 
len ratingthree Please fix
len ratingone Again 
len ratingone Might be a great interface but if it can t remember last week no good for me 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingone Moving on to something anything else 
len ratingthree I would give this a star but whenever I tap chrome it just randomly opens a tab Mind you that this is happening in chrome mobile Any ideas on how to fix it 
len ratingtwo Fix the orientation bug
len ratingfive  I like chrome because I can get to every thing I need without going send a message to mom i can go send a message and i have so much time to go out side and play in the snow 
len ratingfive And the app lets you do ALMOST ANYTHING 
len ratingfive I m so glad i bought Chrome Leo Wargo Nintendo switch and Roblox account Leodemon
len ratingone Hello 
len ratingone Hello 
len ratingone Does anyone at Google care 
len ratingone Page margins on almost all content are broken when the page re flows after changing orientation 
len ratingone Plenty of reports here 
len ratingone Crashes and I lose all tabs 
len ratingone Even if only are open 
len ratingone Not sure what s going on but this browser is unusable 
len ratingthree Coming across the same display issues as everyone else whenever I zoom in out of a page or after rotating it from landscape back to portrait 
len ratingthree The only temporary remedy I have found is to either close and reopen the app or to click on URL search bar as if I m going to search something else and then just back out 
len ratingthree Fixes it every time however not my ideal way of utilizing this app 
len ratingthree Chrome itself is wonderful but since installing the app recently a lot of mobile website load improperly and only take up half my screen and it even happens on google searches 
len ratingthree Three stars until this is fixed because the websites will continue to improperly load until I restart the app which is an insane hassle 
len ratingthree Thinking of switching back to safari
len ratingtwo Love chrome used it exclusively for years 
len ratingtwo Recently got an Iphone and since then the browser randomly resizes to only fill of the screen vertically 
len ratingtwo Very confusing and happens across web 
len ratingtwo Prefer chrome but back to safari hopefully fixed soon 
len ratingone When switching tabs it random open the first tab and pisses me off 
len ratingone Sometimes it zooms in and you can t zoom out 
len ratingone Also it offsets the website 
len ratingone Why put a period in a natural spot for me to press the space bar 
len ratingone If you want a period put it at the top with everything else 
len ratingone This is the worst BEST browser 
len ratingone Absolutely awful 
len ratingone Stupid in every way 
len ratingone I hate that I need to recommend this browser for things 
len ratingone Please give me an option to have my normal keyboard 
len ratingone I waste so much time having to edit my search because of the stupid period button
len ratingone Does not stay open 
len ratingone Crashes all the time 
len ratingone Unhappy with the new update 
len ratingthree  Everytime I rotate my phone in landscape and back onto portrait again it ends up shrinking the webpage altogether 
len ratingthree I can t do anything without constantly closing and reopening the tab 
len ratingthree Please fix this as other browsers do not have this issue
len ratingone  I thought it was my internet until I switched browsers on every device 
len ratingone Chrome is not loading when I enter a search or when I enter a line in the URL box 
len ratingone It s seriously frustrating 
len ratingone It s happening on both my computers and my cell phone 
len ratingfive When I downloaded I thought it was gonna be useless and I needed to use it and I got addicted for gloogling stuff
len ratingtwo Google chrome for iPadOS does not support YouTube movies 
len ratingtwo YouTube is part of Google s Alphabet
len ratingthree I love Chrome 
len ratingthree It s the only browser I use but as of late it s been reopening webpages that I had previously closed after exiting the app 
len ratingthree Also a lot of webpages keep reloading are unable to load or cause the app to crash 
len ratingthree This wasn t an issue a few weeks ago 
len ratingone I ve used Chrome for iOS since it was released but or months ago it started having display issues 
len ratingone Whatever page I am looking at will suddenly display across only of the window 
len ratingone Doesn t matter what website zooming in doesn t work as the page jumps back to being too small and reading anything is useless 
len ratingone I ve found numerous reports on this from other users have reinstalled restarted my phone everything to no effect 
len ratingone Unfortunately I m uninstalling and i can t recommend this browser 
len ratingone Hopefully they will fix this issue cause it s ruined my favorite browser 
len ratingone Whenever in a web page every couple of pages or swipes in the screen the page goes from full screen to moving to the left I have to keep refreshing for the page to go back to full screen 
len ratingone So annoying 
len ratingtwo several people have mentioned the issue that i m having 
len ratingtwo I open a new tab and am immediately switched to another tab sometimes the most recent and always on the left hand side 
len ratingtwo this fills me with such unholy rage that I have just completely switched back to safari for the time being 
len ratingtwo Ive been using chrome for ages but this glitch is just incredibly annoying 
len ratingone This app says it s for and if your child got so easily exposed to porn that s your problem for not keeping your eye on them 
len ratingone But it s still a bad app it glitches and supposedly takes your info yes google takes your information 
len ratingone But I don t think it s used for anything bad the only scary thing about google or chrome in my opinion is the viruses that can be easily avoided if you re careful 
len ratingone But like I said still a bad app so 
len ratingfive Has good quality
len ratingfour I enjoy the app as I use Google as my main search hub 
len ratingfour However I m experiencing an issue when scrolling suggested news articles 
len ratingfour If I scroll down for a second page of titles to load and select one when I exit the site it brings me back to the first page of titles and not the second page where I selected the article from 
len ratingfour It does so even for articles at the absolute end of my suggested list
len ratingfive  So good
len ratingone Used to be my favorite 
len ratingone Now Chrome is trash 
len ratingone The browser shrinks the margins every time I try to load a page so that the font is minuscule and the actual presentation only takes up a thin band of my phone s available screen 
len ratingone There are so many glitches just with presentation alone that I struggle to describe them all 
len ratingone Every time I go in chrome my web pages keep zooming in and won t zoom out 
len ratingone It s very frustrating when I m trying to read something 
len ratingone I m just gonna start using Safari if this doesn t get fixed ASAP
len ratingone Does not stay open 
len ratingone Crashes 
len ratingone Seems to happen on Fox 
len ratingthree Since the recent update when I close out of a page it will reappear the next time I open the app 
len ratingthree Also every time I load a page from my bookmarks it will add an icon for the bookmark to my Home Screen 
len ratingthree I don t want the site on my main page just because I visited it 
len ratingthree I don t know what happened but an annoying bug that makes of the view useless is very aggravating 
len ratingthree I will open up a webpage to see a white stripe consuming the right side of the view 
len ratingthree There is no way to get it back but close the tab and reload again which is sometimes incredibly inconvenient if you re doing anything more than reading 
len ratingthree Please fix this stupid rendering bug that seems to shift the view to the left and compress it in the remaining space 
len ratingthree Very annoying 
len ratingone Why
len ratingone I sign up for discount coupon then less than an hour later I buy almost mattress and they won t accept the fifty dollar coupon 
len ratingone Apparently the coupon they advertise is expired how unprofessional
len ratingtwo The whole shrinking the page to the size is annoying 
len ratingtwo The only way I can find to fix it is to close the tab and open a new one which is even more annoying 
len ratingone Does not properly resize when switching from landscape 
len ratingone Using iPhone mini
len ratingone Google chrome has been fantastic for many years on iOS and has only just recently given me problems in the past months 
len ratingone Every time you go to view your open tabs it automatically selects and reloads the first tab you have open 
len ratingone Absolutely infuriating 
len ratingone Also if you are viewing a web page and rotate your phone horizontally then back to vertical you loose half of your page margins 
len ratingone Google please for the love of god fix this 
len ratingfive I m downloading this on my iOS iPad cause safari has NO incognito mode
len ratingthree  I do NOT own an IPad and I have NEVER logged in from one 
len ratingthree I prefer Chrome over Safari but every time I open the app it reopens whatever tab and closed the last time I had the app open
len ratingthree I hate when im looking on a page or shopping on a tab and then I come back and everything resets 
len ratingthree I lose my place and its really annoying 
len ratingone I open the app I search for something I go to the first link in the results and when I hit the back button the results are now zoomed out with a gap on the right side of the screen 
len ratingone The only solution is to kill the app and restart 
len ratingone None of this is related to flipping from portrait to landscape 
len ratingone All I m using is the back button 
len ratingone Everyone else is complaining about the same thing 
len ratingone Fix your crap Google 
len ratingone USE DUCKDUCKGO
len ratingthree Everything seems fine except for the features added based on simple swipe gestures 
len ratingthree Swiping down reloads the page and swiping from either side sends you back and forth through pages 
len ratingthree These seem like intuitive features but they really just get in the way and would be much more effective as simple buttons 
len ratingthree Filling out forms on my phone is very risky with these features because one wrong move means I have to start all over again 
len ratingthree If I scroll to the top too quickly the whole page reloads and everything I wrote is gone forever 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingfour When I search for things and I go to delete them it says I did not search for it but is shows on my search history that s how my mom saw my history
len ratingone App is useless now 
len ratingone This is an idiotic browser trying to translate pages I selected as my known language pages 
len ratingone An idiot designed it 
len ratingone When opening the tab menu the oldest tab will just randomly open without me touching it 
len ratingone It s extremely annoying and ruining the app for me 
len ratingone Also the news just disappeared on me 
len ratingone App seems to be falling apart for some reason 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingtwo  why does google chrome keep kicking me out of losing all my open windows sessions 
len ratingtwo this is so infuriating 
len ratingtwo it happens every other week or so 
len ratingtwo i should be allowed to leave as many open windows sessions as i want for as long as i want 
len ratingtwo i have them there for a reason either i m not done reading through the page or i want to keep it open to easily get back to it for reference of something 
len ratingtwo please make this stop happening 
len ratingthree Love the synchronization across devices but the latest update shrinks webpage with to the left of the screen when the phone is rotated to landscape and back to portrait 
len ratingone Also seeing this bug on iPhone XR 
len ratingfive Love the read page aloud feature It is precise and clear this is very helpful 
len ratingfive Google app is very helpful when you need help it is accurate and precise 
len ratingone I don t know what happened to Chrome 
len ratingone I ve been using it for years and NEVER encountered any bugs 
len ratingone At least none that I could see or feel 
len ratingone Now I have bugs on desktop and iOS that constantly frustrate me 
len ratingone I have slowly been switching to Firefox and Safari 
len ratingone While it s kinda annoying to switch away from the synchronization of Chrome across devices the bugs in Chrome are just way too unbearable 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingone It s almost as if Google WANTS us to stop using their products 
len ratingfour Closed Windows don t stay closed if you close the app immediately after closing tabs 
len ratingfour Makes it risky to pull up Google Chrome at all at work or school since something that s NSFW could resume 
len ratingone Used to love Chrome but after the bug where the screen shrinks when my phone goes from landscape to portrait I don t enjoy using this browser to search anymore 
len ratingone I will likely switch to another browser because this issue has been going on for over a month with zero fix 
len ratingthree Hello I have iPhone and whenever I rotate my phone and go back to regular way my webpages shrieks and I have to close the app and restart it then it goes to normal view so I hope you are sending update about the issues 
len ratingthree I really like using Chrome in general but the app handles rotation really poorly 
len ratingthree After viewing a page in landscape the width will be incorrectly shrunk on portrait until you reload 
len ratingthree Makes it almost unusable 
len ratingthree Frequently the browser goes from normal view full width to about of it 
len ratingthree Content goes to the left and a vertical strip on the right is just plain empty screen 
len ratingthree Maybe nobody at Google has the new iPhones to fix this inconvenience 
len ratingone The width of displayed content is constantly switching to a size way too small 
len ratingone It s unbelievably annoying and such amateur engineering work on Google s part 
len ratingone Spammy pop ups aren t properly suppressed either 
len ratingone Whenever I close all my tabs out and close out the app all of those tabs come back when I reopen the app 
len ratingone Please fix this really annoying bug 
len ratingone  Thank you for breaking anti trust laws tracking people and having a monopoly on the industry 
len ratingone Disgusting 
len ratingthree It s been almost a month and no updates have gone out for the bugs still present in this app 
len ratingthree Simply explained when in the app if you turn your phone sideways the right side of screen gets cut off and then after turning back to normal it cuts off the left side so now the display will have two sections on the right and left that are cut making me to force close the app and reopen it 
len ratingthree Come on guys this should have been fixed already
len ratingone Fix the app so that it doesn t automatically resize to less than full screen anytime I tilt my phone 
len ratingone It looks like there are other complaints about this too hopefully Google will fix the problem soon 
len ratingtwo Do you ever plan on fixing this 
len ratingtwo If you don t know what I m talking about goodness gracious 
len ratingtwo And this didn t pop up a month ago 
len ratingtwo It s been at least months 
len ratingtwo I figured a huge company like Google would be embarrassed by such a simple bug 
len ratingthree Great browser 
len ratingthree Last week or so window pops up saying unusual activity and wants input 
len ratingthree No way out except delete and reinstall 
len ratingtwo I ve had this happen a few times now 
len ratingtwo For a while I thought I was just forgetting to close tabs it after some experiments tonight I realized that the browser is reopening tabs that I have already closed 
len ratingtwo I will close a tab and then close the browser and when I open the browser again the tab is back open 
len ratingtwo This is annoying and nearly ruined the surprise of a Christmas gift please fix this 
len ratingone  Your a censoring bag of D s 
len ratingone I vow to never sponsor you or any affiliate ever again and we the people will drive your profits into the ground 
len ratingtwo Content width doesn t fill screen constant captchas on incognito mode
len ratingtwo So I loved chrome and it does search for you but if you turn your phone then flip it back upright the margins do not return they shrink everything 
len ratingtwo You are left with an unscrollable field 
len ratingtwo I have tried reinstalling and it didn t correct so there is a bug that google has been taking too long to fix for sure 
len ratingtwo Go with safari until it fixes 
len ratingthree Love chrome 
len ratingthree Recent bug makes it a chore to use 
len ratingthree I ve noticed occasionally usually due to rotating the page will shrink to the size and stick to the left side 
len ratingthree I ve tried rotating and zooming in but the only way to fix it is to close the page and search again 
len ratingthree Google has been my go to browser for porn and other things but after I rotate it back it glitches out and is horribly aligned I don t know if there s a fix to this but it makes reading web pages difficult
len ratingthree  It s no gonna show full content after rotation 
len ratingthree This browser not saving Gif 
len ratingtwo  Every time my phone is in landscape orientation the webpage becomes squeezed or bug out can t zoom huge white space on the right side of the browser 
len ratingtwo C mon chrome team I known things are slow at Google but this is a heartbreaking bug and it destroys my experience of using Chrome absolutely shatters the image that Google makes high quality products 
len ratingtwo Please get this fixed ASAP 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfour Very good I am indianaanaanana so I can see how to become a chrome is very good wood 
len ratingone  Google Slave China 
len ratingone Google is a servant of the Communist Party 
len ratingone Google is a traitor
len ratingone After you go from landscape to normal the screen has a margin of dead space on right side
len ratingtwo Ehh
len ratingtwo  When I open my tabs the one to the top left gets maximized 
len ratingtwo A few other reviews mention this too 
len ratingtwo Come on developers we need a patch update 
len ratingtwo Will switch browsers soon if nothing is updated 
len ratingtwo  The page gets cropped when you rotate the device and back 
len ratingone Every couple minutes every webpage I go to somehow makes everything skinnier and puts white bars on the sides of the webpage 
len ratingone Constantly have to swipe away and reopen to get it back to normal full screen 
len ratingone Very annoying to the point Chrome is useless 
len ratingone After the update pages will shrink and align with the left side of the page 
len ratingone Then if you tilt the phone the page will become HUGE 
len ratingone It is a pain 
len ratingone I ve even started using Safari which I ve always disliked just so the pages won t mess up 
len ratingone It distorts some pages so bad that I can t read text because it gets cut off by Chrome 
len ratingone Fix this people 
len ratingone Um I don t know what happened but the Chrome browser has been glitching ever since the last update so because my browser zooming out on its own when I move the webpage then I can t click on certain spots on the webpage because of that stupid glitch
len ratingtwo This is my favorite browser but honestly the bugs are making it nearly unusable at this point 
len ratingtwo The password recommendations now stop me from completing a form web pages are rendered at only half width even Google ironically and it is the only app that occasionally crashes on this phone 
len ratingtwo It s just a shame because I used to enjoy the ecosystem it provided so much but at this point I can hardly even leverage the ecosystem s advantages due to the poor usability of this software 
len ratingtwo I m going to have to drop it here soon I just didn t want to have to recreate my bookmark library and saved accounts 
len ratingtwo I m left with little option at this point 
len ratingone  My front camera is turning on as I try to use the app this is disgusting and I even turned off my Face ID for the app and my front camera was still turning on as I tried to use chrome
len ratingone Logs me out of everything except google 
len ratingone This has happened on my old MacBook Air but that was an easy fix 
len ratingone This isn t 
len ratingone Until then I am using Firefox 
len ratingone If this continues I will switch to Firefox on my main Gaming Laptop as well 
len ratingone For some reason whenever I close out the app Chrome closes all my tabs 
len ratingone It s happened around times already 
len ratingone First time I thought I had too many tabs open second time I thought it was my fault and that I accidentally pressed the close all tabs button however after the third time with only tabs open and all of them disappear after minutes after I close the app is really annoying 
len ratingone I looked around and it seems that other people are having the same problem but there are no answers on how to help 
len ratingone I am really tempted to just delete the app and try a new one 
len ratingone When I switch my chrome from portrait to landscape it does not scale correctly and the only way to fix it is to close the tab and reopen it 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingtwo I am not sure whats going on with Chrome 
len ratingtwo I can be on a site and lets say I switch page and the screen shifts to the left leaving about an inch of space on the right 
len ratingtwo The only way to fix is either increase screen size or close browser and come back in it 
len ratingtwo Then it happens again 
len ratingtwo Please look into this 
len ratingthree I ve been dealing with this bug for at least two months now and it s kinda ridiculous at this point 
len ratingthree Otherwise one of the best browsers out there 
len ratingone Google is all about censorship now 
len ratingone All the Google app icons are identical and I always launch the wrong one 
len ratingtwo A few months ago I came across a really annoying rendering bug in chrome 
len ratingtwo If you let your phone go to sleep mode with chrome open or if you happen to rotate the device while using it for whatever reason when you come back the contents of all webpages seem letterboxed as in instead of taking up close to of the screen width it seems chrome is telling the site it only has of real estate available 
len ratingtwo This went away for a while but in the last few weeks came back with a vengeance 
len ratingtwo Feels like something that barely got fixed and never tested 
len ratingtwo If this continues I may have to consider finally making the jump to safari as much as I am dreading this option 
len ratingtwo Fix it 
len ratingone App crashed I opend the app again and click restore open tabs then it crashs again 
len ratingone When I reopened it again the restore button did not pop out 
len ratingone Which means all my open tab are gone and I do sync everything to my acc 
len ratingone This is not the first encounter and for sure not the last 
len ratingone Since google never hear our complaints 
len ratingone While using the app a face several bugs and just brush it of since I m lazy to move the data to another browser but this is getting ridiculous 
len ratingone So I have to say bye to chrome for now until they get it right 
len ratingone  Twitter RealAbril
len ratingone I love chrome but I cannot delete my bookmarks they keep coming back and back 
len ratingone It s drives me crazy 
len ratingone I uninstalled and they keep returning 
len ratingone Remove the new new window crap it s wiping out my tabs every time I accidently click on it instead of new tab 
len ratingone The next time I open chrome all my tabs are gone 
len ratingone Has happened numerous times now 
len ratingone Worse thing I ve ever seen in chrome revert it please 
len ratingone Uninstalled
len ratingthree This is an unending annoyance 
len ratingthree Also make it so there s an analogous feature to reader view in safari
len ratingfive I love this app it s way better than safari in my opinion
len ratingthree Landscape issues
len ratingfive  Um it s google just down load it and get rid of bing or yahoo guys
len ratingone Unusable the past month 
len ratingtwo After a search my iPhone will full on freeze up 
len ratingtwo I have to restart my phone for Chrome to be usable again 
len ratingthree Whenever I open to view all of my tabs it will automatically go back to the tab I was just viewing making it impossible to close other tabs or view another tab 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingone Deleting this app after so much disappointment and information spying
len ratingone So many bugs 
len ratingone Surprised this is allowed on App Store
len ratingtwo Update Chrome was ok for a few weeks but the web pages don t display correctly 
len ratingtwo They re about of the normal size and smooshed off to the left 
len ratingtwo The only way to correct it is to reload the page which is a HUGE pain in the butt 
len ratingtwo I guess I m going back to safari again 
len ratingtwo I used to love my Chrome app 
len ratingtwo I bragged about it to everyone I know 
len ratingtwo After the bugs over the past couple weeks though I m heading back to safari 
len ratingtwo Web pages freeze 
len ratingtwo If I turn my phone sideways and then vertical again the screen is zoomed out and everything is tiny 
len ratingtwo Nothing fixes it except closing the tab 
len ratingtwo Half the time when I leave the app even for seconds to check a text it restarts and deletes all the web pages I had open 
len ratingtwo If you head over to read the Google Maps reviews people are saying pretty much the same thing 
len ratingtwo Ever since the update a couple weeks ago google is broken 
len ratingtwo What the heck 
len ratingone It s not working properly since the last update 
len ratingone I m about to switch to a new browser because of this 
len ratingone So sad I seen google became a weapon against its own people 
len ratingone It is censoring every word you looking at 
len ratingone Changing your mind by control search priority 
len ratingone Blocking true information and place lies in front of your eyes 
len ratingone Not even mind to be a guard dog of CCP 
len ratingone So disappointed by this web 
len ratingone Bye forever 
len ratingone I do not need you tell me what I should think 
len ratingone Please add a feature on google chrome where it supports HTML websites 
len ratingone So people can use it on iOS instead of android devices 
len ratingone There is a widely reported bug that needs to be addressed ASAP 
len ratingone Until then I will use Safari 
len ratingone The bug is this when the phone is rotated horizontal and then back to vertical webpages all of them not just badly coded pages display narrow using like of the screen width 
len ratingone You have to close and reopen the app to fix it 
len ratingone Until you rotate the phone again 
len ratingone Don t waist your time
len ratingfive I highly recommend you download this because it has just a totally new version of safari 
len ratingfive Includes all google apps and products 
len ratingfive It also LISTEN TO THIS IF YOUR PARENTS PUT SCREENTIME ON YOUR DEVICE 
len ratingfive Chrome doesn t like work for screentime 
len ratingfive If you have YouTube limit over then you could do YouTube on chrome and nothing happens 
len ratingfive Downtime doesn t affect chrome either 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone I have to switch to safari until chrome gets fixed 
len ratingone Websites don t format correctly in chrome windows anymore so I am constantly have to force quit and restart the app 
len ratingone Looking forward to this getting fixed so I can switch back to Chrome 
len ratingone Chrome is having margin issues on iphone 
len ratingone It cannot be fixed unless I constantly reload the page 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingthree For whatever reason anytime you try to see all open tabs it will automatically open the top left tab without the chance to stop this or just grow all the open tabs 
len ratingthree You can exit the tab and then see all open tabs but why have such a feature in the first place 
len ratingthree Also should be able to optimize for iPhone better 
len ratingone It s way too easy to click close all when using the app 
len ratingone And it s irreversible 
len ratingone Hundreds of tabs can be lost at a single missclick 
len ratingone Did anyone even test this 
len ratingtwo But 
len ratingtwo But what 
len ratingtwo You may ask 
len ratingtwo But 
len ratingtwo But it crashes 
len ratingtwo But it s glitchy 
len ratingtwo But the new update ruined the whole thing 
len ratingtwo You should be disappointed google 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone After the new Apple update I ve noticed the I keep getting the previous pop up safaris after exiting one safari 
len ratingone Or the same safari will continue to pop up with out me tapping it 
len ratingone Still not having a dark mode following iOS setting in late 
len ratingone What year is it did chrome a product manager time traveled from 
len ratingthree I recently upgraded to iOS and noticed the browser reformists pages where the width is about smaller than normal 
len ratingthree No other changes but it is annoying and I have to close the session and reopen to the page again to get it back to normal with 
len ratingfive Google is the best ever it s better then a Lamborghini
len ratingfive  I like watching porn on this app
len ratingthree When I downloaded this app 
len ratingthree It said payment accepted 
len ratingthree Does this mean it charges you for regular usage like random searching 
len ratingthree I know it can lead to other options that may charge you 
len ratingthree But why does it say payment accepted when you download this app 
len ratingthree I just wanna make sure that it s not charging me when I m just using it for searching like I would with any other search engines that are free 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingone Whenever I look at the tab overview the tab that shows on the top left of my screen is automatically selected and all of a sudden that s the tab that gets maximized 
len ratingone This is an annoying bug 
len ratingone Please fix this Soon 
len ratingone I won t continue to use chrome with this issue 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone I don t know how you are allowed to torture people the way you do with the Pop Up Install Google Widget Ad that you have imbedded in games on iPhones ever since they were at iOS 
len ratingone We are now at and it has only gotten more abusive 
len ratingone Every other ad allows you to block it for cause 
len ratingone Your ad does not 
len ratingone It plays up to times a day 
len ratingone The volume is screaming loud 
len ratingone It will not let you mute it until you have punched the mute key times 
len ratingone I am so angry at you that if I could do without ALL GOOGLE PRODUCTS I WOULD PERMANENTLY DELETE THEM FROM ALL MY iPHONES IPADS AND COMPUTERS 
len ratingone After I installed iOS your ads blissfully stopped for a few minutes 
len ratingone Now they are popping up mid game and playing over and over 
len ratingone If you stop the ad and cancel it it just starts up all over again 
len ratingone This screamingly annoying ad has played over times in December alone 
len ratingone I have begged the game developers to do something but they insist they have no control 
len ratingone I even contacted Apple to report the Ad 
len ratingone They also say they can do nothing 
len ratingone PLEASE REMOVE THIS AD or FIX IT DO IT CAN BE BLOCKED 
len ratingone I was tempted to load your widget the st time I saw the ad but now on principal I won t do it 
len ratingone You should read the nasty comments people are making about this ad 
len ratingone I think you are violating some kind of federal rules 
len ratingone If I can I plan on reporting your company 
len ratingone I am also telling the game developers that unless they do something I will permanently delete their game 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingtwo Works really great most of the time but bugs over the past month or so keep closing the app on my phone and closing all of my tabs without giving me the option to restore them 
len ratingtwo It happened times today alone 
len ratingone Recently pages are displayed with improper framing are off center or scroll horizontally 
len ratingone Whatever they changed recently has completely turned me off chrome for ios 
len ratingone This is terrible 
len ratingone I feel like this app has really been going down hill lately 
len ratingone The latest bug which constantly puts pages out of alignment is the last straw 
len ratingone Switching to another browser 
len ratingfour I believe that I have This already 
len ratingfour Great app
len ratingone More useless than anything I can think of 
len ratingone You are a waste of space and I hope you go bankrupt and I never have to see your stupid logo ever again
len ratingfive It s really awesome how everything is on this website I mean there is everything literally I love it soooo much 
len ratingtwo While chrome is easy to use and a fine browser it has given me lots of issues with alignment 
len ratingtwo Whenever i rotate my phone to watch a video it misaligns when it goes back to the portrait orientation 
len ratingtwo This issue has showed up on multiple websites which makes me think app problem instead of site problem I hope this issue is fixed with an update soon i would like to go back to chrome as my default browser 
len ratingone PLEASE give us an option to confirm with an are you sure on the close all tabs button 
len ratingone I didn t realize I had lost all my tabs and now I can t recover them all because I can t see my full list of tabs that closed 
len ratingone No I don t want to see full history 
len ratingone I want my f ing tabs back 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS 
len ratingone I m just a hair away from moving to Brave permanently instead 
len ratingone Daniel Crespo need my test result
len ratingone  Google s leadership has aligned with the political left to suppress news facts and opinions and suppress free speech and freedom of the press 
len ratingone This means they are anti American 
len ratingfive Best site ever and Good mini games
len ratingone When I forgot my password I tried to make a new one but it told me my birthdate was rong
len ratingfive  Bing
len ratingtwo Whenever I close Chrome on my iPad Pro all my tabs will disappear after a day 
len ratingtwo I m not using incognito mode or anything 
len ratingtwo This has been happening more often in recent months 
len ratingtwo There isn t an option to bookmark all open tabs and there is no longer an option to restore all tabs from the last session 
len ratingone Scrolling will stick amp empty columns panes are appearing 
len ratingone Has been doing so for the past month 
len ratingone New phone 
len ratingone New install 
len ratingone Not limited to specific websites 
len ratingone This is wild that this bug has gone on for this long amp has been reported by many others 
len ratingfive I am only downloading chrome because I want a banner for my channel and all the videos say that you need Google chrome
len ratingone  Fix it 
len ratingone Used to be way better 
len ratingfive I love it so much i can talk to my friends call them and all that u should definitely get this 
len ratingfive It s the best ever 
len ratingfive I love it lol it s the best ever 
len ratingfive I love it lol it s the best ever 
len ratingthree It s been some time now that Chrome has been unable to handle a simple rotating of the phone between portrait and landscape 
len ratingthree This is a basic feature that mobile browsers have been doing for a decade so I m surprised there s been no update with a bug fix 
len ratingthree I m actually using Safari a lot more these days 
len ratingthree  I love the app but the pop up blocker doesn t seem to be working at all very annoying please please please please please allow extensions for chrome for iOS that would help tremendously because I hate getting pop ups while searching also the app keeps on pushing to the left so it s not aligned properly it s really annoying and at least a white bar gap all the way to the right
len ratingthree on google setting doesn t have like Android setting advance what the heck are you racist ios user 
len ratingfive Y all hating too much
len ratingfive eee
len ratingone  MgmgmgmlymmntgjtjbhfngjyhjgZdghhjmmmjgxzxzfthjjunzx
len ratingone This started happening recently and I m about done with chrome over this annoyance that I don t care to deal with 
len ratingone If you close all your tabs the next time you open chrome it will automatically open the most recent tab you viewed 
len ratingone Total trash and google can boos my teez
len ratingfive Love it don t be mad to many people is doing come so that s why it keeps crashing 
len ratingfive Btw all y all bums
len ratingone How to update it
len ratingfive  I believe the article has already described the obvious 
len ratingfive The challenge is how to respond to this now that Trump has apparently lost all chances to recoup 
len ratingfive The severe hack that s been discovered is either a ploy by our CIA Or more likely a signal of their all too obvious incompetence 
len ratingfive However America always proves resilient and adapt beautifully to severe challenge 
len ratingfive Despite our many missteps in the past we always seem to have the American get up and go they can solve any problem 
len ratingtwo My favorite thing about my iPad right now is that it s sort of a more lightweight device I use casually not doing something for work or school in place of my computer 
len ratingtwo Right now Chrome on iPad isn t doing it for me because the tab bar and omnibox look clunky compared to Safari and Chrome on Desktop as well as the fact that the user agent on Chrome seems to be behind that of Safari on iPad making it a pain to get some sites to load their desktop version properly 
len ratingone Constantly crashes freezes and deletes tabs 
len ratingone Lost count how many times it s crashed and when went to restore none of previous tabs were in the history 
len ratingone Google needs to get their act together 
len ratingone They used to make great things but everything they make seems to be failing 
len ratingone I use Chrome on my phone because I have loved it for years but its behavior has gotten so bad I m using Safari more and more 
len ratingone And don t get me started on the utter failure of Chromecast 
len ratingfive I am and this web browser is the best there is barely any pop ups and it is so easy to use I can do anything on it 
len ratingthree I have been using Google Chrome for years but personally I think that it isn t as good as Safari 
len ratingthree Safari makes features much easier to use such as saving GIFs or downloading files 
len ratingthree Plus Chrome crashes a lot and I don t get this same problem with Safari or other browsing apps 
len ratingfive It s the best app in the whole entire world well maybe for googling up I love it so much because the update to
len ratingone  Align is not properly set for new iPhone 
len ratingone what gives 
len ratingone last update was weeks ago for Chrome 
len ratingone Cmon Google we expect more from you 
len ratingone And get a reader mode already 
len ratingfive Nimni
len ratingone chrome can access objectionable user generated content and must be removed from the app store 
len ratingone GFY
len ratingone When i open app and open some tabs it change automaticly tabs
len ratingone It s very great chrome is a great app but it keeps kicking me out every time I open it up to search up things and it keeps kicking me out I tried going in and out re downloading it but it still kicks me out and I don t know why
len ratingthree It used to be great but the constant alignment issues are pushing me to other browser options 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone Will NEVER use chrome again 
len ratingone I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TRUST GOOGLE WITH MY iPHONE PASSWORD 
len ratingone They are huge worldwide too easy for them to be hacked or for rogue employees to steal it amp to hijack your phone to use for any reason amp steal fraudulently use all of your info 
len ratingone ALL I WANT TO DO I PLAY WAY OF THE NETHER FOR JAVA EDITION ON MY LAPTOP 
len ratingone BUT WHEN I SEARCH FOR THE DOWNLOAD PAGE AND SPECIFICALLY SAY JAVA EDITION IT JUST PULLS UP DOWNLOADS FOR PE OR BEDROCK EDITION 
len ratingone AND IT ONLY PULLS UP PAGE FOR JAVA AND WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT SAYS NO PREVIEW AVAILABLE 
len ratingone ARE 
len ratingone YOU 
len ratingone KIDDING 
len ratingone ME 
len ratingtwo Chrome app will regularly ruin your life by shutting down without warning and losing every tab they don t appear in history unless you visited recently and no way to find them based on device 
len ratingtwo Terrible glitch that is very basic
len ratingtwo You know what I m talking about 
len ratingtwo The webpages start to smush to the left leaving a big ol white bar to the side 
len ratingtwo Knot align etc etc 
len ratingtwo how to revert to old version cuz this blows major something something 
len ratingone Before this current version it was very easy and pleasant to use 
len ratingone Now whenever I quit my app it closes all my open tabs and there s no way to restore them 
len ratingone I lost so many tabs 
len ratingone And apparently people are also having the exact opposite problem 
len ratingone What is going on 
len ratingone Also when you rotate your screen orientation and then rotate it back the screen is weirdly zoomed out and your page is floating in the middle 
len ratingone How did so many things get messed up in one update 
len ratingfour It s hard enough today without having to worry about tomorrow the past however as small are incredibly transparent as history allows it to appear is more than we will ever know 
len ratingfour Unless you literally have the power to retain everything you see you hear are what you think is going on without fact there is only fiction 
len ratingfour That s why we always need everyone to work with everyone no matter the outcome of tomorrow 
len ratingfour Because tomorrow isn t promised yesterday s are just that yesterday 
len ratingfour Today is here 
len ratingfour Let s fight for tomorrow to come together 
len ratingfour The privacy offered by this sight is an excellent way to begin 
len ratingone  Google is run by liberal trash 
len ratingone I have deleted and reinstalled chrome twice and it continues to mess up 
len ratingone I search something close the tab close the app and the next time I go to use the app the last thing I searched is still open 
len ratingone It s not a big deal to most but I feel like it s draining my battery and making my OCD go crazy 
len ratingone I am going to find a new browser because this bothers me to no end 
len ratingone  I feel like this app has really been going down hill lately 
len ratingone The latest bug which constantly puts pages out of alignment is the last straw 
len ratingone Switching to another browser
len ratingthree  Some people I know just don t get there is privacy for a reason it s for you to do as you please I m your device if there is any one that could help me get rid of hackers who have there devices connect thru iTunes to connect to my iPhone using ads google services I would greatly love some advice on to how to get thru there heads that I know who they are and I m willing to place each one of them in prison because I m so very sick to death of my iPhones getting hit with the crash reports wanna know there names ok so Donna Lopez Bowser live in Tucson az her husband Toby Bowser their son his step son Alvino Lopez and my grandsons mom Kirsten Oslander and if she doesn t turn them in then I guess I will have to do with her in tow see this is how we gonna do things for now on drop there names all over where doors will be opening I do have to get notice since I ve been unseen unheard by the rest of the world
len ratingone  Whenever I look at the tab overview the tab that shows on the top left of my screen is automatically selected and all of a sudden that s the tab that gets maximized 
len ratingone This is an annoying bug 
len ratingone Please fix this Soon 
len ratingone I won t continue to use chrome with this issue 
len ratingone Chrome web store won t work 
len ratingone It says it isn t compatible with this version of Chrome and to download the latest version 
len ratingone I have the latest version 
len ratingone I can t download any extensions now 
len ratingthree On the Google app every time I search something on dark mode the search results are in dark mode 
len ratingthree This is the opposite for Chrome 
len ratingthree I would appreciate it if this was also implemeted into your app as it has been to the Google app 
len ratingthree It hurts to have to search anything on Chrome at night because it burns my eyes 
len ratingfive Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it
len ratingone  Crushes on iPad all the time for the past months erasing all open Tabs and not a single option to Re Open All Recent Tabs on iOS or Android 
len ratingone After crushing it does try to display an option to reopen but if it crushes again User is completely out of luck 
len ratingone There used to be years ago in an option in History to reopen Tabs and it was there Always present but that option is taken away 
len ratingone Most Useful Feature existing in Chrome in desktop no longer exists 
len ratingone There is no longer Restore Recently Closed Tabs Option in Chrome History 
len ratingone History Syncing with other devices does not fully work 
len ratingone Please restore both and I would give star rating 
len ratingone Then at least if browser crushes all Tabs don t restore from briefly vanishing Restore option then a User has great oldest useful option to go to History and Click from three Restore Recently Closed Tabs by Date and device All Tabs Preview keeps Jumping to a different Tab forward and does lose Currently Open Tab I was on 
len ratingone Immediately after clicking on All Tabs Preview it closes such Preview in seconds and just Hops and Jumps to Open a completely different previously viewed Tab 
len ratingone Font Size Adjustments and Accessibility settings don t exist maybe to help deter any users who don t have Eagle Eyes and wear glasses 
len ratingone Force Zoom on Page does not stay on after a Botched Release and instead keeps resizing text back to Supertiny size Unreadable to the point it s larger to read on an old Android 
len ratingone Dynamic Text Sizing and System Text Size are not supported either 
len ratingone It used work on some pages months ago and now after several releases it s broken 
len ratingone On Google Play Store hundreds of Users report Stability Issues being unable to Open or Close Tabs even currently open Tabs being unable to use Chrome for nearly months after botched releases 
len ratingone Revert Chrome to what it was a year ago 
len ratingone Don t waste time on what does not need fixing 
len ratingone Especially if due to recent challenging times you don t have the same resources 
len ratingone Tip to a Developer Blackout unsuccessful releases and don t ignore numerous users giving you Feedback for Years 
len ratingone  Google is not very stable I ve had to resort to DuckDuckGo BING and FOXZILLA 
len ratingone Algorithms are geared for non Americans 
len ratingthree  It is ok not bad but I like the google app more
len ratingone it started crashing over and over again and reinstalling didnt work fix your app
len ratingone  To big for their pants 
len ratingone They interfered with a presidential election 
len ratingone Scandalous 
len ratingone SHAME 
len ratingone Go to duck duck go
len ratingone Every time I accidentally rotate my phone horizontally and rotate its back vertically the web page goes to half of the screen it s very annoying 
len ratingone Google please fix this it s been going on for months stop interfering in politics and fix your own companies problems
len ratingtwo I hate when it does the auto refresh it a ways makes me have to restart everything
len ratingone They always find a way to look at your recent search history even on incognito they still see and then who knows what they can do 
len ratingone For as little as we know they might even sell it to another company 
len ratingone  Fix your dang browser 
len ratingone The alignment issue is so annoying 
len ratingone You re one of the crappiest multi billion dollar companies ever
len ratingtwo Since the last update I m experiencing a strange bug where almost every page zooms out slightly ish and then floats within the browser frame 
len ratingtwo It s a minor annoyance most of the time but on some things like PDFs I m also experiencing strange snap backs to the top and unexpected zoom in out when trying to scroll 
len ratingone Open a page and close and then restart chrome 
len ratingone The previously closed page is still open Do the testers even test this before releasing
len ratingtwo The app worked perfectly for my phone until the recent update 
len ratingtwo Now it lags I can t scroll down too far or the web page gets stuck and I need to close out of the app 
len ratingtwo Sometimes I need to literally restart my phone to get the app to work again even for a simple google search 
len ratingone  Literally all ads 
len ratingone It s no longer a search browser 
len ratingone Dust pages are all ads 
len ratingone Then they give you search results on the th page 
len ratingone th page all ads 
len ratingone So glad we have other options 
len ratingone It s to the point the browser is useless 
len ratingone The screen margin issues in Chrome have been ongoing for quite some time now 
len ratingone I can search google and find info saying this has been resolved as of version but I still have the problem now with the latest version 
len ratingone I m now using an iPhone Pro with latest iOS 
len ratingone What s sad is I haven t used an iPhone since the iPhone and can recall a similar issue back then 
len ratingone Desktop version of Chrome also has bad margin issues 
len ratingone This can be recreated by clicking on the Google logo from the main search page on desktop Chrome 
len ratingone Very obvious issues that have never been fixed 
len ratingone Why Google 
len ratingone Recent tabs not so recent hours and counting to sync Needs Omni bar to perform find in page function like safari
len ratingone App freezes resets and reloads way too often 
len ratingone The news stories are completely bias and repetitively cherry picked from the same outlets over and over again 
len ratingone Functionality bleh Eye Appeal bleh Connectivity to apps within the same developing group okay at best 
len ratingone This is not a good web browser it s just what people are used to 
len ratingone  Deleting my review when I close a window and reopen it instead of going to a blank page it open last tab 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone You can tap Chrome menu and then Settings and turn off Article Suggestions 
len ratingtwo There is no reader mode back to safari 
len ratingone I ve been using chrome for years now 
len ratingone A bug has started to happen last few weeks 
len ratingone Whenever the screen orientation changes the entire webpage shifts to the left side of the screen 
len ratingone The bug will persist until the app is closed and reopened 
len ratingone Upon reopening everything is fixed until the screen orientation changes again 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone Pages get messed up when rotating from horizontal back to vertical 
len ratingfour Honestly I m a big fan of Google Chrome since I had it on my iOS it s really good 
len ratingfour But the only thing wrong with his all the shortcuts it gives you 
len ratingfour I mean Facebook 
len ratingfour Who wants Facebook on Google Chrome that is making children sign into Facebook 
len ratingfour That s really weird 
len ratingfour Maybe delete the Facebook shortcut and redo it 
len ratingone  Boyfriends cheat on here watching porn
len ratingthree This feature is no longer present in chrome can t imagine why they would do that
len ratingone Safari is always going to be better than chrome 
len ratingone I can t believe I m here to unload my frustration with a google product 
len ratingone They re usually so terrific 
len ratingone This chrome app though on my iPad is garbage 
len ratingone It crashes constantly and nothing in the google help docs that is supposed to fix the problem actually fixes it 
len ratingone I ve installed twice and deleted I guess forever 
len ratingone Conversely it works like a champ on my MacBook Pro 
len ratingone Unbelievable 
len ratingfive  I highly recommend yo download this because it has just a totally new version of safari 
len ratingfive Includes all google apps and products 
len ratingtwo Feels super outdated compared to Edge and Safari 
len ratingtwo Please takes tips from it 
len ratingtwo I need chrome for my Work and School profiles 
len ratingtwo UI is trash on iPad the tabs are hideous 
len ratingone  I hate school and we need this for it that s why 
len ratingfive  I just use for porn
len ratingone  Rip off google 
len ratingtwo When there is a update available the app is useless and crashes constantly forcing you to update 
len ratingone If you rotate to landscape mode and then back to normal mode the website doesn t scale back to normal size and it is zoomed too far in or out 
len ratingone This was fixed before and happening again 
len ratingtwo I online shopped on the chrome app for various things like ordering food ordering from sephora and after i try checking out it all goes to crap 
len ratingtwo I m using an iphone pro max and I realized it wasn t the websites problems but chromes 
len ratingtwo when i tried to check out for my food order it took me to a loop of the same checkout screen 
len ratingtwo When i try to use paypal to check out i can t scroll to the bottom to confirm my purchase 
len ratingtwo idk what happened or if chrome can t keep up with the newer IOS but i might have to revert to safari for my shopping needs 
len ratingtwo Yep this is still a bug 
len ratingtwo Like another reviewer said I read it was supposed to be fixed in version 
len ratingtwo I have and still have the issue 
len ratingone  Hi my name is Maleeya but Crome is driving crazy with the glitch so how can I stop the glitch you can t it would stop glitching and it is make me mad 
len ratingfive Chrome is an amazing app and everyone should use it it never crashes and the people who says it does are people with tablets from like years ago 
len ratingfive So overall chrome is my first choice
len ratingone Chrome is my favorite web browser but the iPhone app is extremely slow 
len ratingone A lot of the time I will wait multiple minutes for pages to load or they won t load at all 
len ratingone I ll love chrome again when the app starts working 
len ratingtwo For whatever reason now if I close a tab and then close Chrome whenever I open Chrome back up that tab that I closed opens back up 
len ratingtwo The only way to get around this is to clear my history out which is annoying to do each time I use Chrome 
len ratingtwo Loved chrome but not now 
len ratingtwo latest chrome version on my iPhone IOS won t resize margins correctly when watching videos and changing from landscape back to portrait 
len ratingtwo Margins stay wide and video size too small 
len ratingtwo Tried reloading and same issue 
len ratingtwo Safari is fine 
len ratingtwo May have to go back 
len ratingtwo I watch a lot of videos and read a lot in chrome 
len ratingtwo When I rotate to landscape and back the webpage is permanently zoomed out 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingtwo Really would prefer not to use safari
len ratingone  I use Google Chrome all the time but about two weeks ago the browser started glitching 
len ratingone I d open a search window and as soon as I go to add a second page the browser immediately jumps back to the first page 
len ratingone This happens over and over and I ve had to start using a different browser 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingone I ve made sure there are no updates I haven t done and cleared my browser history but it continues to glitch 
len ratingone Up to this point I absolutely loved Google Chrome 
len ratingfive Update as of This is a very useful app and being able to use passwords you saved on your computer is very useful and having tabs is also very nice 
len ratingfive The interface is pretty okay the only issue is there is not a way to get to bookmarks in the tabs page 
len ratingfive The revert to flat mode is fixed now and my rating is back to stars 
len ratingfive I love this app however as of it has reverted to what reminds me of before the last facelift of chrome from lots of corners and straight lines to rounded edges and search result boxes 
len ratingfive This is ONLY on the ALL results the others like videos books news etc 
len ratingfive results are in the most current looking version 
len ratingfive This is also not in an update the last update for the app was weeks ago 
len ratingfive I will update this review when this is fixed and change my rating to stars 
len ratingfive Update as of Chrome is still in the outdated flat mode 
len ratingfive I have updated my rating to star where before it was stars a whole stars because of the homepage 
len ratingfive Like really Google what is wrong with you 
len ratingfive You know that most people aren t going to come back and update their rating and review like I have been right and you are even advertising your app 
len ratingfive Please read the feedback you are getting in the reviews it comes from the people that use your app 
len ratingfive One though I am able to make it the default browser 
len ratingfour Hey Chrome team Can you please please please bring this and the other dark mode flags to iOS 
len ratingfour chrome flags enable force dark It s really good on the Mac and Windows versions of Chrome and my battery eyes and I would be forever grateful

len ratingthree I m a Chrome fan and an early adopter for iOS 
len ratingthree This is the biggest problem I can remember 
len ratingthree I have read that this was fixed with an update to Chrome but is the version on my iPhone Pro Max and it is still a problem 
len ratingthree Google Chrome has always been my default search engine system I could remember but recently every time my screen rotates the size of the screen changes 
len ratingthree You can t fix it unless you reload the page and then sometimesthat doesn t even work 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingone Resolution of screen rotation changes and doesn t default back to normal 
len ratingone Makes it very wonky and I have to close the tab and reopen it to make it go back to normal 
len ratingone Very annoying and inconvenient

len ratingone I lose all tabs every time I minimize Chrome and often Chrome doesn t recognize it didn t close properly so I can t restore the tabs

len ratingtwo Google and all there ads are awful I hate using goolge
len ratingone  I m so over Chrome right now 
len ratingone Since their beginning they have been my go to browser but after dealing with many months of app crashing and several dozens of lost tabs I m calling it quits 
len ratingone No matter how up to date I kept my phone or my apps or how many apps or background process or tabs I had up or how good my connectivity was it would crash 
len ratingone There was no rhyme or reason for it 
len ratingone Safari has not once crashed on me not once dumped tabs on me but Chrome was getting progressively worse to the point where it was an almost daily occurrence 
len ratingone That should tell you how much I loved Chrome 
len ratingone I dealt with it for so long and so often and lost so much work and still stuck with them over several updates hoping they d fix whatever it was that had started to go wrong 
len ratingone But they haven t 
len ratingone It s gotten worse 
len ratingone So today 
len ratingone I switched fully to Safari and as soon as I siphon everything I need from my bookmarks and history from Chrome I m deleting the app 
len ratingone I m SOOO frustrated 
len ratingone I d like to think that one day I could come back to Chrome after they fix this issue but at this point I don t have enough faith in them anymore to trust that my time and effort will be safe 
len ratingone Just got burned too many times 
len ratingone Chrome has such great potential they just need to fix this issue if they want to be worth the download they need to be reliable again 
len ratingfive OK just to say you can search things you do not know about like look last time i search about space and i got so much new facts and also it help me with my homework and my online classes GREAT APP
len ratingtwo Share information
len ratingthree I do not like this app asking for touch ID in order to fill in the one password I have saved 
len ratingthree I did not consent to this feature and don t appreciate it 
len ratingthree I also can t find a setting to turn it off 
len ratingthree Dumb redundant feature 
len ratingthree Fingerprint needed to access my phone in the first place before you can get to the chrome app 
len ratingfive I have always hated safari because its is hard to use not basic and always have trouble with the tabs 
len ratingfive Since i have iOS i moved Safari to the app library and put chrome in its place 
len ratingfive I have also set it to the default search browser 
len ratingfive I can t live without chrome 
len ratingfive I recommend to use chrome not safari 
len ratingone When the screen rotates from horizontal to vertical the vertical layout is not full screen 
len ratingone This is very annoying visually 
len ratingthree The most frustrating thing right now is when I close out a tab and then close out the app on my iPhone the tab that I closed comes back up when I reopen 
len ratingtwo Every time I jump out of Chrome to perform another task and then come back the browser reloads the entire page 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo It makes me lose my place in the page and reopens and reloads any resource intensive or view obstructing ads I already closed 
len ratingtwo I don t need the entire page reloaded every time I move between apps 
len ratingthree Thumbnails of tabs keep disappearing which is extremely annoying for a productive user like me 
len ratingthree Please fix this
len ratingfive Gorri n Amarilllo
len ratingone Spy app bewareee
len ratingtwo The page cannot realign properly after rotating the phone causing this little half screen debacle that you can t see and doesn t function 
len ratingone  I can t delete my history faster than Opera Touch 
len ratingone Opera Touch is better than this stupid old google browser 
len ratingone Please remove all bugs from this dumb app 
len ratingfive I need to search up stuff but my mom turned restricted mode on so she thinks she won t go to jail 
len ratingfive She doesn t even need to go to jail if restricted mode is off 
len ratingone This has been around for a while now 
len ratingone When you have the orientation lock turned off and go from portrait to landscape and back to portrait the margins get all messed up and everything shifts left 
len ratingone Only happens to the tab you have open 
len ratingone Xs iOS 
len ratingtwo I always preferred chrome over other web browsers but a new bug came around almost every time I open my browser up again my most recent tab I always close my tabs is for some reason re opened and it takes me to whatever website I was on
len ratingfour When rotating the screen to portrait after landscaping there s a bug that zooms the webpage out and moves it to the left side of the screen 
len ratingfour I know there s already another review mentioning this but I just wanted to make this issue more known 
len ratingfour Other than that it works great 
len ratingtwo Tried opening just one tab delete cache closed all Apps running behind updated the App but still crashes endlessly 
len ratingone Whenever it crashes all of my tabs Get deleted I m on ios This has Been going on for years even Before the iOS update
len ratingtwo Constant crashes on iOS sometimes resulting in loss of some or all tabs 
len ratingtwo There is no way to re open closed windows on mobile and trying to re open tabs one by one will result in the same tab changing addresses 
len ratingtwo There should be an option to re open closed windows or a better way to recover data after a crash 
len ratingtwo After losing my tabs and browsing data too many times I ve uninstalled the application and wouldn t recommend it on iOS 
len ratingone So one day I wanted to watch YouTube and then when I tried to go to Chrome kicked me out then I cleared all my apps and it still kicked me out then I restarted my iPad it still did t work 
len ratingone Needs a fix 
len ratingone Once tabs are closed and the app is closed when restarting the closed tabs will reopen 
len ratingone Super frustrating to have to sit through old tabs loading every time the app is opened 
len ratingone Needs a fix ASAP
len ratingfive Works great
len ratingone Why is the age when kids using like google classroom my parents always listen to age thing and did not get this because age is 
len ratingone The only way I was able to download this was because my grandma downloaded it without seeing the age and I use it secretly from my parents so please lower the to i don t know thank you Your fren The person who hates fortnite 
len ratingfour I m not sure if it s a bug or some new annoying thing but recently this has been happening 
len ratingfour Whenever I go out of the app I close out my tabs 
len ratingfour So when I come back to the app those tabs should be gone 
len ratingfour But for some reason they re back even though I had already closed them off 
len ratingfour So that s one irritating thing but then also sometimes I purposely leave a tab open when I close the app because I plan on coming back and in the past it has always kept the tab there but now sometimes I will come and it will have closed off the tab 
len ratingfour I thought this just might be a glitch so I tried deleting the app and re downloading it but that did not work 
len ratingthree I have suggestions which will improve my experience with the app 
len ratingthree I hope give us the option to let each group of the tabs in one color for example Select all news pages in red color because when I open a lot of tabs My time is wasted by opening each tab until find the news or shopping which I had opened before 
len ratingthree I want to block specific websites to stop watching their results of appearing in the search 
len ratingthree I love chrome it s all I use however when I close pages and close the app the pages never fully close so when I reopen the app they reappear which is frustrating 
len ratingthree This app is ridiculously frustrating the bug that gets me the most is when I launch the app and click to see all my tabs in the expanded view it pushes me to a tab without my taping the tab to go there 
len ratingthree Stupid 
len ratingthree And on top of that any website I launch it zooms the page in automatically Just a stupid application
len ratingfive It Is Fine I Don t Have Any Complaints 
len ratingone  Censors you all the time 
len ratingthree  I like Google but the only problems that I find that the other Google search app which would not let me post a review has is to be too jittery and and whenever I look at a picture it both apps show those icons in high right corner thereby blocking the words or parts of the picture that I want to see 
len ratingthree Please remedy this 
len ratingthree When my phone switches to landscape and then back to portrait orientation while I m using chrome the whole window shifts to the left and won t resize 
len ratingthree I have to close chrome complexity to fix 
len ratingthree Refreshing does not work 
len ratingthree I invited my friend to a google classroom but it says her email and phone number was incorrect I check contacts and both were correct 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingthree When I go from landscape to portrait the webpage doesn t stretch to both sides of the screen 
len ratingthree Tapping the address bar and then tapping cancel fixes the problem 
len ratingthree Also needed a dedicated bookmarks star on the navigation menu 
len ratingthree There s no reason I should have to tap the ellipses first as there s plenty of real estate to put an icon
len ratingtwo When I have second time to punch in or out and you add a sec of unnecessary security steps that make me want to delete this app and forget i ever need it 
len ratingone Chrome was my favorite browser on iOS 
len ratingone That last several updates have made it buggy slow and crashes a lot making me lose my tabs I had open 
len ratingone I d say they need to fix it but they don t seem to care 
len ratingone I did star to be mean
len ratingone Please fix this browser 
len ratingone It always disconnects me from WiFi 
len ratingone I don t want a cellular bill that s sky high 
len ratingfive This is way better than safari and way easier to use 
len ratingthree  So I used Chrome for pretty much all my hobbies when I had an Android but since I switched to and iPhone Chrome doesn t function as well so I pretty much sticked with Safari even though it s more complex to use 
len ratingtwo Chrome is my fav browser hands down but i can no longer download files from the browser 
len ratingtwo When i click download on something image music video instead of it saying download at the bottom it just opens the file in another tab 
len ratingtwo I then try to longpress on the file image music video nothing happens no pop up options at all 
len ratingtwo When i switch to safari and try to so the same thing i have zero issues downloading the file 
len ratingtwo I didn t use to have this issue i was able to download whatever without any issues and chrome was perfect no complaints but this right here needs to be fixed 
len ratingtwo I don t want to have to keep switching between browsers every time i have to download something 
len ratingone FIX THE ROTATING ISSUE 
len ratingone IT S REALLY ANNOYING HAVING TO FORCE CLOSE THE APP FOR THE SIZING TO BE NORMAL AGAIN IT S REALLY ANNOYING 
len ratingone  Untrained 
len ratingone I took my month old golden doodle Moni to Dacula Grooming Saturday morning at am for a bath grooming before my fathers wedding in which Moni was the flower girl 
len ratingone They called me to pick her up around and when I arrived they told me she did great 
len ratingone I paid and off we went back to the wedding in order to finish getting ready 
len ratingone As soon as we arrive I noticed blood on my car seats and Moni s ear 
len ratingone I got her out of the car to clean her up and while doing so I noticed her ear is clipped and bleeding 
len ratingone I then look down to see my dogs paw is saturated in blood 
len ratingone While cleaning her paw I noticed a substantial amount of blood was gushing from her nails 
len ratingone The groomer didn t cut just one nail too short but TWO of them were cut down to the vein 
len ratingone I called the groomers to find out what happened and they proceeded tell me well we clipped her nails and they were bleeding so we put quick stop on them and they were fine by the time you picked her up 
len ratingone First of all I understand things happen but to not tell the owner is totally unprofessional 
len ratingone Again we re not talking about a scratch this poor puppy was bleeding substantially from her paw 
len ratingone I then took her back to the groomers in order to be re cleaned and for them to try and stop the bleeding 
len ratingone At this point the wedding is supposed to start in hours 
len ratingone The girl at the front desk was very apologetic and said she was sorry and that she didn t know anything about it 
len ratingone It s obvious at this point the groomer never told her what had happened 
len ratingone The lady at the front desk assured us the owner was made aware of the situation and assured us she would fix it 
len ratingone As of Tuesday I still had not heard from anybody 
len ratingone My husband calls them Tuesday afternoon in order to speak with the owner and to find a resolution 
len ratingone At this point we simply just wanted a refund and would take our puppy somewhere else 
len ratingone After much discussion she agrees to giving us back only half of the money 
len ratingone Unfortunately the owner seemed to care more about the profits then she does a member of your family 
len ratingone Not once during this conversation did she apologize on behalf of her staff but continued to say it happens quite often but doesn t normally bleed this bad which is why we weren t told in the first place 
len ratingone It is now Wednesday night and Moni continues to walk with a limp 
len ratingone I believe the way this situation was handled is completely inappropriate and I d hate to know how many other fur babies were hurt without the owners even knowing about it 
len ratingone Ps 
len ratingone These bloody pictures were taken hours later 
len ratingone When her paw was still bleeding and I was able to get an actual picture of what happened 
len ratingone My poor girl 
len ratingone  Why put a period in a natural spot for me to press the space bar 
len ratingone If you want a period put it at the top with everything else 
len ratingone This is the worst BEST browser 
len ratingone Absolutely awful 
len ratingone Stupid in every way 
len ratingone Until they fix the problem
len ratingthree No longer able to share a page via gmail 
len ratingthree Not sure what s going on 
len ratingone Like many other bad reviews this app was really good 
len ratingone But I noticed after my update from iOS to the chrome app became very unstable 
len ratingone Websites are out of ligament after moving from portrait to landscape mode which has been going on for a while now 
len ratingone You seriously can t ask people to make this app their default browser when you can t fix issues that users have complained about for months 
len ratingone Your developers need to get to the bottom of this fast 
len ratingfive  I do not have all tho if I had there were glitch I would be angry
len ratingone A long time user of google I m out 
len ratingone So sad to see what has been happening after you switch to a private browser that doesn t track your every move 
len ratingtwo Suddenly I m unable to save GIFs to my iPhone after the latest iPhone update but only in Chrome I can still do it in Safari 
len ratingtwo So I guess I ll be switching back to that for awhile until this bug gets fixed 
len ratingfour  Make appointment for this doctor Ahmet Ozaktay 
len ratingfour Understands my pain 
len ratingfour Handles complicated cases 
len ratingfour Only gives you what you need 
len ratingfour Intelligent and caring 
len ratingfour Retsky
len ratingthree  In the new update you literally can not make a new book mark like come on how do you forget to add the most obvious features 
len ratingthree Smh add it back
len ratingtwo Used to love it but now your app makes it harder to use saved passwords so I m going back to Safari 
len ratingtwo Many sites already remember my password so I was in with one tap 
len ratingtwo But your password manager makes it take several taps 
len ratingtwo Not too bad I could live with that 
len ratingtwo But now after an update you won t even let me use saved passwords unless I put a passcode on my device 
len ratingtwo It never leaves my house I don t want one and it should be my decision 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating 
len ratingthree At first I thought it was sites that were ad heavy like recipe blogs but now Chrome is crashing on even like the Walmart website 
len ratingone  Terrible 
len ratingone Just terrible 
len ratingfive  I like turtles
len ratingone WORST APP EVER IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE 
len ratingone  Hello Team On iPad when I long tap on a YouTube video for popup menu for Copy Link etc 
len ratingone and tap Copy Link it copies the link but when I tap in an empty area later to dismiss the popup menu the current page navigates to the link even though I did not tap on the link 
len ratingone  When I long tap on a YouTube video and select Open in a New Window it opens the video in a new tab but the current page also navigates to the same video page and now I have two pages playing the same video 
len ratingone  When I long tap an external link on YouTube and choose Open in New Window it opens pages of the same link 
len ratingone  When I tap on a external links on YouTube videos it opens TWO windows going to the exact same link 
len ratingone  let s say I was on Yahoo a and then surfed to YouTube homepage b I surf to a video c and tap Back button and it goes back to the current video page c not previous YouTube homepage b and the history is lost 
len ratingone If I tap Back again to force it to go to YouTube homepage b it goes back to the Yahoo page a skipping YouTube homepage b 
len ratingone If I tap the forward button to go to YouTube homepage b it goes to the video page c skipping YouTube homepage b but does not go to YouTube homepage b 
len ratingone  The above behaviors are manifest on iPad with iOS and only on YouTube 
len ratingone Links and popup menu actions work as usual outside YouTube on iPad 
len ratingone This was working fine before by you folks broke it 
len ratingone I reported these frustrating issues to you several times in the last one year but no resolution so far 
len ratingone Apparently my complaints fell on a deaf ear 
len ratingone Because of these issues I can only view one video at a time by tapping on the video and when I go back to the previous page the other videos I wanted to watch on it are gone because the feed changed based on my watch history 
len ratingone I ll gladly revise my rating if you resolve these issues 
len ratingone Cheers 
len ratingone MobileMusic
len ratingone Same off center margin issues others have reported with iPhone 
len ratingone Will switch to Safari until this is fixed 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingthree On my iPad the chrome app crashes here and there what would happen is I ll being using chrome for whatever purpose I needed to use it and then and random times it ll crash the iPad will go into a loading screen and I would have to put in my password again go back on the app and all the tabs that were open would be closed but it ll give me a notice saying chrome didn t close properly then I would click restore and it ll bring my tabs go back but it s annoying so pleas fix it
len ratingfive I believe Google Chrome is one of the best apps to have ever been made 
len ratingfive I ve used it repeatedly during college 
len ratingfive It has been great asset for the completed college class assignments 
len ratingfive as an author I have used Different features that are offered it has been awesome thank you to the creator 
len ratingone Ok seriously can y all put the close all button in the settings tab so I don t accidentally click it 
len ratingone Or at least give an option to open all your previous tabs like on the desktop version 
len ratingone Not to mention all the crashing that closes all the tabs and can t be opened up again 
len ratingone Just awful and annoying 
len ratingone All my tabs are gone now 
len ratingtwo  close toonami 
len ratingone  Not good
len ratingfive Although saved passwords are synched autofilled passwords not working
len ratingone i open anything on chrome and it takes forever to load and the age rating is stupid 
len ratingone use safari 
len ratingfive The update fixed my lag now my work can easily be done
len ratingfive  It s good peroid 
len ratingtwo Crashes constantly so i use safari
len ratingfive  Exactly what the last Chick said 
len ratingtwo I have all the settings correct for auto fill but chrome doesn t auto fill anything 
len ratingtwo So bloody annoying 
len ratingfive  Yy
len ratingtwo Cannot download a file specially powerpoints etc 
len ratingtwo I feel this is more of an embarrassing limitation of the platform but it still makes the whole application that much more lackluster 
len ratingone With the latest version push close all the tabs and exit the browser 
len ratingone Now remove the browser app from background ensuring the app starts fresh instance next time 
len ratingone Now open the browser app Ta Da 
len ratingone It shows you back the previously closed browser and doesn t look like it s terminating the previous closed navigation 
len ratingone To go past this issue just open and close a new tab multiple times 
len ratingone Quit and reopen the browser app again 
len ratingtwo Didn t realize that I couldn t cast the screen like on my laptop to Chromecast 
len ratingtwo How do you not have that functionality
len ratingone I have to restart the app so many times because it keeps crashing 
len ratingone I m forced to recover my tabs every single time 
len ratingone Every time I try to read an article or watch a video it crashes or shuts down 
len ratingone This wasn t like this before and now it crashes seconds after you open it 
len ratingone Not recommended
len ratingone Any page that has even a single ad on it will slow down browsing reposition the page to center on the ad at any given moment and will nine times out of ten just give a page crashed error 
len ratingone Let us use extensions or put an ad blocker in 
len ratingone AMP links are also trash 
len ratingone Holy smokes this app is super buggy 
len ratingone I went from a Google Pixel XL Android and chrome was fantastic 
len ratingone But on IPhone Pro it s a disaster 
len ratingone What is going on over at Google 
len ratingone I feel like I have to use Safari now as my browser 
len ratingone The new update is killing me
len ratingthree Like many others the web page margins shrink after moving from landscape to portrait 
len ratingthree This has been happening for several weeks and I am switching to Safari 
len ratingone Hi this would be a five star app but I had the same app and at one point it was gone when I was in YouTube please fix it thanks
len ratingtwo DO NOT mandate me to use lock features 
len ratingtwo Nothing works 
len ratingthree  the app has been crashing unexpectedly and randomly crashes for months on end for me and I don t know weather or not the app can t handle all the searches I do on the actual app itself or my iPad Pro can t handle the searches from the Chrome app leading to a crash 
len ratingthree And for further notice it s been behaving like this for me for years now and my perspective is the Chrome app can only handle limited searches were the desktop version can handle nearly insane amounts of searches depending on the laptop or computer and experiencing sudden random crashes almost makes me think weather the Chrome app has a hidden bug or something like that or an hidden virus possibly 
len ratingthree So developers do the best of your knowledge to fix and repair it now please because it gets on my nerves if something doesn t work properly 
len ratingfive As accurate and easy browser
len ratingone  I was using Google s services for many years but since latest updates and annoying popups for cookies etc 
len ratingone it s time to move 
len ratingone I already replaced almost all Google s apps only gmail left but I m on the move to my own domain and some other email provider 
len ratingone Goodbye Google I hope you ll start listen to users someday in the future 
len ratingtwo  PUT THE SEARCH BUTTON BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM OR SO HELP ME
len ratingfour I ve been using this app on iOS for years but after the latest update it has become laggy 
len ratingfour I m using an iPhone maybe I just need to upgrade 
len ratingtwo Going from landscape to portrait messes with the margin of the pages which can make viewing pages unbearable 
len ratingone When you tilt the phone from landscape to portrait mode chrome shrinks the webpage so it s of the screen width 
len ratingone Only way to fix is to refresh the page but that loses where you are on the page 
len ratingone People have been having an issue with this for up to a year and it hasn t been fixed 
len ratingone I deleted your app today 
len ratingone Your filtering have lost you credibility
len ratingfour Web browser is fine however whenever I use the app on my new Pro Max I can feel the phone heat up and eventually get hot to the touch 
len ratingfour Also makes the battery drain quicker due to the heat 
len ratingfour This is the only app that causes my phone to do this and it s slightly concerning 
len ratingthree Chrome is a good app and all but it keeps shutting down and then it says it shutter down incorrectly and that s starting to annoy me 
len ratingthree When y all fix it I m going back to chrome 
len ratingthree After updating to IOS and noticed that my Google gives problems 
len ratingthree Sometimes I have to start switching between Cellular Data and my home WiFi until it works 
len ratingthree The problem is that when I am not near the wifi I cannot use it either 
len ratingthree What s going on 
len ratingthree I need to remove it and find some other app that will do the job 
len ratingone  Trouble displaying multiple tabs without constant random reloads 
len ratingone Does not work with apple keyboard 
len ratingone Edited Just gets worse and worse 
len ratingone Now refuses to recognize settings 
len ratingone No integration with other apps even ones produced by Google 
len ratingtwo Why do I suddenly have to put in my pin passcode to access my saved passwords 
len ratingtwo That s pretty counterproductive 
len ratingtwo I saved it for a reason 
len ratingtwo I might as well put in my password if I need to type anything in 
len ratingtwo Your app is broken 
len ratingtwo Flipping from portrait to landscape and back again frequently results in the sizing being messed up page will appear with sizable blank margins on left and right of webpage 
len ratingtwo Also scrolling through pages frequently freezes unresponsive 
len ratingtwo Can scroll up but not down 
len ratingtwo Fix it 
len ratingthree Hi I am and I need to be so I wish I could have the google so I can RoSearch player 
len ratingthree  also I am a Roblox player great game 
len ratingone  Hello Team On iPad when I long tap on a YouTube video for popup menu for Copy Link etc

len ratingfive  very well
len ratingone  Seditious quislings
len ratingthree  There is a really annoying thing that happens in the app 
len ratingthree When ever I switch to a new tab a new window or open the app it would change to a random tab by itself and when I try to go to the tab that I wanted to go on it would sometimes revert back to the same tab it put me on 
len ratingthree  Chrome has been my favorite web browser for years on desktop 
len ratingthree With my new iPhone I am giving it a try on iOS 
len ratingthree At first sight I was amazed by the functionality despite a little bit odd interface design 
len ratingthree I really enjoy the hassle free auto fill in feature that I do on my desktop 
len ratingthree I even set it to be default browser for the first time 
len ratingthree However when I rotate my screen to watch a video 
len ratingthree The bug show starts the webpage start floating around and cannot stay centered 
len ratingthree The video window is pushed low to the iOS task switcher bar 
len ratingthree I cannot even tap the mute icon then 
len ratingthree Things get even worse when I rotate back to vertical 
len ratingthree The webpage is zoomed and poorly aligned to the left 
len ratingthree I cannot fix it even after reloading the page 
len ratingthree I tried these on Safari and none of these occurred 
len ratingthree For long I don t know what is good and special to use safari 
len ratingthree But I don t have big complaints at least 
len ratingthree Now this version of Chrome lets me realize that what a web browser should be like smoothly and stably showing what it is supposed to show and allow the viewers interact with the icon with just one tap 
len ratingthree That being said I hope Chrome team can work on the issues reported by me and other reviewers 
len ratingthree It is supposed to be great 
len ratingfive Chrome is my go to browser 
len ratingfive With iPadOS installed no option exists in settings to select as default 
len ratingfive Can t find a solution in google search 
len ratingfive Right after writing this I was give an update option which I had not seen before and it fixed it 
len ratingone All of a sudden it Doesn t work
len ratingthree i don t like automatic swich browse
len ratingone The issue still exists where if you rotate your screen to landscape and then rotate it back to portrait than its zoomed out like of normal 
len ratingone I still don t get why this bug is back and more than that why it wasn t fixed with the new update 
len ratingtwo Windows remain open even when you close them and hard close the app 
len ratingtwo Even in incognito mode 
len ratingtwo All appears to be closed then there they are when you open a new browser session 
len ratingtwo Bye bye chrome 
len ratingtwo Hello DuckDuckGo 
len ratingone I used it it is way to laggy I don t like it like every time I search something I need to wait a long time
len ratingone It gave me the wrong information 
len ratingone Don t use this app 
len ratingone Or just give it a one star 
len ratingone People I m telling use safari 
len ratingfive  It s good to have chrome because it helps you do your quizzes POD and math review quiz
len ratingfour This is my preferred search engine and I use this ALL THE TIME 
len ratingfour However the new update makes it hard if you have to leave the app and then return 
len ratingfour It adjusts the screen so the right half of chrome and the site you were using is cut off and the only way I have found to adjust it is to exit and then research the site 
len ratingfour I m sure it s just a bug but no way to fix it if no one tells you about it 
len ratingfive Chorom 
len ratingone La descargue a mi tel fono y no me funciona bien para navegar de veras no lo aconsejo 
len ratingtwo  There is a bug where websites get smashed to the side of the screen if you start viewing a website vertically rotate the device sideways to have a wider view then rotate the device back to vertical layout again 
len ratingtwo Use Reddit com mobile site to replicate 
len ratingone  A new issue has developed where any and all incognito tabs that have been recently closed are reopening after closing the app and restarting it 
len ratingone This is a grave security and privacy concern and needs to be fixed immediately 
len ratingfive  Love this app
len ratingfive I have an iPhone XS MAX on iOS 
len ratingfive I have like tabs open 
len ratingfour Ok I love chorded I watch videos on there to but when I watch them there music I have done everting nothing work can you fix it
len ratingone I don t know how they ve done this but there is no way to limit Chrome usage through Screen Time 
len ratingone Under the Always Allowed section it s just not there neither under allowed or not allowed 
len ratingone You d think then that it behaves like Safari in that it respects Screen Time at the site level but nope 
len ratingone When Downtime kicks in anything you d otherwise have limited is instead completely accessible through Chrome 
len ratingone I m surprised Apple tolerates this complete breaking of core functionality 
len ratingtwo When I close the tab and close the app the page which was closed is kept open next time when I open the app that page which I had closed earlier opens up it s a security bug fix it immediately 
len ratingthree With the recent update some webpages like YouTube resize to of what they should be after looking at one video 
len ratingthree Why is this problem back 
len ratingthree On the reopening pages issues if I close a page in either normal or incognito mode I expect them to not re open upon coming back to the app 
len ratingthree This needs to an option we can disable on iOS 
len ratingthree Idk who thought caching our most recent viewed pages in either normal incognito was a good idea but seriously if I wanted to go back to that page again I can just bookmark it like you would normally do 
len ratingone The feature to close all of your tabs is inconveniently located on the bottom left screen 
len ratingone It s easy to accidentally press it and close all of your tabs 
len ratingone However it s even harder to get those tabs back 
len ratingone I have to individually restore every single tab I had previously opened 
len ratingone Unfortunately the app crashed and all of my tabs disappeared permanently not even appearing in my history or full history 
len ratingtwo It sukzzzz
len ratingone  Even though I ve got an iPhone Chrome was my go to browser Until a recent update where it started acting like it was on crack 
len ratingone  And not in a good way 
len ratingone You hit the button to select a window and it pops you over to some random window from before 
len ratingone And its password tracking stopped working correctly 
len ratingone It is absolutely maddening so much that I ve gone back to Safari now 
len ratingone  If I wanted to keep the old tab open I would have done just that 
len ratingone I don t appreciate having to close out the tab I already closed every time I open google chrome 
len ratingone Just an extra unnecessary step 
len ratingone Don t know why anyone thought this part of the update was a good idea 
len ratingthree I love chrome but I hate the fact that if the app refreshes on you it will go to the top of the page instead of where you were it makes reading difficult and I hate that y all changed that 
len ratingone Way too many crashes switches randomly from mobile version to desktop 
len ratingone The desktop version runs horribly on IOS 
len ratingone Recent update is a disaster I m so frustrated Can t even search or type in the url box anymore because this notification banner drops and blocks it over and over every time I tap to type in the URL box 
len ratingone  Chrome pasted from MacBook Pro Chrome pasted from MacBook Pro Chrome pasted from MacBook Pro Chrome pasted from MacBook Pro This has to be a bug right 
len ratingone This is the first time as a lifelong google user I ve considered switching browsers for mobile 
len ratingone It is so frustrating and there s no way to turn it off 
len ratingone I ve searched online in settings can t find anything 
len ratingone Time to try safari I guess 
len ratingone I don t know what happened but I do wanna cry 
len ratingone Literally all my tabs just deleted for some random reason and I don t know if it had to do with my phone but this isn t the first time my tabs have randomly deleted while I m on the app 
len ratingone Like a glitch or something 
len ratingfour The close all button is too easy to hit on accident 
len ratingfour I have lost all my tabs and will have to go through the torturous process of finding all the pages again 
len ratingfour Would like to have the close all option placed behind the to reduce the amount of accidental destruction of my tabs 
len ratingone Searching isn t the same as it was six months ago I can barely find half of the stuff I used to find because of the new censorship
len ratingone Running iPadOS and Chrome refuses to launch
len ratingone I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it just crashes whenever I try to open it 
len ratingfour The latest update has a problem in incognito mode i mean when i use incognito mode for browsing webpage and clear that when I m done and close an app completely next time when i want to use incognito my previous webpages are still there and this is bug 
len ratingone  The news updates are trash 
len ratingone Google Chrome is very slow and freezes all the time 
len ratingfour I tried getting a video to work and the circle just kept going round and round 
len ratingfour The minute I changed to Safari the video worked fast as greased lightning 
len ratingfour Chrome really needs to fix their app where it will get play videos on an IPhone 
len ratingfive best app ever
len ratingone After the most recent update the app keeps crashing when I do a search 
len ratingone It does it for most searches and this is the first time I ve had this sort of issue 
len ratingone Turned off my device uninstalled and reinstalled chrome on an IphoneXSMax 
len ratingone Seems to happen more when searching for locations like walmart or other establishments
len ratingone Lag and hang filled which I m pretty sure are momentary glitches in this release made it unusable 
len ratingone Brave is fine in its place 
len ratingone Good luck on the next release 
len ratingfive I like cheese
len ratingfour It won t even work anymore 
len ratingone  Once again the new update is causing weird zooming issues on pages where they only fill up of the screen 
len ratingone Why is this an issue again after it was previously fixed 
len ratingone Clearly Google needs new testers who know how to do their job 
len ratingtwo With the recent update whenever I open the app it automatically reopens the last tab I had closed basically continuing the last session 
len ratingtwo It does this normal AND incognito 
len ratingtwo Normally you d turn this off through startup settings but iOS doesn t give you the option 
len ratingtwo So you either have to open a new tab and then close the app or don t go to any sites you don t want others to see if they grab your phone to use it 
len ratingtwo Really disappointing that you can t disable this feature on mobile 
len ratingone  google dude I championed for you for so long 
len ratingone But in the past few months when I really need it my always up to date chrome app on my phone is always crashing 
len ratingone I loose all of my tabs that I m working on constantly 
len ratingone Hope I didn t have anything I needed when it crashed again just now 
len ratingthree I don t know what happened on the update but now I close a tab so no tabs are open close my app 
len ratingthree Then when I go back to my app the tab I closed is open again 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingfour Have noticed since the update when i close tabs in incognito mode with the close all option then close the app when i open the app again they re all back 
len ratingthree  The latest version has the rotation bug again that resizes pages incorrectly 
len ratingthree Not sure why this keeps coming back but it really gets in the way of web browsing 
len ratingfive I have been using chrome for a while and it has been only helpful since I use it for educational and personal purposes 
len ratingfive Chrome has become my only search engine and I love it 
len ratingfive It has an amazing setup and it doesn t take forever to load 
len ratingfour I love its overall design it is very smart although it is public
len ratingfive  Google chrome is the best search engine for everyone and why I there is all the hate against the community it s secure and people are lying from google chrome because it s terrible no it s not terrible it s best
len ratingfour I m not a big fan of how the app looks all I m saying is that it looks pretty complicated and chrome wouldn t be the best app for school work 
len ratingfour I still rated it a four for how helpful it is 
len ratingfour Thanks chrome 
len ratingfive I love it it helps with school work
len ratingone Dear Google When I put the Chrome browser icon on my iPad Dock and long press on it I get a Files App like of display showing icons of previously accessed files 
len ratingone I m on iPadOS on a d iPad Pro 
len ratingfour Tab titles are broken they don t show you the full title of the website anywhere 
len ratingfour  If you bookmark the tab or if you access the title using JavaScript with document title then you ll see the tab title is shorter and ends with It is very annoying that I can t see the full title given that literally every other web browser shows the full tab title 
len ratingone  Type in dominionvotingsystems using Google Twitter or Facebook 
len ratingone It s time to speak out against these big companies and the media 
len ratingone We are Dick of Facebook Twitter and Google and their censorship and biased media 
len ratingfive Just sharing my rating 
len ratingfive P I mean chrome is very good and useful especially when you re with friends it help a lot
len ratingone The app won t connect to the internet on my iPhone X I can use Safari fine but when use chrome none of the websites will load 
len ratingfive I like this app because it tells you information about anything
len ratingone  Trouble displaying multiple tabs without constant random reloads 
len ratingone Does not work with apple keyboard 
len ratingone Edited Just gets worse and worse 
len ratingone Now refuses to recognize settings 
len ratingtwo This new update is so laggy and has freezes everywhere 
len ratingone Why can t I translate pages form other languages literally the translate button comes well guess what it comes with gray which you can t press at all like do you thing and fix your policies with China or something Apple have and will never care about foreigners living aboard 
len ratingone Can no longer save gifs they save as static pictures not sure why
len ratingthree Great app but native font increase would be great for folks with bad vision like myself 
len ratingthree I m partially blind but my iPhone is googled out 
len ratingfour Hi my name is Olivia and I am I just rated four star but someone deleted my chrome
len ratingfive  I do not have the YouTube app I can use it on safari but I like it more on chrome because when you see the links that will take you to it that makes it a lot easier
len ratingtwo Love Chrome on every device I have ever used but the last almost months have been nothing but crash after crash 
len ratingtwo I thought it was because I was on Beta but even after removing the beta profile and restarting and then updating my phone it still crashes almost every single time I open it 
len ratingfive It s a better app to be use keep growing the app thanks
len ratingone This app short sircited and stayed in my Home Screen until I went to the apple store and got a hard reset on the phone 
len ratingone Do NOT recommend and home that any other person who wants to use chrome goes to firefox or Microsoft edge 
len ratingone We the American People are tired of censorship 
len ratingone I trying to change my password to verify my account but it won t work this is a ripoff if you can fix this
len ratingfive Chrome is like the best you ll see
len ratingone I just switched to chrome and it erased all my history 
len ratingone Never thought that would happen with google 
len ratingone Eff you guys 
len ratingtwo It keep shutting the app automatically and close all the site 
len ratingthree The app works mostly fine but once every week or so it ll close all of my tabs 
len ratingthree It s inconvenient and starting to get annoying 
len ratingone  G Would Not Be Secure Because Russia Would Be Tracking Our GPS Locations So I m Not Going To Upgrade My Devices 
len ratingone No Internet Means No Breadcrumb Trails Left Behind 
len ratingone When I open the app everything is black and white sorta grayish and then it turns to color 
len ratingone I don t need google s collective opinion 
len ratingone Just give me the results I search for 
len ratingone I recommend looking for a browser without a political agenda 
len ratingone It really seems like in an effort to stay atop google has plummeted to an annoying low 
len ratingone Bookmarks tab switching and more have all been affected adversely from the new update 
len ratingone I am not happy 
len ratingone Others are not happy 
len ratingone Soon more will fall prey to the iOS like mistake of breaking that which doesn t need fixing 
len ratingone I m anxiously looking for a new update that ACTUALLY fixes the bugs along with the recent security flaws 
len ratingone I have a iPhone pro and it is maddening to have it perform like a buggy rd party brick when using chrome browser 
len ratingone I guess I m stuck with safari until this is fixed 
len ratingfour So I have safari and they by they Chrome Google and safari have the same bugs 
len ratingfour I have a friend named Maryam and I have no school today so I wanted to add cute bunnies to a google slide I will try every app I find to that has a browser so please remove errors please 
len ratingthree Have IoS installed on my phone 
len ratingthree Unable to download gif from google chrome browser 
len ratingthree There are tons of blogs thread and discussion on user reporting and facing this issue on google com 
len ratingthree We are able to download the same gif via safari browser not sure if Apple is playing some tricks or chrome blocked this feature for iphone users 
len ratingone Nothing good to say
len ratingone I now have to have a passcode on my phone to use my saved passwords 
len ratingone I hate entering passwords which is why I save them in the first place so why would I also want to add a passcode to my phone if I already hate passwords 
len ratingone And how is this even a useful feature 
len ratingone Awesome browser but WHY CANT YOU DISABLE PULL TO REFRESH 
len ratingone Almost a dealbreaker for me here as I keep doing it accidentally and losing data spot on my page FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY or you will lose a user and many more
len ratingone The bookmarks button a button I use frequently has been replaced with the voice search button a button feature I don t use and don t intend on using and makes using this app a hassle Looking into other mobile browser options until this is fixed
len ratingone Chrome took a wrong turn 
len ratingone The stream lined menu that pops to the side of the screen and used screen real estate so efficiently is gone 
len ratingone Now when you open the book marks menu it half covers the screen instead of providing a nice long list of book marks to the side 
len ratingone Try and whip through the list and you risk the menu closing on you 
len ratingone Why Chrome 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone  Hey there thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone Feel free to submit this feedback directly to our development team 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone I used to love chrome on PC but it s a memory hog 
len ratingone This new update on iPhone makes it where anytime I go to see my tabs it randomly opens a tab 
len ratingone I have to click open tabs again and if I have a lot of tabs open I lose my place because it s always random and sometimes scroll through tabs to get to where I want 
len ratingone There s also a problem that happens in all sites from high mobile compatibility NYTimes and NPR to Wordpress blogging sites whenever I m scrolling down the site will randomly jump to the top 
len ratingone Sometimes I can t get past the first couple paragraphs I have to close the app and try again 
len ratingone Sometimes I just switch to safari 
len ratingone Lately I ve been using opera on PC 
len ratingone I switched to opera on iPhone I don t have to worry about random actions happening when I m trying to read an article 
len ratingone It was a good run Chrome 
len ratingone Take care 
len ratingtwo  So ever since I updated my IPad to I ve been having crashing problems 
len ratingtwo First the app crashes then when I try to get back in my IPad crashes 
len ratingtwo All iPad crashings have happened while I was using the app and so I think this app is in need of an update 
len ratingfour Sooo I have this issue that won t let me watch YouTube on my device and I m using google and using safari and it says try again later basicly if it doesn t work in the morning either it s a bug if not it s a bug that just is being weird but could you make sure this doesn t continue with the next update and I use so it may be an issue across devices or be a single type or a few but could you try and fix the bug please it is a little annoying 
len ratingfour Edit It has been minutes YouTube works again so uhhh also the crash bug could YOU FIX IT It is annoying my way to work around it is to copy and paste the links into notes and then copy paste again also it doesn t happen much with less tabs I think it s just ram thing with more than tabs I try to keep it like but sometimes I need a lot of research done so yeah but otherwise google your good you did good 
len ratingone Ever since I updated the app 
len ratingone When I go to a website to login it asks me to use a Passcode on my iPhone 
len ratingone I hate Passcodes 
len ratingone I used to prefer Google over Safari 
len ratingone But now I m just gonna have to use Safari 
len ratingone It s really laggy for my device I use a iPad mini it crashes sometimes please fix these bugs
len ratingone THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE IF YOU REQUEST A DESKTOP PAGE IT DOESN T GIVE YOU THE DESK TOP PAGE 
len ratingone FIX THIS
len ratingfive  I love it 
len ratingfive Amazing app I got a few ads but I love watching dantdm and mrbeast so I like this app and it works really well it doesn t black out and I don t have pop ups thank you for designing this app 
len ratingfive Bai 
len ratingfive Noice
len ratingfour Only thing needed is to add motion and orientation access in settings some how 
len ratingfour But I m sure that s apples fault 
len ratingone This app won t work on my iphone 
len ratingone It s updated I ve even deleted and reinstalled it cleared my history and cache and granted full permission but it won t allow me to do a video chat on a particular website
len ratingtwo When the app crashes all my tabs I was using disappear and I have to search for them again 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo Or I ll start using Safari because it s better
len ratingfive nice
len ratingfive BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA
len ratingfive You can watch porn
len ratingtwo The app crashes about once a week losing all of my tabs without warning 
len ratingtwo This has been going on for a couple months 
len ratingone Server closes randomly
len ratingtwo This app crashes all the time in the last months 
len ratingtwo  of the time I open the Google page type in a search and press go Only to be brought back to the Google page and my search query erased 
len ratingtwo Which I then have to type again 
len ratingtwo Once or twice OK of the time is too often 
len ratingtwo There s a bug in the app causing this behavior 
len ratingtwo Other times I have a number of tabs open and the browser will crash without giving me the restore pages feature upon reopening 
len ratingtwo If I didn t book mark those pages or save it to my reading list they re gone 
len ratingtwo Sometimes I get a phone call and I don t have time to do that before the crash 
len ratingtwo I wish Chrome worked a well as if used to 
len ratingtwo  Roy
len ratingtwo Takes up way too much phone storage due to chrome data 
len ratingtwo Literally took up GB on my phone because of saved cookies passwords and autofill results 
len ratingtwo Really annoying when it comes to downloading other apps besides itself 
len ratingtwo Not only that but randomly crashes when closing app causing chrome to display the Chrome didnt shutdown correctly message occasionally 
len ratingtwo Really annoying and not that good in my opinion 
len ratingone I ll use the browser for a bit and it locks up 
len ratingone So I close amp reopen it 
len ratingone It indicates that it closed unexpectedly amp prompts me to restore the tabs 
len ratingone I hadn t used it for a long time and remember that it has locked up through several versions 
len ratingone It continues to perform the same even after deleting amp reinstalling the app 
len ratingfive  I am 
len ratingfive Descent app not much glitches bye R I P
len ratingthree I definitely prefer chrome over safari but I currently use safari because I cannot stand how chrome does not default websites to the desktop version on an ipad
len ratingone  do not use this garbage
len ratingone Doest it work for ios 
len ratingtwo  Crashes too much and even crashes after trying to restore all closed tabs please fix 
len ratingfour The app is good an all but I wish it would allow you to have the same Google lens feature instead of having to do a shortcut through google assistant and as just a search app they should have this because it is a hassle to switch between those two apps 
len ratingfive I have nothing bad to say 
len ratingfive Not slow 
len ratingone Great browser if you want it to crash and lose all your tabs and give you no way of getting them back
len ratingone  Liberal and media information control and limitation 
len ratingone I m not too interested in a group that try s to control people through a control of information
len ratingfive Me gusta mucho relajar vacilar
len ratingone Keep losing all my tabs 
len ratingone And cannot restore 
len ratingone Annoying 
len ratingone  What is going on here sites appear way too zoomed in on IPhone Pro when compared with Safari 
len ratingone This browser has really gone down the drain huh 
len ratingone seems like af if these ad companies have paid google to not introduce a pop up blocker so that they can constantly bombard you with pop ups 
len ratingone can never use this browser very disappointing
len ratingfive This app is nice
len ratingfive We all know why we downloaded this
len ratingfive Google is great and all but can we please get a Google Forms app on IOS
len ratingfive  So in virtual school we have to open stuff on the internet and i dont have a computer so i had to use safari which took me way to long but on google it dont take long abd it saves my passwords
len ratingone  I used to love the chrome app and all but the new update had just made it along with google and safari very bad and I mean like painfully bad 
len ratingone One you can try to search deviantart a perfect social media art community and it will appear but it will act like it s gone for good 
len ratingone I try to search some of the sites I like to search but they don t even appear 
len ratingone It just acts like it doesn t even know the site and just asks if I wrote something incorrect 
len ratingone I wrote the thing correctly and it still says the same thing 
len ratingone Even on images and videos 
len ratingone I just want the old update back 
len ratingone The old one before this new and very annoying update that just came out 
len ratingone Chrome now requires your Apple device s passcode to use a saved password 
len ratingone Did they not think of why I saved the password in the first place 
len ratingone It s so I don t have to log in or times a day to access my school s Blackboard site 
len ratingone Now I have to type in my passcode AND be stopped before I sign into everything 
len ratingone This is an incredible inconvenience 
len ratingone Switching to Safari after this 
len ratingtwo I am using chrome on ipad 
len ratingtwo Great performance but two major issues 
len ratingtwo The list of open tabs if it too long the compound view with mini icons not really convenient 
len ratingtwo Cant disable cookie tracking 
len ratingtwo And it took gb 
len ratingtwo Of some saved data that you cant remove limit without deleting the app 
len ratingtwo Chrome is my browser of choice on my computers but after years of patience with this mobile version I am just about ready to throw in the towel and switch to Safari 
len ratingtwo I would really prefer to make Chrome work as I am very loyal to my google account and syncing history between devices 
len ratingtwo But the app constantly crashes and many pages are completely unreadable because of the constant refreshes and jumping around the page 
len ratingtwo It is extremely frustrating that the internal link browsers of some non browser apps pull up the same pages without the same troubles 
len ratingtwo If I hear word that the issues are resolved I ll gladly return but the internet should not be this unwieldy 
len ratingone  Besides the crashes the app it s using your information for advertisements gain 
len ratingone Do not use it
len ratingfive its great
len ratingthree Please fix the widgets 
len ratingthree They keep crashing all of a sudden 
len ratingthree  Chrome is overall the best web browser if your looking for a fast secure and personal internet app 
len ratingthree Even better that it includes The Google search engine 
len ratingone Your to freaking liberal 
len ratingfive  Ok so probably wondering why I love crome so much I will tell you so I play a game called Roblox it s actually pretty cool and I got logged out of my account and I had something called the login glitch that you can only fix with some apps so I was on YouTubeLooking for some ways to fix thisAnd I found out the only app that can fix this is Google Chrome and I think another way but I already had Google Chrome so yeah I did what the video said and to my surprise it worked 
len ratingfive You don t know how much this means to me Google Chrome is a very cool app and I think this helps a lot and I found out I wasn t allowed to do some things in Roblox anymore but I could still be a normal person I just couldn t say bad words but I don t care I got what I wanted back all thanks to the one and only Google Chrome 
len ratingone I ve had google home for a while and it worked great 
len ratingone Last September wemo stopped connecting 
len ratingone This august Nest Aware stopped working 
len ratingone Seems like Google isn t working 
len ratingone Smart home used to be very nice 
len ratingone Now it stinks 
len ratingone Paid too much for Smart home and now it s all dumb 
len ratingfive Uhm 
len ratingfive Tf 
len ratingfive Why is it 
len ratingthree Hola desde qu actualice ahora no me abre mi aplicativo del trabajo
len ratingone App crashes immediately upon opening 
len ratingone  iPhone 
len ratingthree This app constantly freezes on my iPad 
len ratingthree I find I m using Edge more reliably 
len ratingone  Esta app esta probocando problemas en mi iphone
len ratingone Chrome is letting companies track you across multiple websites when you use google chrome or any google product 
len ratingone Not sure what happened but the ability to type what you want to look for inside the search bar and on websites is disabled 
len ratingone The only option I see is for voice lookup which I don t want to use 
len ratingone This makes it impossible to use my phone for web browsing 
len ratingone Update this bug immediately or I ll be uninstalling the app permanently and using Safari 
len ratingfour Safari is a cool browser it is only made by apple
len ratingone I
len ratingthree Love Chrome 
len ratingthree Use it across the board 
len ratingthree But this app has the most ridiculous pull down to refresh and I ll find myself refreshing the entire page when I try to scroll back to the top erasing all my work 
len ratingthree Super frustrating that there isn t an option for a more tradition back refresh forward layout 
len ratingtwo Would be a nice addition 
len ratingone Chrome randomly deleted open tabs 
len ratingone Enough said 
len ratingtwo It require face id or phone passcode to use pre filled account info 
len ratingtwo I never approved of this 
len ratingtwo It did it on its own and i dont know how to fix it 
len ratingtwo Its unsafe pulling my mask down or typing in my whole code after i already did it just to look at my school grades or log into freaking target com 
len ratingtwo I want to turn this off but there is no way around it it seems like 
len ratingfive Hhshhxxh
len ratingtwo keep running into sites saying browser is out of date 
len ratingone  If I search for something the first pages of scrolling are all ads 
len ratingone I now hate Google 
len ratingone Google is to greedy and doesn t provide what I need 
len ratingone I won t purchase from companies that advertise through Google 
len ratingone  Unstable and Crushing every seconds on Re opening 
len ratingone Even when I just switch from Chrome to another Google Applications and go back to Chrome seconds later 
len ratingone Often Re opening After Crush of All Tabs is impossible as Re Open Tabs option vanishes and since end Chrome no longer allows to see Recently Closed Tabs and to Re Open All from there 
len ratingone Tons of useless script running non stop on every single tab and refreshing in flashing in front of the user making it impossible to read as the pages keep re setting zooming and repositioning the reader back to the top of the page on several sites 
len ratingone This unstable software release is becoming increasingly more infamous for Google 
len ratingone Sadly it feels they do not Test anything before their releases and just rush botched Releases to get paid for each Unstable Release instead of coming up with any good features and Testing them with their Beta Testers 
len ratingfive Once I can afford to Update to the New G Push my Needs to be a twelfth Edition to be Compatible to G and I Can t Afford to that Microsoft and the Gates Foundation with T mobile for the Fam la that can t afford all the Updates have practiced Humanitarian work with The White Rivet School District has been 
len ratingfour Unfortunately if your privacy is set to ages you can t google anything with a name in it such as Bella 
len ratingfour Even if you combine it with something like Bella the dog 
len ratingfour You should look into this 
len ratingone I recently discovered Google and Google chrome have their own built In tracking device or system and even if your not using your phone you are being tracked and Google freely shares all YOUR OUR information with the government 
len ratingone I have a son who works for Google and relays everything good and bad to me and over the years I have promised to never divulge anything he has told me for fear of loosing his job but this I feel is too important not to let out to all Americans who feel BIG BROTHER has gone too far 
len ratingfive hate it it keeps telling me to rate the app but i need it so stars 
len ratingfive Chrome is a good app for everything like I want to search for YouTube it will take me there like every browser app but I want like a thing that helps us protect our accounts so like chrome try s to protect out accounts so that we don t get hacked like I want to protect my account in case hackers wanna hack my account I want chrome to try to not let the hackers hack out accounts but this is a great browser app I just want chrome to try to not let the hackers hack our accounts like stop the hackers hacking our accounts and I want a button that says do not disturb so that hackers can t hack your accounts
len ratingfive Chrome is super easy and it accesses so much 
len ratingfive There are a few fixes needed but I can t put my finger on it 
len ratingthree PLEASE get rid of the feature where you slide the entire page to go to the previous page because I only ever use it on accident and it drives me nuts 
len ratingthree Or at least add a setting so I can turn it off 
len ratingfive Take of the hunch don t wanna die keep that pistol on my side
len ratingone What is this 
len ratingone  Trump 
len ratingtwo I wish I could uses the apps I have on my labtop that I need on my iPad
len ratingfour Can you have a apps section in the next update
len ratingone A once reliable browser has morphed into an unusable app that locks up constantly 
len ratingone When this bug first appeared a few months ago I assumed Google would address it quickly 
len ratingone No go 
len ratingone Weeks later the problem is unresolved making the browser virtually useless 
len ratingone Reloading the app fails to solve the issue 
len ratingone Sad that Google has so little concern for their once dominant browser 
len ratingone Bro when I try to search up something right it s says I have no WiFi my WiFi is fine but idk y it s not searching up I refreshed my phone and still nothing cmon now fix this bs honestly
len ratingfive Still chill Still chill Still chill
len ratingfour Would like to suggest a private function where you keep your really personal things hidden from payment for data and internet access usage 
len ratingfour Also make it hard to find personal information really private without permission 
len ratingone Searching is now super slow 
len ratingone For the last weeks 
len ratingone I ve been using Safari and Cake which load results instantly 
len ratingone WiFi or LTE doesn t matter for some reason searching is now slow 
len ratingone  YOUR APP IS THE STUPIDEST APP EVER 
len ratingtwo Been using for a long time and never had any problem but after the latest iOS updates the app is crashing and suddenly closing with all the tabs getting lost 
len ratingone Just stop selling private information to people
len ratingthree Overall this is a good app and I use it a lot but there s one major flaw that may even be a fatal one 
len ratingthree Please bring back the ability to always view the full URL in the address bar 
len ratingthree This is important information that shouldn t be hidden from users 
len ratingthree I ll try to find workarounds for now but if this functionality doesn t eventually get restored I ll probably just have to move to a different browser like Firefox 
len ratingthree Function over form you know 
len ratingtwo A once great browser has been brought down another notch by an astonishingly bad decision to hide the majority of the URL from the user 
len ratingtwo And unlike the desktop version there is no secret setting available to revert this awful change in behavior 
len ratingfive  Chrome can you make some updates that will fix the way when I click the select box it just makes a clone of history that happened the day before 
len ratingtwo Is taking forever to load up for the last two weeks or so 
len ratingtwo I ve tried using it with and without WiFi and still the same 
len ratingtwo If there some issues going on with chrome
len ratingfour I love how it s available on all platforms but i m having an issue when I switch tabs it just pulls me into another tab I have open and I don t even touch the screen if this could be fixed then I will full heartily give it a max star rating
len ratingfive  If you can change the background and You can get addons
len ratingone I Hate this piece ofApple it won t let me Sign in
len ratingthree I love chrome but it kinda slows down my apps it s a lot faster than google I can say that I really don t have anything else to say
len ratingone Every time I open up Chrome there s a pop up that shows and hides asking to make Chrome the default browser 
len ratingone It s super annoying and the reason I m uninstalling the app 
len ratingfive  Always come through
len ratingone  You are not able to zoom out of websites basic functionality
len ratingfive  Chrome on the computer version keeps duplicates history after you select all the history in the select box and it is very frustrating 
len ratingtwo Used to be Chrome on the iPad was good worked like on my laptop 
len ratingtwo I use it for my EMR 
len ratingtwo Now all of a sudden I log in and anytime I touch the screen to scroll to select a link to get a cursor in a text box to type etc 
len ratingtwo  there is a brief additional tab opened then it closes and I m back on my tab 
len ratingtwo However I can t get a cursor in order to type 
len ratingtwo Increases frustration and kills productivity 
len ratingtwo Just what I m looking for in an app 
len ratingone  whenever i open a new tab it completely jumps all the other tabs so if you want to go back and forth between pages its a hastle 
len ratingone the old version opened up a tab right next to the current one 
len ratingone now it freezes every seconds and it seems like they are doing nothing to fix any of this 
len ratingone its almost pointless to write a bad review at this point because everyone else already has yet they do nothing about it
len ratingone Crash is inevitable if you stay on a page for min 
len ratingone Such as chat and some video sites 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingone Quality has gone done so much 
len ratingone My main use case for Chrome on iOS is to translate pages using Google Translate but fairly often it doesn t seem to detect that the page is in another language 
len ratingone Unlike the desktop Chrome there is no way to force translation in this case 
len ratingone Some times I don t wanna be happy don t hold it against me if I m sad just leave me there lemme be sad OOOOOOOOOO 
len ratingthree  I love the app but the pop up blocker doesn t seem to be working at all very annoying please please please please please allow extensions for chrome for iOS that would help tremendously because I hate getting pop ups while searching
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive It helped me with all my internet problems 
len ratingfive Keep the good work up p 
len ratingfive Google Crome is such a good website 
len ratingone  I have to restart the app so many times because it keeps crashing 
len ratingone I m forced to recover my tabs every single time 
len ratingone I wanted to watch YouTube and it crashed in less than a second 
len ratingone Not recommended
len ratingone It s for kids with tablets man bad
len ratingthree For some reason it stopped giving me new articles like it used to i only have articles showing there for the past weeks and it doesn t matter how many times I refresh the articles remains but no new ones to be shown 
len ratingone Works on safari
len ratingone  I load websites I want to read later offline 
len ratingone Chrome will frequently crash my loaded sites and show a No internet connection error 
len ratingone Also steals data from the clipboard 
len ratingone  If I search for something the first pages of scrolling are all ads 
len ratingone I now hate Google 
len ratingone Google is to greedy and doesn t provide what I need 
len ratingone I won t purchase from companies that advertise through Google 
len ratingfive Sounds great
len ratingone  Lolz 
len ratingone Google took down my review 
len ratingone Here is what I said It s unstable 
len ratingone Crashes all 
len ratingone The 
len ratingone Time 
len ratingone They spy on you and sell your data 
len ratingone DDG and Firefox among others are better ways to go 
len ratingone I stand by what I said 
len ratingone Take it down again 
len ratingone  I love this app however as of it has reverted to what reminds me of before the last facelift of chrome from lots of corners and straight lines to rounded edges and search result boxes 
len ratingone This is ONLY on the ALL results the others like videos books news etc 
len ratingone results are in the most current looking version 
len ratingone This is also not in an update the last update for the app was weeks ago 
len ratingone I will update this review when this is fixed and change my rating to stars 
len ratingone Update as of Chrome is still in the outdated flat mode 
len ratingone I have updated my rating to star where before it was stars a whole stars because of the homepage 
len ratingone Like really Google what is wrong with you 
len ratingone You know that most people aren t going to come back and update their rating and review like I have been right and you are even advertising your app 
len ratingone Please read the feedback you are getting in the reviews it comes from the people that use your app 
len ratingone One though I am able to make it the default browser 
len ratingone  Constantly crashes freezes and deletes tabs 
len ratingone Lost count how many times it s crashed and when went to restore none of previous tabs were in the history 
len ratingfive This browser is the best among any other app browsers in the market
len ratingone Useless 
len ratingone With the new update the app crashes every time I open it 
len ratingone Use Firefox 
len ratingone I have been a dedicated Chrome user for years 
len ratingone I would not own an iPhone if I could not use chrome 
len ratingone Safari is a horrible platform and I have avoided sing it because of lags pop ups and tracking 
len ratingone While Google collects my fat as well there are ways to avoid the most annoying features 
len ratingone Ever since the iOS update Chrome is the worst ever 
len ratingone The program randomly shuts down during use and lately it stops loading pages and freezes while I m trying to scroll through web pages 
len ratingone Chrome needs an update or I m going to stop using it and move to Microsoft edge 
len ratingfive Hi this is cool
len ratingfive Best app ever
len ratingone So innaporte contant no more of this
len ratingfour Sometimes my browser just quits and closes out of all the tabs I had open and doesn t let me restore fast enough like it won t pop up to restore my tabs then as soon as I do a new search the restore button pops up and then goes away It s done this for a good while 
len ratingfour Even after new updates
len ratingone  Useless 
len ratingone Totally messed up the web based version of office 
len ratingthree It translate some pages perfectly while others still have foreign letterings untranslated 
len ratingfive I have been using chrome now and i constantly update it but everything that people are saying hasn t happened to me yet 
len ratingfive Idk i guess for every device its different 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is the best you get do you things that you cannot do on zoom
len ratingfive  Hi idio
len ratingone  I load websites I want to read later offline 
len ratingone Chrome will frequently crash my loaded sites and show a No internet connection error 
len ratingone And it hardly works anymore because so many pages now crash the browser 
len ratingone Google can t keep up with the ever changing demand of web pages 
len ratingone Not just for your sanity but for your security consider using another browser 
len ratingone Google is unfortunately no longer a trustworthy or quality company 
len ratingtwo The close all button is a very destructive action that is too easy to accidentally trigger 
len ratingtwo There should be a confirmation box asking if the user really meant to close all tabs or this button needs to be tucked into a menu so that it s only triggered by someone actually looking for the button 
len ratingtwo There are so many times my finger simply grazes the close all button and I lose all my tabs before I can make use of the undo action 
len ratingtwo This is very annoying 
len ratingfive  Cool
len ratingone Why did they make bookmarks hard to find and impossible to add now 
len ratingfive Please allow flash content without flash player on the browser 
len ratingone I am so fed up with this updated version of chrome with google 
len ratingone I keep losing the star icon for bookmarking websites 
len ratingone I have no idea where it went or how to get it back 
len ratingone I deleted the app and reloaded it and the star was visible 
len ratingone I was able to bookmark a few sites before it just went away again 
len ratingone Unsure what you did but somehow this update made Chrome unable to retrieve Google search results which like how do you break that You re Google lol
len ratingone  Sorry
len ratingone so it popped up saying oh i will get hacked in minutes not a good secure website
len ratingone What happened to the star to save bookmarks 
len ratingone Unbelievable
len ratingone All my searches suddenly included pro Biden websites while looking up toasters or air fryers 
len ratingone I was also no longer able to find political videos articles and so on unless they were pro Biden 
len ratingone Even though I might vote for the guy I wont put up with censorship and blocking medical backed research for protection whole they promote sites with diet tends with no research 
len ratingone Peace 
len ratingone Passwords won t update 
len ratingone Can t change the password manually it won t update new passwords anymore what s going on 
len ratingone Boring duh
len ratingone No longer saves gifs to Apple Photos 
len ratingone Just saves a still image 
len ratingone Worked prior to update 
len ratingfive what can i do without crome it has everything i need for work small businesss for free thank u google and chrome 
len ratingone Love google chrome but now it keeps crashing on my iPad
len ratingone Just get DuckDuckGo if you care at all about the things above 
len ratingone Other browsers are not as slick as chrome but at some point I think people need to care about what alphabet is doing to manipulate user searches and what they are doing with your info 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingfive Easily the most intuitive user friendly browser across all platforms
len ratingfour I love Chrome but hate that I have to use safari to save gifs in its original format 
len ratingfive  This is a great way to find what your looking for instead of searching other apps 
len ratingfive It s very helpful and I love it 
len ratingone Honestly I m a fan of google and their integration across all platforms but the overall presence of bugs and constant crashing is just upsetting 
len ratingone I am not mad at google for releasing such a garbage mobile app just disappointed 
len ratingfour Great app 
len ratingfour When I want to copy password from settings app confirmation page is off to the right too far to confirm
len ratingone My whole class uses it 
len ratingone And I m in rd grade 
len ratingone Teachers allow it 
len ratingone It should at least be 
len ratingfive Love chrome yass queen btw I m So back off haters
len ratingthree I ve been trying the past few days to search things on Google but every time I search something the page does not load 
len ratingthree I reloaded the app and it still doesn t work 
len ratingfive  its great
len ratingone This shows up as an ad when you search for Firefox 
len ratingone This is reprehensible 
len ratingthree Do you understand 
len ratingthree Carton 
len ratingthree The browsing page is also stuck 
len ratingthree When he previews multiple windows he will automatically click on the page in the upper left corner bug 
len ratingone For a google browser even on iPad it won t load the desktop version of facebook like safari does and it crashes my iPad when using Facebook through it 
len ratingone Also when I want to open maps in browser it force opens my Google maps app
len ratingone It was working great but now it s terrible with the new update please change it back 
len ratingone  I m tryna watch YouTube then this YouTube kids crap pops up
len ratingtwo  Chrome has been my go to browser for years but it s so incredibly buggy now it s unbearable 
len ratingtwo Gifs save as jpgs pages are jumpy the app reloads every page in the background so one loses their spot on the page with ads on pages the screen jumps up to the ads constantly instead of allowing the page to scroll down smoothly 
len ratingtwo AND incognito pages want to enforce cookies hello 
len ratingtwo Google used to be such an innovator 
len ratingtwo What happened to you guys 
len ratingtwo Stop the insanity 
len ratingthree How do I remove the history
len ratingfive  Love chrome Tass queen btw I m So back off haters
len ratingone The new chrome update crashes the app every time it s even opened 
len ratingone Didn t have this problem before the update 
len ratingone Plus whatever they changed with syncing caused every single one of my mobile bookmarks to disappear 
len ratingone Deleted and installed a number of times 
len ratingone The past several updates over the past several weeks have not corrected the problem 
len ratingone Next step is turn the sync feature off and see if that corrects the issue 
len ratingfour I really like this app 
len ratingfour I use it a lot but there s this one problem that I keep having that I would like to be fixed 
len ratingfour This happens once in a while but whenever I open a lot of tabs and I go to search something or open something the app crashes and loses all of my tabs 
len ratingfour If you could fix this issue please that would be great 
len ratingone I keep closing the app to find the same tabs open after i have closed them and the app closes all of my most recent tabs 
len ratingone Strange after the update
len ratingfive Honestly I love to research a bunch of stuff and using this app just makes it so much easier 
len ratingfive I love everything about this app 
len ratingfive I highly recommend it
len ratingone It Decided To Export My Calendar To Multiple Websites Allowing Them To Zend Me LOTS Of Stuff So I m Overloaded With Notifications But When I Deleted The App They Stopped It Took A While But They Stopped So I m Trying To Spare You Your Life To Stupid Notifications Like Amy Sent You Photos Every Day Times
len ratingone I prefer the Chrome browser to Safari but after switching for two weeks my cellular data is x that with Safari 
len ratingone Never going to use it again 
len ratingone  star for the sheer fact that it has been a year 
len ratingone two years 
len ratingone since you changed it and made it so you cannot easily switch between google accounts in the Chrome app 
len ratingone It used to be as simple as Settings Account select the account 
len ratingone Never had to log out and desync everything 
len ratingone It was easy simple 
len ratingone Bring this back please 
len ratingone Make it easy like on desktop 
len ratingtwo Chrome used to be my default browser on iOS until it stopped supporting Gif downloads at the end of August 
len ratingtwo Gifs downloaded with Chrome are now saved as jpegs 
len ratingtwo Like many others I ve been forced to switch to a competing browser 
len ratingtwo Until a few weeks ago I was able to bookmark a site by tapping on a star 
len ratingtwo Now it is missing and I cannot manage my bookmarks 
len ratingone Who the hell in your developers team thought it was a great idea to refresh our tabs without our permission 
len ratingone Also who the hell thought it was a great idea to remove the option of disabling such a frustrating feat 
len ratingone DO NOT RELOAD OUR TABS 
len ratingone I was writing a post in a forum that does not auto save the progress i hit another tab for reference seconds later i go back to the tab and my post progress is gone 
len ratingone STOP THAT 
len ratingone STOP MAKING DECISIONS FOR YOUR USERS 
len ratingfive It is awesome
len ratingthree Pages load but occasionally they can t be stopped or you can t go back to a previous page or sometimes the entire browser freezes up requiring a force quit 
len ratingthree Seems to be more very intrusive ads as well 
len ratingthree Previous version was smooth 
len ratingone DO NOT UPDATE
len ratingone When saving a gif from google images it saves as a still image instead of an animated gif 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive It works so well 
len ratingone Chrome used to be my go to browser even on my iPhone 
len ratingone Lately however any time I open any tabs on my app they are gone if I close out of the app 
len ratingone I can t even access them from history 
len ratingone It s so frustrating 
len ratingfour the app does it s job but sometimes at random when it loads a video imbedded in a site it will give an error other than its good
len ratingtwo What a hassle I constantly have to prove I m not a robot 
len ratingfive I ve been a Apple fanboy all the time but I did not I like so I disappointed I had safari all the time so I disabled safari see I was more like chrome fanboys then like safari fanboys I really likeeeeeeeeeeeeee chrome and so thanks 
len ratingone New update crashes every time you hit the google search bar
len ratingone I keep seeing ads on this so I thought it s good but I came after the update and it was trash idk if it was good before
len ratingone After this last update every time I open chrome it opens the same tabs I had open like weeks ago 
len ratingone So all the tabs I had open disappear and stuff that I was done looking at has reopened 
len ratingone Chrome no longer syncs with my desktop Chrome and I can t send tabs across devices 
len ratingone Fix this now please 
len ratingfour Mostly great 
len ratingfour New update won t connect to my chrome cast device from iPad but can see our smart tv 
len ratingfour Used to stream 
len ratingfour from the iPad to chromcast without a hassle 
len ratingone The app is good but the location of the close all tabs button ruins it 
len ratingfour Best browser for laptop and pc 
len ratingfour It would be also best for iPad if you add favorites bar 
len ratingfour Please 
len ratingtwo On iPad unable to switch b w accounts both are already signed in 
len ratingtwo Googled How to switch b w accounts on chrome on iPad and got results which weren t helpful 
len ratingtwo  unable to bookmark URL 
len ratingtwo Googled how to bookmark URL on chrome on iPad and the result instructions did not match with the actual contents of MENU option on the Chrome app 
len ratingtwo It has Bookmarks under Menu option but doesn t have star icon or Add to Bookmark or Bookmark option 
len ratingtwo I have noticed that these issues do not occur in MacBook 
len ratingtwo The usually dependable Chrome is providing a frustrating experience on iPad 
len ratingtwo Please fix this soon 
len ratingthree this is a good app but why does this app have gaming and other things 
len ratingthree If I had this app no more
len ratingfive This is trash but it s just a uu iiuuu is the way I can sssssdo ya tomorrow love you guys bye
len ratingone  The news updates are trash 
len ratingfive  Love watching so much porn on here
len ratingthree after using the more on my phone i notice when resuming chrome and at times coming back to it it will revert back to the st page of stack
len ratingone Very baddd
len ratingfive  dawn
len ratingfive I can search anything that I need when I need to 
len ratingfive This app is great BUY THIS APP 
len ratingone I installed Chrome for my son to use for school because so much of his activities utilize the Workspace 
len ratingone However because Chrome does not honor downtime I must delete this app as I have found that he is using his iPad beyond downtime configuration on Chrome which is affecting his sleep and productivity 
len ratingfour Great app however if you use a third party email app that s not gmail you re out in the cold 
len ratingfour I use outlook for everything and it would be nice if google and Microsoft could play well together and have outlook as an email option 
len ratingfive Great for getting two hairs in roblox
len ratingtwo Whatever update happened in the past few months won t allow an iPhone to save a gif from a Google search 
len ratingtwo It only saves a still image 
len ratingtwo Poor design on Google s part 
len ratingtwo I ll just go to Safari from now on 
len ratingtwo If anyone s curious you can still save a gif to your iPhone from Safari 
len ratingtwo Seems pretty lazy on Google s part 
len ratingtwo I love this app and use it for all my search stuff but since the new update I can t use the bottom main button to search since google made it a new tab button honestly it s really frustrating especially since I can t change it in settings anymore 
len ratingtwo Google should bring it back 
len ratingtwo Seriously considering a different search engine 
len ratingone Can t save gifs any more 
len ratingthree The new update has TRASHY appearances like what you would find in and it now is harder to navigate then hem desktop version
len ratingone  When you search for something the first pages are all ads and are not the best answers to what your looking for 
len ratingone Having to scroll down to determine what s your best answer vs returning what s just an ad is extremely annoying 
len ratingone You got too greedy Google 
len ratingone And now your browser is crap 
len ratingone I hate chrome because it won t let my get on anything
len ratingfive I like that
len ratingone I been using Google Chrome quite some time and I feel that nothing is free 
len ratingone Google does not charge anything from me to use Chrome yet it sells my privacy to highest bidder and then invade our privacy 
len ratingone Funny but fact is it has done over engineering for human tracking and Facebook has joined the race 
len ratingone Both companies are no good for anyone except themselves and I shall suggest that people should not use Google products anymore rather keep using default Apple products 
len ratingone At least Apple doesn t sell you the way Google does and respect your privacy 
len ratingfive I always end up going on google chrome on my computer and it s help full get 
len ratingone If one uses a browser with a bunch of tabs and then has the browser not shut down correctly or whatever but finds this out by not opening the browser directly but by tapping a link with a pop up then all those tabs CANNOT be restored unless one combs through their history 
len ratingone What a hassle Google 
len ratingone What a hassle 
len ratingtwo Every time I close down Google Chrome my tabs all get deleted 
len ratingtwo What the hell is with this 
len ratingtwo Fix this now
len ratingtwo EVEN WITH ALL THE UPDATES THE APP CRASHES OUT OF NOWHERE AND IT S NOT AS GOOD AS IT WAS BEFORE 
len ratingtwo THANK YOU GOOGLE YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN DESTROYING THIS APP AND MAKING IT UNUSABLE 
len ratingtwo THIS ISN T 
len ratingthree  Chrome closed on me forcefully and all my tabs were shut down and it doesn t let me opened them all up again it s just not worth while using chrome 
len ratingone iPad Pro cmon guys I m a google and chrome fan but what happened here 
len ratingfour If I search pug it let s me view D model of a pug so i searched shiba inu but guess what 
len ratingfour I can t view it in D 
len ratingfour Needs a shiba Inu or also known as doggo shibe shoob dogger shobe shober shoober or shiber
len ratingthree I would love to use chrome as a default browser but it s missing a very valuable plug in a AD BLOCKER 
len ratingthree You only that one little setting but that s not enough 
len ratingthree You need to partner with AdBlock Plus and AdBlocker to integrate their sets into the browser 
len ratingthree FIX THIS 
len ratingtwo I can t delete tabs I can t select tabs I can t do anything in the one feature I use about of the time 
len ratingfour I love this app but I still feel like there should be support for google chrome extensions just like the desktop version 
len ratingfour That would make things a lot easier 
len ratingfive I believe if someone is in a crisis situation as in someone hacked a phone and called att through my imei nobody took responsibility and google pixel a and also made purchases for google fi from Jan to August and i don t get it I had it for days because it would not dial out after so I switched services 
len ratingfive However you all sent me forms and case numbers many emails have been open and tied to my credit cards as in Best Buy and eBay etc and took over my google account bought a pixel book and google pixel s last year pink moon case 
len ratingfive And I have called all numbers and only number is maybe for google fi and order a product 
len ratingfive Anyway how do I get a rundown and orders like nest chrome cast stadia pixels etc they have that and assuring in some e iPhones in my name and info please email me back or get back with me cause these people are in the phone I m on through remote access control and have been through when I was hacked they changed number duplicated last one through SIM card maybe google needs to come up with another product like sim analyses and encrypt due to duplication so it doesn t just happen through a carrier 
len ratingfive I have may as I see and I do t know what to do who to ask my numbers were set as 
len ratingfive Method of verification and FTC and cyber crimes is who google store referred to with a link ZSimeone canceled my order out for a pixel book or slate and got them a pixel and used my card and then I was waiting to get the amount to help the situation if my info breached and security in device Apple tracked down all devices of there s to help me make a claim as I verify the product name and acct social ties to the device and assuring let me but they modify orders 
len ratingfive As far as I know they have canceled orders with companies online and ordered to them or canceled period 
len ratingfive Can you all hiuse me right direction my Gmail has different up and ohones register and I can t register this device and get applications 
len ratingfive Since mid July 
len ratingfive I believe y all should have a lot more support for email and offer encryption and some tech support and fraud and make people verify themselves before ordering more stuff and using other emails also filed income tax on e one and inn Hopi g you all can assist me 
len ratingfive Like I said it s been reported last week they were able to delete case number from y all out and chrome passwords and mind blowing it s across websites and password usernames and different emails please help me end all of this all my accounts financially compromised emails and they also started with Microsoft also 
len ratingfive Helpp thx Danielle thompson please help me retrieve and get this back to normal been a year or so 
len ratingfive I would appreciate much
len ratingone Before the latest update this app was usable 
len ratingone Now not even secs in you can t even search through the app before it freezes and shuts down the app 
len ratingone Just restore it back the way it was before the update 
len ratingthree BRUH I CANT I HAVE IT DOWNLOADED I CANT DO ANYTHINF WITH ROBLOX cause it SAYS DOWNLOAD CHROME CAN YIU HELP ME WIT DAT
len ratingtwo No default desktop browsing can t open google web apps its just a cripple safari experience 
len ratingtwo No real advantage not even with google own web apps 
len ratingtwo Confirm Form Resubmission The page that you are looking for used information that you entered 
len ratingtwo Returning to that page may cause any action you took to be repeated 
len ratingtwo Do you want to continue 
len ratingtwo  This is what is extremely annoying and completely unnecessary 
len ratingtwo This is also what is preventing me from using the back and forward buttons on pages of certain websites causing me to get stuck on web pages because this dumb message would pop up and disappear as soon as it appears making it to where I cannot do anything at all 
len ratingtwo To be completely honest I would rather use FireFox instead of this smoldering pile of trash anybody would call a web browser 
len ratingtwo At least that browser wouldn t do things like this preventing people from navigating between pages of certain websites 
len ratingtwo I honestly think that this browser has certainly reached a new low 
len ratingtwo It s weird that they have litary pic s of ppl and it s weird that they have things of ppl and it even shows we re they are
len ratingfour Loveeeee the Quality
len ratingtwo I m sure I m not the only one getting these adware phishing pop ups 
len ratingone Keeps crashing 
len ratingone I lost open windows lol Can t use it anymore 
len ratingtwo I have three iOS devices and chrome crashes on all three of them 
len ratingtwo The cache has been cleared I ve reinstalled uninstalled rebooted and nothing works 
len ratingtwo Google is not addressing this issue 
len ratingtwo Come on Google get it together and roll out a fix please 
len ratingtwo  ive been using chrome ever since i got my first phone ever its my go to and ill honestly always use it unless im forced to but the issue of chrome crashing and deleting all tabs is becoming more and more frequent and if im already mid way clicking something the restore option will go away leaving me with going through my history desperately trying to get it all back 
len ratingtwo this is happening was too often 
len ratingtwo literally almost every day and its tiring i want to use the app because its my favorite but at this rate it seems i might have to try and switch to a new one temporarily 
len ratingtwo i just hope this gets fixed instead of every update making it worse and worse
len ratingone I am using Chrome mostly but with latest few updates it simply stopped rendering any webpages 
len ratingone Randomly 
len ratingone  times out of it just gives me blank page for any url I type 
len ratingone Edge in opposite just works 
len ratingone Google lost its cool vibe 
len ratingone It just does not care anymore 
len ratingone Shame 
len ratingfive It s just the best
len ratingfive this app is amazing 
len ratingtwo lots of bugs crashes semi often and there s this really annoying glitch in particular that happens a lot where when you re trying to search on google and type out a whole long thing it literally just deletes it all and goes back to the main page without searching anything so you have to type it all again 
len ratingtwo not the biggest deal in the world but extremely annoying all the same 
len ratingtwo has been happening for a while and no update has fixed it so far 
len ratingone Chrome is junk 
len ratingone It s that simple 
len ratingone Worst browser out there 
len ratingone Where is the star icon so I can easily save pages to my favorites folders 
len ratingone Chrome has always been my go to browser for desktop and also iOS but since updating my iPhone to iOS it freezes up randomly 
len ratingone The only way to fix it is to close out the app and reopen your web pages 
len ratingone Super annoying and I hope they fix it soon or I ll be moving to another browser for iOS 
len ratingone Updating was a Mistake 
len ratingone Constantly freezing and having to restart Chrome 
len ratingone I ve had to start using another browser 
len ratingone Hopefully Google will fix it soon 
len ratingone Otherwise I ll jump ship permanently 
len ratingone If Chrome ever regains the ability to see the Full URL instead of a useless stub I will consider going back to it 
len ratingone As it is now it is just too aggravating to use 
len ratingthree I switched to cake browser because I like the interface a lot more and it s easier to use 
len ratingthree Chrome uses way too much ram in my opinion so I switched sorry chrome 
len ratingone PLEASE fix the crashing malfunction 
len ratingone SEVERAL times I may have like tabs open then randomly itll crash and delete them all 
len ratingone Not once has this happened with Safari on IOS 
len ratingone If this happens one more time before the end of the year I m not using Chrome on my IOS device ever again 
len ratingone This doesn t make sense that Google hasnt resolved this issue yet 
len ratingfour Get rid of the share button at the top and bring back the bookmark button 
len ratingfour Really annoying that that got removed with the last update 
len ratingfour  Hi Thanks for reaching out 
len ratingfour Try the steps to solve crashes issues in this Help Center article

len ratingone I tried to use a web site but it said I needed the latest update of google crome I was disappointed in it because you can t get any updates it has to stay the same way it is and I want this app to have an update
len ratingtwo Why is the button to close all tabs so easily tapped 
len ratingtwo Not even a confirmation 
len ratingtwo I ve accidentally closed and lost dozens of important open tabs 
len ratingone Constantly crashing ohh snaps 
len ratingfive Your app hasn t crashed for a hot minute now so came back to update my rating back to stars 
len ratingfive It used to crash every or so minutes so we ll see where it goes from here 
len ratingfive Anyways here s your gold star sticker 
len ratingfive Congrats Actually I lie 
len ratingfive Your app litterally traumatized me 
len ratingfive I m a tab hoarder or used to be until your app kept crashing on me and wiping all my tabs 
len ratingfive I slowly went through five stages of grief for all those lost tabs more then one hundred fifty three and counting 
len ratingfive and right as I came to accept defeat even downsizing form thirty to six tabs at a time you guys fix the stability issues 
len ratingfive Now whenever I approach your app with all the caution of someone approaching an armed robber I m torn with relief and anger when I see my tabs are still there 
len ratingfive The loading animation is terrifying because every time it boots up the app I expect an tab genocide 
len ratingfive I still don t know what to feel 
len ratingfive I think I need therapy 
len ratingone The latest release is completely unstable the worst I ve ever seen in a browser 
len ratingone It has problems It crashes It crashes It crashes Google needs to assign some professional programmers to this project who know how to create reliable software 
len ratingone We know that they have a few in the company they re clearly just not working on this project 
len ratingone As the titles suggests the app keeps crashing and if I try and re download lit it will not download 
len ratingfive Top notche
len ratingone It used to be in the menu but now it isn t
len ratingone Chrome is the only browser that periodically crashes with the message unexpected shutdown and offers to restore open tabs 
len ratingone However after several crashes Chrome no longer offers to restore open tabs and they are lost 
len ratingone Chrome is the only browser that doesn t have a reading mode like in Safari or Mozilla 
len ratingone Mobile chrome is a browser that doesn t have a dark theme for iOS 
len ratingone The Restore open tabs at startup function has not been working In Chrome on the desktop for a dozen updates 
len ratingone Google never responds to reviews and does not respond to requests from its users 
len ratingone The latest stupid bug that should never happen is forgetting the viewport size and making the content fit in of the screen 
len ratingone Completely leaves the right side blank and will not correct without a complete app kill 
len ratingone Google is trash 
len ratingone App just keeps freezing and crashing after a few seconds 
len ratingone Can t access saved webpages and logins passwords I need for work 
len ratingone AMP is the worst 
len ratingone You can t even send the link to a news article to a friend 
len ratingone It s just a hijacked google link 
len ratingone They ve over engineered a web browser haha 
len ratingone How is that even possible 
len ratingone It s not even easy to go to the real link 
len ratingone They trap you in AMP link with the UI 
len ratingone I would honestly give this zero stars if I could 
len ratingone This is classic business person wants make more money by keeping you on a google page and simultaneously ruined a good product 
len ratingone Please place the bookmark button back again next to the address bar like it was for years 
len ratingfive I
len ratingfour This is great app works across devices 
len ratingfour However when I turn my phone into landscape and back into portrait the screen shrinks itself instead of being to the edges 
len ratingtwo Using chrome in mobile is an incredibly inferior experience compared to just about every other browser 
len ratingtwo Because Google only blocks ads it wants to pages are slower to load have tons of garbage ads breaking up web pages or shifting them around as more ads load 
len ratingtwo Nobody should use this browser when Firefox Safari and the dang DuckDuckGo browser of all things offer something better 
len ratingfive My favorite 
len ratingfour current bugs that i ve run into w iOS google image search doesn t load past two images 
len ratingfour  gifs download as still jpgs 
len ratingfour  screen will randomly push to one side almost like it s in desktop mode but it s not 
len ratingfour toggling desktop mode doesn t fix it 
len ratingfour can t repro right now 
len ratingfour you have to close the tab and start over or just ride it out 
len ratingfour affects just a single tab 
len ratingfour other than that the browser is my go to on all platforms 
len ratingfour i love it 
len ratingfour i recommend it to everyone 
len ratingfour even recommend it on an enterprise level which i use daily as well 
len ratingfive  Your app hasn t crashed for a hot minute now so came back to update my rating back to stars 
len ratingfive It used to crash every or so minutes so we ll see where it goes from here 
len ratingfive Anyways here s your gold star sticker 
len ratingfive Congrats 
len ratingfive I use to use safari as my default web browser 
len ratingfive But it was just a hassle because the browser was just like a snail and It took a long time to load a webpage 
len ratingfive When I met google chrome everything has changed 
len ratingfive It is nothing like safari 
len ratingfive Like I said in the title it is just so fast 
len ratingfive Everything worked out perfectly 
len ratingfive Safari not so good 
len ratingfive Google chrome great 
len ratingfour It s pretty good at what it does 
len ratingfour it s better then other Google apps but there some time when it just says imma head out and everything breaks But other then that it s not bad
len ratingfive I m gonna play chrome dinosaur every time D
len ratingthree Not sure if it s the newest chrome update or my phone has downloaded something or the webpage I m on 
len ratingthree But chrome keeps compressing squeezing itself into the screen 
len ratingthree Keep having to refresh the window
len ratingone What is going on 
len ratingone Come on Google o I used to use you as my main source 
len ratingone Why does my pop up blocker keep coming on 
len ratingone It s annoying as I m forced to us because our work platform and sales force records are required to sign in 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS 
len ratingone Talking about Chrome it is an app where you are looking for informations you need to know or there are alot of things you can do in Chrome like doing translations or copying images and etc 
len ratingone BUT 
len ratingone I have finally found some problems when I am using this app 
len ratingone Sometimes I go to Google Translate to translate an English word to other languages 
len ratingone But whenever I tap on a button where you have to select any languages OR whenever I am tapping on one of the languages I m choosing for this suddenly happen 
len ratingone I got moved to a previous website or any different website that what I don t need to visit or even using it 
len ratingone Even though I didn t went there by searching it on the search bar 
len ratingone It teleports me there when I translate the English word 
len ratingone The blue loading bar is very annoying 
len ratingone Like when I go to a website where I had stopped at the bar is appearing and loading but it suddenly stops on one place where it is on 
len ratingone Do I have to wait several minutes for it to continue moving until it finally reaches to the end 
len ratingone I hate it when I go to the search bar on the and typing something on the search bar juat to see something I wanted to see 
len ratingone There are no results there was supposed to be 
len ratingone Like when I searched Mongol Empire on the search bar the search results will not pop up thinking that the empire dosen t actually exists long time ago 
len ratingone That s all but can you fix Google Translate 
len ratingone Like when I translate an English word into different languages the result will be the same like the word is same as the English langauge if you don t understand Like this I translated the word panda to Greek language 
len ratingone But it will stays on English but not Greek like it was supposed to say panta but not the English version which is panda 
len ratingone I hops you understand this but don t ignore or don t stop reading without continuing it again 
len ratingone Thanks Chrome 
len ratingtwo  There s need to be a fix cause this browser ain t playing nice with iOS 
len ratingtwo Keeps crashing
len ratingone It s literally not just as good as any other internet app if you download this one ya just don t care about privacy 
len ratingone To each his own 
len ratingone Trying to scroll on any website causes the app to hang and then crash and it asks me to restore my pages 
len ratingone  star until fixed 
len ratingone Chrome is great it loads fast and it s not complicated to use but wait just one precaution it decides to delete all of my tabs when I decided to update the app 
len ratingone I try going to recently closed tabs and I got out of the tabs I lost back 
len ratingone Thanks google 
len ratingone It was working so well for a while 
len ratingone Now the page randomly shifts to the left 
len ratingone Freezes after about seconds every time it s opened so completely unusable 
len ratingone I ve in reinstalled adjusted settings etc nothing makes it better so have started using Firefox until Chrome gets their act together 
len ratingone Whenever sometimes I clicked on p not sure why p is not there it brings me back to the previous page 
len ratingone Also the app use so much battery life 
len ratingone There is no handoff for YouTube it should be whenever I stop at for example then I go back should be at not about seconds before or go back to the beginning of the video 
len ratingone At this point might as well use Safari because they are better at YouTube which should be Google is better which they are not 
len ratingone I d just like to read watch some stuff thanks 
len ratingthree Its google chrome so obviously I m used to using it as my default 
len ratingthree The interface is friendly easy the bookmarks are wonderful the quick access buttons are very helpful everything works My only complaint is that recently the bookmarks icon the little star up top right keeps disappearing 
len ratingthree I have to delete chrome then reinstall to fix it only for the star to disappear again 
len ratingthree I m not doing anything to cause this and I cant find a way to bring it back 
len ratingthree Not a big problem but still quite annoying 
len ratingthree Can someone plz help me figure this out 
len ratingthree  To clarify my actual bookmarks are fine 
len ratingthree It s only the star icon that goes away 
len ratingone Need to fix when I rotate my phone and back the website is screwed up appears zoomed out or something 
len ratingone Makes this browser unusable right now 
len ratingone Back to crap safari or now using Brave browser for the time being 
len ratingone Many people aren t aware of this but the mainstream media Facebook Google and many other organizations censor information they deem inaccurate 
len ratingone Social media is the platform we use to express our opinions 
len ratingone The first amendment ensures every American the right to say what they want whether true or untrue 
len ratingone We have the right to decide for ourselves what we believe 
len ratingone This is one of the many things that makes America the best country in the world 
len ratingone How thoughtful of corporations to filter the inaccurate information for us 
len ratingone I had a collection of open tabs that was accumulated over several years and it was just wiped out by a Chrome crash 
len ratingone I checked the Recent Tabs menu but there was nothing listed for my iPad 
len ratingone So many resources lost 
len ratingone Multiple websites have had issues with unwanted cropping and zooming when being responsive to my mobile device 
len ratingthree The overall Chrome experience is fine but the latest update brought in a significant flaw 
len ratingthree When visiting a mobile native site if you flip to landscape then flip back to vertical the website shrinks to fill up less of the window 
len ratingthree Around of the page is white space 
len ratingthree Reloading the website or closing out of the app and going back in does not reset 
len ratingthree You have to go to a different website and then go to the previous website to though the address bar not via the back button 
len ratingthree This error is extremely frustrating when reading a long article or browsing on a forum and near the bottom of the page 
len ratingtwo Why the hell did Google move the bookmark buttons to be within share without mentioning this in any version update 
len ratingtwo Is there a password limit in chrome 
len ratingtwo not saving all passwords constantly have to reset 
len ratingone Fix the bugs that keep making the screen freeze and unusable
len ratingone  Chrome used to work beautifully on my iPhone but now half of the links I open don t work or they open formatted all wrong 
len ratingone It all happened after the latest iOS update so I have a hunch this is an Apple issue and not a Google issue but please fix it either way 
len ratingone When I m using Google Chrome for iOS on my iPhone if I tilt the screen from portrait to landscape and back to portrait the app shows margins on both sides that shrink any webpage I m using 
len ratingone Then scrolling down causes the margin on the left to shift to the right making the webpage offset to the left 
len ratingone Refreshing the page by swiping up does not fix the issue but refreshing by clicking the URL then return will fix the issue temporarily 
len ratingone  Just moved from Android why on earth can this browser just not WORK 
len ratingone I constantly get weird visual glitches where the page I am looking at gets shifted to the side or I am not able to click anything 
len ratingone How long had this app been out and it still is this glitchy 
len ratingone Cuts off top of page 
len ratingone Have to use safari from now on 
len ratingfive I like chrome is a cool app and I love that chrome has a lot off thing I loved 
len ratingfive And I love that Chrome is the one that I can not say that is not the best 
len ratingfive I thing is the best app ever so I love is the best cool and is really fun 
len ratingfour I like google chrome and use it on my computer and would love to use it on my iPad Pro but I am stuck using safari for one reason there s no way to permanently change it from mobile view to desktop view and that s just not good enough for me 
len ratingfour So I will be sticking with safari until they make that change 
len ratingfour Please make it possible Google 
len ratingone Since this update or the last gifs won t save 
len ratingone Just stills of gifs 
len ratingone Pretty lame bug 
len ratingtwo There is something about this app since it updated that is running slow particularly when trying to load web pages that typically load fast 
len ratingtwo If I quit the app and reopen it runs fine for a bit then begins to loads pages extremely slow again 
len ratingone Ever since upgrading to iOS now my chrome browser has bars on both Sides of the content on a page making the page smaller 
len ratingone Is this going to be corrected 
len ratingone Since the last update it has been constantly crashing when scrolling through webpages and opening a new tab freezes the app 
len ratingone I have to constantly close the app and reopen the app 
len ratingone It s extremely frustrating right now 
len ratingone Might wait until there is a fix for this on iOS 
len ratingone Why was the bookmark button removed in the latest update 
len ratingone I don t want the url bar to have Vice search 
len ratingone Can we have an option to use the bookmark button instead
len ratingfour Web page zoom is broken when you zoom out or sometimes click on links inside websites on Chrome for iOS it is often zoomed so far out mobile web pages don t fit to screen resolution and the web page is zoomed to far out 
len ratingone Every three seconds the You are signed in pop up shows and I cannot get it to stop 
len ratingone Things are laggy with the new ios as well but the pop up is worse 
len ratingone Why is there not a don t remind me again check box for this message 
len ratingone It s annoying and useless after seeing it once 
len ratingone I ll be using firefox for now and forever if this doesn t get fixed 
len ratingthree  I love this app however as of it has reverted to what reminds me of before the last facelift of chrome from lots of corners and straight lines to rounded edges and search result boxes 
len ratingthree This is ONLY on the ALL results the others like videos books news etc 
len ratingthree results are in the most current looking version 
len ratingthree This is also not in an update the last update for the app was weeks ago 
len ratingthree I will update this review when this is fixed and change my rating to stars 
len ratingtwo Zooms in too far so you can t click everything on a site on the sides 
len ratingtwo Doesn t even work if you request desktop site 
len ratingthree I liked Chrome on laptop but on iPhone it hangs and crashed too often
len ratingfour The text in required HTML input tags isn t aligned properly When linked to any webpage the top px are cut off until the user clicks the address bar and then away iPhone X iOS 
len ratingone Latest version has removed favorite star from address bar 
len ratingone No idea how to save a bookmark now
len ratingthree If you make the mistake of going from landscape to portrait page no longer loads properly 
len ratingthree Only happened after recent app update
len ratingfour Since the recent iOS update that allows you to change the default browser I installed Chrome first since it s the one I mainly use on my desktop 
len ratingfour Nice clean and minimalist UI with syncing and sending a webpage to the desktop all key features that work well 
len ratingfour But it lacks the immediate convenience of pinning your favorite sites to the home page unlike Firefox and Edge which have that option 
len ratingtwo First off I am biased in favor of Google products especially chrome 
len ratingtwo Long live the king 
len ratingtwo This being said what the crap happened recently with the update 
len ratingtwo The margins are now offset and I have to scroll left and right for most websites in addition to up and down 
len ratingtwo It might have something to do with the iPhone s top notch as the website does not load information beyond the right notch 
len ratingtwo It is extremely frustrating and annoying the text is too small to see and I am legitimately considering using Safari 
len ratingtwo Please don t make me use Safari 
len ratingfour  It s a good web browser but unreliable when it comes to passwords and autofill 
len ratingfour It can get frustrating 
len ratingfour  I m dead so ima just give this stars uh anyway chrome is cool BUT DONT FALL FOR MALWARE SCAMS DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE KIDS
len ratingone  HONEY SAID I WILL GIV HIGH FACE AND MEH MOM SMAK MEH IN FACE BECAUSE HIGH FACE 
len ratingone CHANG RIGHT NOW YOUNG LADY gt PHAT
len ratingfive It s all when I search webs it s cool but it s like windows too 
len ratingone Recently the star icon used to bookmark a page has disappeared from the toolbar at the top of the browser UI 
len ratingone I haven t found any way to bookmark a page 
len ratingone If I reinstall Chrome the star icon shows up on first using Chrome but disappears the next time I open it 
len ratingone I m using an iPad Pro inch nd generation with the latest OS version 
len ratingone  freeleafy
len ratingone Safari is soooooo better 
len ratingone This is a recent problem and I hope it gets fixed soon
len ratingtwo so confusing now 
len ratingtwo Way too much going on when you open the app 
len ratingtwo Not loving it at all 
len ratingone  Horrible 
len ratingone No free speech allowed 
len ratingone These past few days the app has been crashing like crazy
len ratingfive  J aime Google chrome
len ratingone Please fix this as its no longer accessible due to the constant crashing amp losing every window you had open 
len ratingone Cant open documents as it gives you an error message everytime asking you to send the error report for support 
len ratingone Fix the bugs ASAP 
len ratingone Very bad
len ratingone at first Chrome was working until this month every time i try to enter it just kicks me out please fix this 
len ratingfive This is number one and zero flaws
len ratingone When watching videos I could expand the entire size of the screen now it won t 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingone I ll do something with my history like delete it 
len ratingone tap one of my histories 
len ratingone But then it ll undo and go back to what I was doing 
len ratingone Thanks a lot chrome for ruining my work 
len ratingone This used to be a great app but over the last few weeks it s gone to hell 
len ratingone Some pages shrink and dock themselves to one side of the screen other pages won t scroll 
len ratingone I m constantly having to completely close the app and restart it 
len ratingfive So I think that it s really good and usable 
len ratingfive But one thing that was kind of annoying is that whenever you change your photo for your account it doesn t stay there and it removes it 
len ratingfive But other than that it s actually a really good app 
len ratingfive and like I have to say again it s very usable And you can see YouTube on it 
len ratingfive And I really prefer it for some people who get bored a lot 
len ratingfive It s a really good app 
len ratingone It s currently crashing everytime j reopen the app having to restore tabs
len ratingfive The problem is that I can t download the app and I saw some cool stuff on it and I want to play around with it so how do I download it o 
len ratingtwo When I open a New Tab on the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard mouse the search bar is not auto selected 
len ratingtwo I have to click the mouse and select it which is really bad UX 
len ratingtwo Please improve this basic UX issue 
len ratingtwo Also add my desktop version bookmarks bar under the address bar 
len ratingtwo Otherwise a good browser 
len ratingone Hi developers I have read your customers reviews and some of your customers use google chrome to watch porn and you guys should know that porn is illegal to watch 
len ratingthree Windows don t open correctly nor are they sized properly you can t scroll really bad update 
len ratingone  The sides show up and the scaffolding is terrible 
len ratingone Apple and google the two highest paid companies in the world yet the one staple app is complete garbage 
len ratingone Search doesn t work entering search term hitting go but field resets and nothing happens
len ratingtwo The update to support iOS is good but Chrome is still lacking Needs an Ad blocker Needs a widget
len ratingone Fix this please when I switch between the two it only fills the screen up halfway 
len ratingone I really don t want to use safari as I been using chrome since it came out 
len ratingone After the new update Chrome google map have started crash check it out please 
len ratingone Super uncomfortable when I was driving 
len ratingone It never happened before 
len ratingone What s going on 
len ratingone This started around weeks or so it began with chrome not letting me have more than tabs open and if I closed a tab it would reopen it 
len ratingone So I restarted my chrome and now it won t leave a tab open at all 
len ratingone If I close the app then all the tabs are gone 
len ratingone It s very frustrating as I use chrome daily and it s such a hassle having to go through history to find the tabs that were closed 
len ratingone This has never happened to me and I just can t find a way to solve it it s really disappointing 
len ratingfive We only have it downloaded for porn
len ratingone Whenever the app crashes it completely clears all open windows and doesn t prompt or have a way to reopen what was lost 
len ratingone History search doesn t help 
len ratingone Safari or Brave does not have this issue 
len ratingone Bad CX 
len ratingthree When I save gifs it doesn t work
len ratingone I have no desire for this application but I am forced to download it as the links in emails will no longer open in Safari from Google s Gmail application 
len ratingone This is crap 
len ratingone And I refuse to use it for anything other than what I am forced to use it for 
len ratingone It has been moved to the hidden application section in ios 
len ratingone Don t use google it use your data to make profit
len ratingfive If your nineteen you can watch porn things
len ratingfive I downloaded this to play the Dino game whenever I want to git what I wanted 
len ratingfive  would recommend
len ratingone It s really bad extremely buggy 
len ratingone I feel like chrome developer team consist of college students who just learned how to code 
len ratingone Switching back to safari 
len ratingfive Let see
len ratingfive Get this if anything
len ratingtwo  Doom stinks quake is a better game 
len ratingone In chrome there is mostly viruses in websites THAT THEY DIDNT REMOVE its been a problom for a long time
len ratingthree Usually a good app but recently if you swap between horizontal view and vertical its zooms out and shrinks my screen 
len ratingthree I ve used this app for quite awhile but what prevents me from switching over from safari all the way is that there isn t a bookmarks bar at the top of the browser 
len ratingthree I feel like that should be intuitive because you can do that on Mac pc 
len ratingtwo Chrome used to be superior to other browsers but now it s barely functional 
len ratingtwo Google has become a worse software developer than Microsoft which is a feat 
len ratingtwo This app is a sloppy resource hog that does almost nothing right anymore 
len ratingtwo More than half way through and nearly every major iOS app in the universe has dark mode except chrome 
len ratingone Extremely buggy now 
len ratingone Don t know what happened 
len ratingone Websites only load partially or fails to scroll 
len ratingone Apps run with overlapping copy Unusable on my iPad mini
len ratingthree I need to get dark mode in this app like when I reed article in Google chrome on android phone 
len ratingthree when I search chrome flags and put dark I get nothing and I still I don t know why 
len ratingthree I close the app for the day and it s been three days since Chrome suddenly closes all my tabs when I didn t press that option 
len ratingthree And I can t UNDO it 
len ratingthree FIX IT 
len ratingone All the photos I try to save come out as still images 
len ratingone That is so strange 
len ratingtwo It is nice to know I am not the only one that lost the top couple of lines within the last weeks 
len ratingtwo I can see if I pull down but then slides back under address bar 
len ratingtwo It makes those pages unusable ie all my college reading 
len ratingtwo Back to Safari it still works 
len ratingone Won t fill in saved passwords won t download resources and has problems downloading PDFs 
len ratingone Useless for anything but browsing
len ratingtwo  I used to love my Chrome app 
len ratingtwo I bragged about it to everyone I know 
len ratingtwo After the bugs over the past couple weeks though I m heading back to safari 
len ratingtwo Web pages freeze 
len ratingtwo If I turn my phone sideways and then vertical again the screen is zoomed out and everything is tiny 
len ratingtwo Nothing fixes it except closing the tab 
len ratingtwo Half the time when I leave the app even for seconds to check a text it restarts and deletes all the web pages I had open 
len ratingtwo If you head over to read the Google Maps reviews people are saying pretty much the same thing 
len ratingtwo Ever since the update a couple weeks ago google is broken 
len ratingtwo What the heck 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone It s awful nothing about it is good it makes my phone over heat I don t have a really bad phone too I have the newest iPhone 
len ratingone It kicks me out every mins 
len ratingone I hate it
len ratingtwo New version keeps crashing 
len ratingtwo No problems before 
len ratingtwo Ugh annoying 
len ratingone I am not able to use this app for longer than about seconds before it freezes completely 
len ratingone I have used this app on two different phones and I ve had the same problems every time I use it 
len ratingone I would look into a different web browser if I were you 
len ratingone Don t waist your time 
len ratingone I m normally a big fan of google but not this app 
len ratingone Hi Landscape view has a problem after new update 
len ratingone please solve this important problem 
len ratingone Even with the latest update after a few seconds of use Chome just locks up 
len ratingone Upon restart it asks if I want to restore pages 
len ratingone This only started happening recently but it is happening on multiple iOS devices 
len ratingone As it stands Chrome is no longer usable 
len ratingone I ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing works it keeps crashing please fix 
len ratingone It s way too smart that it pisses me off
len ratingone  Pretty much unusable on my iPhone SE 
len ratingone Shortly after loading any page it completely freezes and has to be force closed 
len ratingone Tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail 
len ratingfive Tuffbrood
len ratingone Whenever I am trying to look up something specific googles results have literally nothing to do with the subject I looked up 
len ratingone I fell that there should be some major changes to googles algorithm as using it is as easy as walking up to random people in a while other country who speak a different language than you that you don t understand and asking them something you need to know 
len ratingone It is a useless app and it is very frustrating to work with I really hope you make it less of a garbage shoot 
len ratingthree Chrome not sure what went wrong

len ratingfive But lately chrome crashes on my ipad literally every minute 
len ratingfour I m having issues on chrome while reading books on loan from my library 
len ratingfour The issue started about two weeks ago 
len ratingfour I cannot read the top two or three lines on the page 
len ratingfour Refreshing the page or turning it sideways and back do not resolve the issue 
len ratingfour Changing don t size doesn t matter 
len ratingfour Neither does rebooting the tablet 
len ratingfour I m having the same problem on all three of our family tablets 
len ratingfour I ve gone to reading my books in other browsers 
len ratingfive Did not want to get a second browser 
len ratingfive Had to get this because Amazon is broken on Safari and neither Apple or Amazon offered any advice 
len ratingfive Works with Chrome so clearly Apple is at fault 
len ratingfive Fix your product Apple 
len ratingone None of the browsers including Chrome are very good 
len ratingone They are nothing like browsers on computers 
len ratingone Very little has been done to improve the user experience 
len ratingone Incognito mode isn t black anymore 
len ratingone New update didnt fix the problem app crash after minutes of browsing come on 
len ratingone Do it right i hate using safari
len ratingtwo It s impossible to get your chrome bookmarks on iPad 
len ratingtwo I don t understand why this ruins the user experience with my iPad
len ratingone  Ever since the most recent update Chrome zooms out of pages so they only fill about of the screen and it s really annoying 
len ratingone Until it s fixed this definitely makes it a star app as it s really annoying 
len ratingtwo In version Gmail doesn t work properly menus are not visible 
len ratingone It used to be great but over the past few months it s started to freeze up and crash 
len ratingone It seems to have become very buggy

len ratingone Not the most current hardware but hardly obsolete 
len ratingone  Latest update keeps locking up and I have to force close the app 
len ratingone When I open it back up it says it has crashed and wants to restore my tabs

len ratingone Chrome used to have an easy feature to go into desktop mode from my phone and be able to an advance image search and search for images that have a MP resolution or higher in one of the most recent updates that feature broke so now when I go into desktop mode from my phone it shows it as if it was mixed with the mobile version and it seems broken which is very frustrating 
len ratingone Please fix it because whenever I m trying to search for high quality images it just doesn t work anymore
len ratingfive  You all watch porn
len ratingone For the last few days my open tabs completely disappear when I leave the app

len ratingone I almost never get websites to take up the full screen other than the initial load really annoying bug that no one seems to have the solution for 
len ratingone Probably am ios bug to be honest since chrome doesn t have this issue on any of the other platforms it exists on
len ratingone Latest unnecessary update has cut the top of every web page off

len ratingfour  Chrome is very nearly there on iOS but it s missing one huge feature that s kept me on safari this long a download manager 
len ratingfour With iOS safari added real download support to the phone s file system and as someone who downloads a lot of video files this has been immeasurably helpful 
len ratingfour When trying to download video on Chrome however I simply get the classic iOS full screen video player 
len ratingfour Once iOS hits and Chrome can be my default browser I wanna jump in 
len ratingfour I just can t without a download manager though 
len ratingfour It s been a year now guys please help us out 
len ratingfive Archivar
len ratingthree Please fix landscape mode 
len ratingone Address bar blocks the top of every website which makes navigating certain websites impossible 
len ratingone Also can t suggest passwords like the desktop and Android version can 
len ratingone I never like to update apps or phones for that matter and I had to update my iPhone to get an app I needed which I couldn t find in the App Store whole still on iOS version 
len ratingone So I finally updated my iPhone to iOS version 
len ratingone I hate the new version but I m slowly adjusting 
len ratingone One of the side affect is goggle chrome app has been crashing every time I go on it or I want to print something or purchase something 
len ratingone I should have researched but I figured I should update since I updated my iOS and to my surprise it s totally different and I hate it 
len ratingone I have it on my iTab ans I never use it for searches it s so cumbersome and fragmented 
len ratingone There should be a way to downgrade but apparently not on iOS 
len ratingone  No longer saves gifs to Apple Photos 
len ratingone Just saves a still image 
len ratingone Worked prior to update 
len ratingtwo Chrome used to be my go to browser on my phone but over the last year or so I find more and more websites that don t work in Chrome but work just fine in Safari 
len ratingtwo No longer recommended 
len ratingone I play a game in desktop mode and after the most recent update it looks very different 
len ratingone When I switch from landscape to portrait orientation the screen dimensions change so it is very skinny and tall 
len ratingone Using only of the screen width 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive I don t do many reviews for apps in this store but Google chrome is amazing especially for storing data on your phone and computer makes it so much easier this version is great I had this issue yesterday I literally thought of suggesting to allow to use my chrome passwords the only thing at the time was downloading all your passwords in PDF form now Apple and google has made it so you can select auto fill passwords chrome now is one of them 
len ratingfive So I have my Apple and chrome all in one place 
len ratingfive Maybe you saw me have the issue lol 
len ratingfive Thanks for one of the best browsers and now more simple to use our stored private data 
len ratingone As far as search engines go it s does it s job well but it crashes to often for my liking and deletes all the pages I was on with it 
len ratingone Bring back custom range for search
len ratingone Who is John Galt 
len ratingone The guy who revolted against a world pushing their view onto him 
len ratingtwo  Needs better update this made it slower than before
len ratingtwo Up until recently I haven t had any issues with Chrome 
len ratingtwo Now whenever I go to a news website and try to scroll down for example the screen goes blank and turns to gray 
len ratingtwo I cannot do anything once it crashes and goes blank 
len ratingtwo I have to either refresh the page or close it and try again 
len ratingtwo Having the same issue with my laptop whenever I watch a video and make it go full screen 
len ratingtwo I hope this gets fixed soon so I can browse the Internet like a normal person again 
len ratingfive googel 
len ratingfive chrome need a add download manager in chrome like new safari version add this 
len ratingfive change icon to dark mode
len ratingone This thing has no blocking capabilities and no dark mode not even in the flags settings 
len ratingone It does not allow for add ons either It is like we re back at the last millennium
len ratingfive I had chrome because I needed it for school it is genius and I love it it has all you need Youtube Webs a lot of things I love It is even better than Safari because it is faster and better 
len ratingone It s a recent issue that I ve seen many people complaining about but mobile Chrome has completely lost the ability to save images and more worryingly copy and paste text 
len ratingone This doesn t seem to be solely a Chrome issue either it s across the board for Google apps as no one can seem to CP from their Drive apps either 
len ratingone Chrome has also decided that it needs to close ALL MY TABS every time I minimize the app which is OBVIOUSLY INFURIATING 
len ratingone I recommend the developers do something about these issues posthaste because Safari is garbage but it s looking better with every passing minute 
len ratingone Use Chrome on all my Windows Mac Linux OS computers and once logged in I have all my bookmarks on top of the browser and don t need to remember passwords or type addresses and login credentials 
len ratingone Now the Chrome Ipad app has no way to do that 
len ratingone Cant load my bookmarks and have it on the top bar the way all my bookmarks are saved in the order I want to have them available across different OS devices 
len ratingone Google Chrome developers really 
len ratingone Is this so hard to do 
len ratingone bookmarks sync 
len ratingone Step up your game or Apple Safari will win this one
len ratingone My cookies are NOT OFF 
len ratingone However site settings say to turn on cookies 
len ratingone THERE ISN T EVEN AN OPTION TO TURN ON COOKIES B C CHROME HAS THEM ON 
len ratingone  All of a sudden the app will not work with cell data on and it says not data connection
len ratingthree Love chrome and have been using instead of safari for many years on every device 
len ratingthree But for the past few weeks autofill hasn t been working for my credit card 
len ratingthree It is very annoying if you don t have your wallet on you 
len ratingthree Then I have to switch all the details to safari to do the purchase 
len ratingthree This can take a while depending on what it was i e 
len ratingthree long grocery list 
len ratingthree I am signed into my account and everything is checked that should be 
len ratingthree Still no CC autofill 
len ratingthree Password works sometimes but for many websites it doesn t show up for some reason either 
len ratingone No se qu pasa intento abrir algunas p ginas como por ejemplo whatsapp web para poder ver otra cuenta a trav s de mi tel fono y me dice que debo descargar chrome en mi tel fono y ya lo tengo instalado
len ratingone  For the last few days my open tabs completely disappear when I leave the app 
len ratingone What the heck 
len ratingone I used to be able to have numerous tabs open leave and return at anytime amp they were always there 
len ratingone Ugh 
len ratingone This is awful 
len ratingone Fix to the way it used to be ASAP 
len ratingfive It s so great You can do everything schoolwork whatever you want
len ratingtwo It out of blue 
len ratingtwo I try everything block ads on top corner even I reset and clean up browsing history 
len ratingtwo None of them works please fix it 
len ratingfour The clasp is very small amp need to connect in the front 
len ratingfour And it is an lovely necklace 
len ratingfive I lov this app was great for my family but it is fun to play and play it
len ratingone I have had zero issues until today 
len ratingone While the app had never allowed desktop mode without switching EACH PAGE it at least worked when used 
len ratingone Today it has started only pulling up the mobile version even though it was switched to desktop and the site states it is in desktop mode 
len ratingone No settings can be changed or reset to change this 
len ratingone Looks like Google needs an update 
len ratingone On the new iPadPro which is updated appropriately 
len ratingone I ll edit update when fixed lt 
len ratingthree  There s one bug where I can t revert back to Mobile Mode when toggling between Desktop and Mobile Modes 
len ratingfive  I use it for the hub you know what im saying 
len ratingone I m waiting for iOS to be able to use Chrome as my default browser for Chrome for iOS is a disappointment when it comes to UX UI
len ratingtwo Bookmarks are buried deep down I wish the developers would pay effort in keeping them more accessible 
len ratingtwo A few other browsers in AppStore are better at doing this 
len ratingtwo Saving bookmarks and accessing them is a pain 
len ratingtwo Very little options to manage most visited websites 
len ratingtwo Search is fast no problems there 
len ratingtwo Overall a decent browser but needs to up its game if doesn t want to be beaten by MS edge 
len ratingone App won t copy to clipboard and WhatsApp web never works
len ratingfive im so happy i found this APP its like AMAZING and really ez to use
len ratingone I don t know if its boredom working at home during COVID but EVERYTHING that google had done since march has been garbage 
len ratingone The latest updates to chrome are just as bad as everyone has stated 
len ratingone You guys really need to not break something that is not broken just so you can fix it 
len ratingone At least apple doesn t normally break something just to fix it 
len ratingone Maybe you could learn something from them 
len ratingone Try and fix this update 
len ratingone It is almost as embarrassingly bad as your attempt to take on ZOOM 
len ratingone Boy was that bad 
len ratingfive Chrome and the knowledge they offer should be the foundation of all search domains and programs around the world 
len ratingfive The team at Chrome thinks of its users when developing their software and as a user I appreciate it deeply 
len ratingfive Thanks Again James Hoffman
len ratingthree Trust me 
len ratingthree My mom saw it
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingone Did not show up
len ratingthree I use this as my primary search tool but any time an update comes out it deletes all my tabs and it s super annoying 
len ratingone  QWe ww we we ewwwwrw wewwwwwwww www was we ww we a FUdsudiD 
len ratingone Ever since the new update I can t use chrome for more than minutes 
len ratingone Then it freezes I have to close it and then reopen it 
len ratingone But it doesn t matter at that point because the page I was on is now gone and it asks if I want to restore it 
len ratingone Even when it s restored I only have another minute or two before it crashes again 
len ratingtwo It took months for the fonts to be correct on Gmail then a new update to mess them up again If I wanted other apps to have access to Chrome I would have selected that option earlier 
len ratingtwo Don t like my security messed with Make Safari more appealing Loving my Chromebook less than a few hours ago
len ratingfive Porn Hub
len ratingone Stupid app
len ratingone The rating for this app really needs to be changed 
len ratingone I really don t want to change the restrictions on my years olds device to but they need chrome for school 
len ratingone This new update crashes every time I use it 
len ratingone This is a joke 
len ratingone I entered a web address and this app only searched 
len ratingone IT DOESN T go to the freaking website 
len ratingone I tossed it within minutes 
len ratingtwo I had Crome but editing mistake happening then every free app they are trying to charges fees now for even though it s free 
len ratingthree When I m in Chrome and I click a link to let s say Reddit Chrome gives me the option to open in the reddit app 
len ratingthree I hit that option and it takes me to the App Store instead of reddit 
len ratingthree Every time 
len ratingthree This has been happening only for the last few months 
len ratingthree So I have to go to reddit app and search for the title of the sub I was looking at 
len ratingthree This is so annoying 
len ratingthree Safari doesn t do this to me 
len ratingone I d had nothing but good things to say about Chrome and versatility as well as options and security until a few weeks ago 
len ratingone Suddenly my sync state was very behind 
len ratingone Now there is no sync 
len ratingone I was alerted today about a saved password breach and now absolutely nothing saves 
len ratingone Every time I open my browser I open to a blank slate with open pages lost 
len ratingthree Chrome has been crashing consistently after the update 
len ratingthree Don t download the new version 
len ratingfive Well this app is greatI don t know why anybody would review this app terrible
len ratingtwo I got it for school 
len ratingtwo So I wanted to go to google docs or a thing like that and it doesn t not work 
len ratingtwo I think this app is just a wasted 
len ratingtwo DO NOT DOWNLOAD 
len ratingone WhatsApp web is not working on the new chrome 
len ratingone Tell us to update 
len ratingone When there is no update 
len ratingone Pls help resolve this problem 
len ratingone I just update it and it will literally close all my tabs once it loads or if I even close out of the app at all to switch to another app 
len ratingone It closed all my tabs and it keeps doing this 
len ratingone It also keeps zooming in so much when I load in 
len ratingone I m going to have to switch back to safari this is so annoying 
len ratingfive  i cannot do anything without chrome
len ratingone Happened THRICE today 
len ratingone Good thing that I rarely use that horrible gmail app 
len ratingthree I love Chrome with all my heart but Jesus freaking Christ 
len ratingthree What in the 
len ratingthree  did y all do with this last update that every time I open a tab am trying to log in to my account on any site it FREAKING CRASHES EVERY DADGUM TIME 
len ratingthree PLEASE for the love of all things good amp kind fix it 
len ratingfive I love the save tabs and stuff I use it every day 
len ratingthree Started to use Chrome more on my cell phone but the experience really not smooth 
len ratingthree Once I entered Search it could bounce back to the previous screen 
len ratingthree Surprised to see Google could make an app with such quality 
len ratingfive Chrome is great but I m trying to up load a background for roblox on mobile but it when I click the chrome web store and type the app it says download chrome when it s already downloaded please do something
len ratingfive  If you don t like it your a loser it very easy you use
len ratingone I like using chrome in my macbook air 
len ratingone But for some reason it keeps crashing on my ipad pro 
len ratingfive Hola
len ratingfive Me la jalo en esta app
len ratingfive  chrome poop xdddd 
len ratingone  this issue started last week this needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed quickly or I will be using a different browser app 
len ratingtwo I m not happy with Chrome at the moment 
len ratingtwo Why did it delete all of my open tabs 
len ratingtwo Even the last page I was in gets deleted and I m only gone for a minute 
len ratingtwo What is wrong with Chrome 
len ratingtwo I m very unhappy as I had very important things saved in those tabs 
len ratingtwo Thank you Chrome 
len ratingtwo One of my used and favorite apps 
len ratingtwo But release to release becomes unstable with very large number tabs left open purposefully 
len ratingtwo When app crashes sometimes it will allow you to restore which is fine sometimes not then if you had tabs open over month period you can try to go back thru history but you are basically screwed 
len ratingtwo Can Chrome not ALWAYS allow a mechanism feature to go back to a tab state on a given date 
len ratingtwo That would be HUGE HUGE win 
len ratingfive I play krunder
len ratingtwo I ve never encounter a web browser app that loses all tabs if it crashes 
len ratingtwo The restore feature causes a second crash and it s all lost 
len ratingtwo Also pretty easy to just hit the close all tabs button 
len ratingtwo Which I don t understand why it s such an prominent button on the interface
len ratingfour Well this is kind of a problem for someone like google 
len ratingfour You need to add a setting so we can add our favorite websites on the google main page 
len ratingfour Also whenever I use YouTube it defaults to p which is weird 
len ratingfour Just fix these and I will be happy 
len ratingfive  I love google chrome it s the best browser out there 
len ratingfive Could y all add a reader mode similar to ho Safari does it 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingtwo I love chrome and use it for everything but this update makes it so hard to use 
len ratingtwo Everything has been switched around and is hard to maneuver 
len ratingtwo Will find a new browser if I have to 
len ratingtwo Latest update broke Animated GIF downloads 
len ratingtwo They no longer animate 
len ratingtwo Same picture downloaded with Safari is fine 
len ratingtwo I used to love google chrome as my phone browser 
len ratingtwo It was my go to 
len ratingtwo But now with the recent update it keeps closing every tab I open when I close out the google chrome app 
len ratingtwo It s super frustrating 
len ratingtwo Looks like I ll have to find a different browser app till this gets sorted out 
len ratingone I can t find file if download finished and I do not tap open in why do not automicly save to download folder 
len ratingone i just download GB file
len ratingfive I was unable to run WhatsApp Web on my phone s desktop
len ratingtwo Cannot update to chrome requested
len ratingone  Keeps opening closed tabs every time open Crome
len ratingfive love you
len ratingfive  I swear every few days this app will crash and leave me unable to press the restore button 
len ratingfive I spent hours upon hours gathering the tabs that were open 
len ratingfive This is the th time it s crashed like this and I needed to put vast efforts into bringing back the tabs 
len ratingfive The only reason I haven t switched to brave browser is because chrome is the only browser that allows me to translate pages 
len ratingfive Fixed the Damned Crashing 
len ratingfive Make the restore tabs button actually work 
len ratingfive And for gods sake ALLOW US to restore the previous session in other ways besides the initial restore button 
len ratingone You want to be fed lies and bs about a whole bunch of stuff you could find factual articals about anywhere else 
len ratingone Download google they will PUMP you full of lies that you take as facts have fun 
len ratingfive this is so secure and fast I don t see why everyone hate it I want stars already
len ratingthree I love the Chrome browser 
len ratingthree But I m about to move to using another because I keep closing all tabs and losing them because that dang button is close to the new tab button and my sausage fingers keep hitting it by accident 
len ratingthree My fault 
len ratingthree Sure 
len ratingthree Poor location design 
len ratingthree Yes 
len ratingthree I never ever want to close all tabs who even intentionally uses that button 
len ratingthree Please move to a much harder to reach location and I ll change my rating to five stars and use Chrome solely again 
len ratingone Every time the browser reloads itself I lose all the tabs that I had open 
len ratingone It doesn t consider it a closed tab so I have to go looking through history to see where I was 
len ratingone I got google chrome because Safari wouldn t save my bookmarks now it looks like I have to look for a new browser 
len ratingone Have been using Chrome on all devices for years 
len ratingone Since the last few updates ago it has been crashing pages have not been loading and I have been losing open tabs 
len ratingone Do better Google
len ratingone Can t tell you if the new version is good or not because I am told to buy another new Mobil phone to even use the app 
len ratingone Bs 
len ratingone Is chase gonna buy me a new phone that took me yrs to finally payoff this one 
len ratingone Bs not welcoming this as I can t afford a new phone but if it s about security issues idk 
len ratingone No longer a fan of Chase as I will look into another bank that I can access my accounts without upgrading my Mobil device 
len ratingone  Lost all my taps when this app suddenly crushed shouldn t count on it and leave my important searches to the next time and will never do again 
len ratingone recent tabs are no longer available after backing out of browser 
len ratingone automatically returns to google default page when opened again 
len ratingone obvious bug for ios 
len ratingone it s been happening for months 
len ratingone needs to be fixed 
len ratingfive Best app ever really works is the best
len ratingone For a week or two my tab changes aren t permanent 
len ratingone There was a specific set of tabs I had open a week or two ago that chrome keeps resetting to 
len ratingone It doesn t matter if I close them open new ones modify them 
len ratingone They ALWAYS end up exactly the same as that one set of tabs after I m done using the app
len ratingone Lately when I rotate my iPhone screen from portrait to landscape back to portrait again it messes up the page view leaving empty space on both sides 
len ratingone I then have to close page and reopen new tab to get normal view back This hasn t been fixed with last updates 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone  The news updates are trash 
len ratingfive Good browser and dinosaur game when offline
len ratingone  This version doesn t support WhatsApp web
len ratingone It s true
len ratingfive My computer is a butt it won t let me use chrome so I got it on my phone and it works way better thanks google for making this for a phone

len ratingfive Bad Ban
len ratingfive I m obsessed with naruto fanfics so this helps a lot 
len ratingfive THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST THING IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD
len ratingone I have decided to remove chrome from my desktop and laptop PC s 
len ratingone I have also removed google as my default search engine 
len ratingone I have done this because Google is censoring Conservative voices 
len ratingone YouTube is censoring conservative voices 
len ratingone Google is helping China sensor voices in that country 
len ratingone This is wrong and against American values 
len ratingone Therefore I am canceling Google 
len ratingtwo Why do you have to save a pdf so tricky its already bad on safari but way worse on chrome ios
len ratingfive  T t
len ratingthree Slow performance and crashing web pages 
len ratingone Their is no more tools this is the worse in iOS
len ratingfive I work mostly on my phone 
len ratingfive It would make my life easier if we can get a google form app 
len ratingtwo Constantly freezes when scrolling down news stories no way to disable automatically playing videos on websites bummer
len ratingthree It s good for porn
len ratingthree Chrome is me default browser but on my iPad it is junk and crashes all the time
len ratingtwo Latest release has a really annoying bug where the page doesn t display across the full width of the screen 
len ratingtwo Seems to mostly happen when you rotate to landscape then back to portrait 
len ratingtwo Only way to fix is to kill the tab and open in a new one 
len ratingtwo  Pro Max with iOS 
len ratingtwo  when fixed 
len ratingthree The translation pop up window is toooo big
len ratingtwo I used to love Chrome as it s my default browser on pc and it worked well on Android 
len ratingtwo But now that I m on iPhone Chrome crashes multiple times a day even when I m just reading a fairly basic website 
len ratingtwo I m constantly loosing my place 
len ratingtwo I guess it s time I switch to a different browser
len ratingthree Why can t the reading list sync with Chrome desktop 
len ratingthree  Ok so I like chrome but it is kinda scary and definitely is stealing data so idk but uh yeah

len ratingone Please fix this as soon as possible 
len ratingone Thank you
len ratingone Safari is better
len ratingone Pages randomly closing and not showing up in my history 
len ratingone Unreliable and pops up ads based on browser history and switches face book from web view to mobile view on its own
len ratingthree I try and change person but it just doesn t work 
len ratingfour The app keep crushing and all the open tabs closing 
len ratingfour Love the app but it need some improvement 
len ratingfive Title says it all sorry if you wanted a detailed review
len ratingfive  Yeah yeah
len ratingone When I rotate my iPhone Pro Max to landscape while browsing in chrome then rotate back to portrait the browser window resizes and cuts off parts of the web page leaving blank white space 
len ratingone Please provide a work around or fix for this 
len ratingone Chrome is my favorite browser otherwise
len ratingfive Awsome
len ratingthree  yall need to fix ur app why the hell does it not let me swipe anywhere like the app is not frozen yet the browser is unresponsive
len ratingone Sticking with Firefox as my go to browser 
len ratingone I never knew Chrome would be so bad on my new iPad Pro 
len ratingone None of my favorite websites load correctly 
len ratingone Looks terrible as well as not working 
len ratingone Forces way too many workarounds 
len ratingone Not to mention ZERO options and configurations
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Poggers
len ratingone Chrome is good for one thing lately crashing unexpectedly 
len ratingone I don t know how many times I have restarted chrome restarted my device uninstalled and reinstalled deleted temp files and cache used an incognito window and all the other BULLS T solutions suggested by Chrome 
len ratingone I have a new device and pay a small fortune every month for the highest speed internet available 
len ratingone Other than going on this review tirade I m not sure what else to do 
len ratingone At the end no this did not make me feel better 
len ratingone TRASH 
len ratingfour As a student Mobile chrome extensions would be game changer 
len ratingfour Any type of student who has a tablet instead of a laptop is at a crazy disadvantage 
len ratingfour The purchase of a laptop is seriously out of my range at the moment although with the help of google chrome it helps throughly but I NEED EXTENSIONS PLSSS
len ratingone I ve never had an issue with Chrome before the most recent update which was days ago I think 
len ratingone Now the app keeps crashing webpages won t format to fit my screen correctly and everything is generally much slower 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfour When there is a page with java script and sound it says An embedded page on this page says Unity content failed to load 
len ratingone Cancel chrome 
len ratingtwo I just got an iPad Pro while a lot of things are running desktop versions chrome is still stuck in the mobile version 
len ratingtwo Would love to see desktop version for iPadOS and my iPad would be complete
len ratingtwo  Everything was fine until I tried to download the update today 
len ratingtwo The update hung 
len ratingtwo Ultimately I had to delete the app and re download it 
len ratingtwo But now the icon is dead of the time and the app won t open 
len ratingtwo All my other apps are fine 
len ratingtwo I sent in a bug report one of the few times I could get the app to open and am also noting the problem here 
len ratingthree I usually use chrome so I can access my history and passwords from browsing on my laptop 
len ratingthree The app is fine but prefer to use safari if I don t need chrome 
len ratingthree This is primarily because of two reasons the close all tabs button and the lack of reading features on chrome 
len ratingthree I seem to always hit the close all tabs button when my finger is just resting on the screen and it s an absolute pain to go into my history and restore the tabs one by one 
len ratingthree Either move the button or allow me to restore all of the tabs I just deleted without making me tap through my history million times 
len ratingthree As someone who is an avid reader of online articles and stories the fact that you can t change the font size in chrome is appalling 
len ratingthree Sure you can zoom in but then you have to scroll left and right as well as up and down which sometimes ruins the immersion when I m reading a good story 
len ratingthree I might be nitpicking but these things drastically effect my experience with the app and I m sure that they wouldn t be that hard to change 
len ratingthree  Great browser in many ways though getting clunky in functions 
len ratingthree Misses many password autofills 
len ratingthree Oftentimes Chrome offers passwords to unrelated sites 
len ratingthree Super Work Stop when this happens 
len ratingthree Blocked at sites that have the correct one saved in Chrome already 
len ratingthree Not able to download a pdf onto iphone Blogs help all give inaccurate instructions PDF is common Chrome is uncommonly less useful than it used to be 
len ratingthree Good bookmark organizer Please cleanup these major issues
len ratingfive Thank
len ratingfive Just update dis ok
len ratingone  Third Update I tried Microsoft Edge and find it much less stressful than the constant website crashes on Chrome 
len ratingone There are some features that could be improved but overall I am glad to no longer be frustrated with websites constantly crashing 
len ratingone Had Google cared enough to fix that problem I would have been happy to stick with Chrome which I used for many years with no problems 
len ratingone After writing Google numerous times over the past year asking for a fix and being ignored I no longer care to use their product and thought I should share that here for others to see 
len ratingone Second Update After reading reviews about so many other people having these exact same problems for months now I decided to try Microsoft Edge 
len ratingone After about an hour of browsing not one website page crashed 
len ratingone I may end up deleting Google Chrome if the Microsoft app continues to impress me 
len ratingone It s a shame because I have used Google and Google Chrome for many years and was happy until these multiple problems started and continued getting worse 
len ratingone It shows me that Google does not care and now neither do I Update I downgraded my ratings to star from stars because of the continued problems and new problems us users are encountering 
len ratingone Websites are still constantly crashing which is not why we use a web browser 
len ratingone Now tabs and websites disappear after closing Chrome so either you go to history to find them or do not get to read what was saved in the tabs 
len ratingone I honestly expect more from a mega giant corporation like Google but it appears they are more interested in selling our private information than giving users a pleasant experience using their browser 
len ratingone This company has unlimited resources and the best talent available and can not give us a user friendly web browser 
len ratingone Something is seriously wrong and it is becoming apparent that Google inaction to fix known issues shows Google does not care 
len ratingone That is a shame and users deserve better 
len ratingone I used to love Google but lately it crashes constantly making it impossible to read and educate myself on the coronavirus newsfront 
len ratingone Numerous websites crash 
len ratingone I have written feedback asking for this to be repaired but so far hey have done nothing constructive to stop this problem 
len ratingone I am positive that if I am having this problem that numerous others do too 
len ratingone How about it Google 
len ratingone Want to make our experiences better and make this the pleasant app it used to be 
len ratingone Please stop using Google Chrome 
len ratingone Google abuses their position by doing the following 
len ratingone Nagging you to use Chrome on Google search 
len ratingone Intentionally making their services like Hangouts YouTube and Google Docs run poorly on other browsers 
len ratingone Adding new privacy features that add additional technical complexity to tracking you that hurts competitors for tracking and analytics while Google designs it in a way that it doesn t affect them 
len ratingone This has become less competitive with Microsoft caring less about Bing and Google is trying to kill Mozilla 
len ratingone Firefox market share conveniently also gets reduced by Google s tactics to make other browsers look bad 
len ratingone Google doesn t support the developer community like Mozilla 
len ratingone Mozilla provides the best documentation in the industry for HTML and JavaScript 
len ratingone Google is horrible at creating documentation look at Android 
len ratingone If you want a free and open web stop using Google Chrome 
len ratingone Google is trying to kill off all other browsers and make everyone use their engine tailored to their interests 
len ratingone Google is evil and should be broken up 
len ratingone Sometimes I open it and it crashes closing all my incognito tabs 
len ratingone No busca lo que le pido todo puros anuncios in tiles Yahoo al parecer es mejor que cromen
len ratingone Got so tired of Chrome app badgering me to download a google policy app 
len ratingone Finally just deleted it 
len ratingone Will stick to Safari for now 
len ratingone This browser is too failed
len ratingtwo Since I updated Chrome today it s developed a weird glitch that s really annoying me and I would like to have it fixed 
len ratingtwo For some strange reason although I close tabs a specific set continues to appear whenever I swipe close and open the app even if I ve deleted them 
len ratingtwo And I am also getting a NsCocoaErrorDomain that prevents any picture or file downloads 
len ratingtwo I did hard reset and check my phone for connection issues and updates but there doesn t seem to be anything wrong outside of Chrome 
len ratingtwo So to the Developers of Chrome please kindly find a way to solve this issue 
len ratingtwo  And please make Chrome stable again 
len ratingfive z ewww wex z xxe was a xs asia zs s zzz was the escapee ss ssws zz was z zwzzs Thank you
len ratingone It s plus stars
len ratingtwo First of all iPad Chrome is better than Safari a lot better 
len ratingtwo That said a LOT could and should be done to make it more customizable similar to the desktop version hello bigger fonts 
len ratingtwo The biggest problem is that they keep throwing out unstable new builds that end up requiring a lot more updates to get things right 
len ratingtwo In the last few hours alone I ve seen countless aww snap or whatever they call those sudden page crashes 
len ratingtwo On top of that the entire app will sometimes just collapse and die on me 
len ratingtwo Some sites and behaviors are more risky than others but the root cause is positively Chrome 
len ratingtwo I will prove it to you in a couple of weeks after they ve put out four or five more updates btw stop blaming the pandemic for everything and just reinvent how you work to end these types of development issues 
len ratingtwo If you have developers who are unwilling or unable to work effectively from home hire an unemployed disabled guy me who dreams of the opportunity 
len ratingone Every time I try to zoom in on a web page Chrome jumps back to the initial state 
len ratingone Double tap to zoom does not work everywhere on the screen just on the left side 
len ratingone Very clumsy to use
len ratingone Constant crashing weird formatting on a lot of sites since newest update 
len ratingone Muy lento
len ratingone Crashes like a blind kid driving a bumper car 
len ratingone Reinstalls do nothing app is unusable 
len ratingone I absolutely love chrome however it s been crashing so much lately 
len ratingone I can t even look up nothing on chrome anymore 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingtwo Loses all the incognito tabs each time it crashes 
len ratingtwo Bummer 
len ratingtwo I m sick of it
len ratingone I downloaded this app and it deleted my Notes app and replaced it with a Google Notes app but did not save any of my files within the Notes app 
len ratingone Fortunately the iCloud back up enabled me to restore my iPad to its previous condition and all of my notes which included many links to important data were restored 
len ratingone Without fail about seconds after opening browser it will freeze solid unresponsive and need to shut restart 
len ratingone Safari or Firefox have no such issues
len ratingone This is totally insane chrome offers to save username and passwords of websites you visit 
len ratingone When you go to setting you can reveal passwords to see the saved passwords 
len ratingone So what if someone took my phone and go to setting and see ALL my saved passwords 
len ratingone This is so INSECURE 
len ratingfive This is amazing
len ratingfour I ve always used chrome as my main browser but that has recently changed 
len ratingfour Whenever I want real information that s not censored or controlled I use other browsers 
len ratingfour They invade our privacy and control what we see what s the point of information you can t trust 
len ratingtwo Like the YouTube app Chrome on iOS is competent but seems clearly held back for iOS 
len ratingtwo Other third party browsers offer Chromecast support but Chrome does not on iOS 
len ratingtwo There s also no reader mode I ve found you cannot easily switch between accounts like on gmail and why is the share button at the top in the url bar instead of at the bottom in the overflow menu 
len ratingtwo I use Chrome on my MacBook so I m a fan though it is a memory hog 
len ratingtwo I would like Chrome on iOS to meet the standards of other mobile browsers 
len ratingtwo My guess is the Chrome iOS team is certainly working hard but not being given the support they need 
len ratingfive I love the app but man I wish they would move the Close all option to a menu or at the very least make a confirmation pop up before it closes EVERY page with no option to undo 
len ratingfive Several times I ve accidentally brushed that with my thumb and POOF 
len ratingfive everything is just GONE 
len ratingfive  gt 
len ratingfour  Chrome is one of the many apps I use on a day to day basis so why bother if I choose a different browser every single day 
len ratingfour I like the way how the browser syncs all of my things like bookmarks history and tabs on any device so I can access them whenever I need to 
len ratingfour Same goes for the data 
len ratingfour While I like the many features in the mobile version of Google Chrome I have found quite a few flaws 
len ratingfour Among them are the lack of extension support on PCs and Macs a reduced set of preferences limited ability to display the desktop version of some but not all websites and the ability to make Chrome the default browser in iOS as Apple does not allow it instead making Safari the default browser system wide in macOS this is no problem at all 
len ratingfour But otherwise this is a great app if you want to surf the Internet and rely on the power of Google on the go 
len ratingfour  And in the process saving lots of hassle 
len ratingtwo  UPDATE It s been weeks now since my previous review 
len ratingtwo Chrome is still broken to the point of being unusable 
len ratingtwo I switched to Safari for a while but now I ve moved on to Brave 
len ratingtwo As someone who owns a Chromebook I m really disappointed in the state of their browser 
len ratingtwo I ll keep checking from time to time to see if these issues get resolved but until they do I have to use different browsers for different devices because Chrome on IOS is broken 
len ratingtwo Biggest tech company can t even keep their flagship browser in a usable state 
len ratingtwo PREVIOUS REVIEW Chrome has a major glitch 
len ratingtwo Anytime I attempt to zoom into a website Chrome completely errors out with Aw snap and the entire website is gone and must be reloaded 
len ratingtwo This has been happening for weeks now and happens every time I try to zoom in 
len ratingtwo New issue has started 
len ratingtwo The browser can t sit still and keeps moving elements around 
len ratingtwo For instance text I m reading will jump up or down the page making it impossible to read 
len ratingtwo The only way to get around this is to keep one finger on the screen and keep slightly moving up and down 
len ratingtwo But not fingers because that can count as a zoom and as I mentioned above will break the browser completely with the Am Snap issue 
len ratingtwo Between these glitches Chrome has become unusable at this time 
len ratingtwo Chrome is broken as of writing this review 
len ratingtwo I ve gone back to Safari and will continually check up on Chrome until the devs finally work through these bugs 
len ratingtwo  Also I have copied my review as Apple s App Store has started a habit of removing my reviews 
len ratingtwo If they continue with this behavior I will simply re add my review each time 
len ratingthree b
len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingone But the worst part is that it gave me a button to restore all tabs so I went to close all of my open apps except Chrome to clear up my RAM I was about to press the restore button and then it went away on its own without me pressing anything because it was on a timer 
len ratingone Why is that a thing 
len ratingone What kind of pea brained person designed that 
len ratingone And I know it wasn t like that before because it used to show up on the bottom with an x button to close it 
len ratingone AND WHY IN GODS NAME IS THERE NO OPTION TO REOPEN ALL CLOSED TABS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE APP 
len ratingone Oh and I tried to open the tabs on my computer but it already managed to delete all of the tabs from my cloud sync without a second thought because of course it would 
len ratingfive  Exellent brwoser for iphone ipad and Mac
len ratingone Don t update crash
len ratingtwo When I either freakin searchin up sum it just freezes and there I go again having to reload it I wouldn t recommend IOS you use chrome just go to google no hate
len ratingone Haven t been able to use chrome on my phone for like three weeks at this point because it is crashing every time I attempt to open it 
len ratingone Disappointed in my typical go to browser 
len ratingfour Way too often my app crashes or doesn t shut down correctly and all the tabs I was saving are usually just lost 
len ratingfour The reload tabs button works but it s annoying to use because more often than not the thing disappears before I even get to tap or realize it 
len ratingfour Then boom all of my important information is just gone 
len ratingfour This app should be updated so the button stays on screen longer or is accessible semi permanently from a spot on the tool settings bar This is my only problem and I would greatly appreciate it being fixed thank you 
len ratingone Crashes constantly since updated 
len ratingthree Whenever I m on the shopping tab filter scrolling thru eventually it stops scrolling about halfway down 
len ratingthree Also when I open an item in a new tab it still opens up in the tab I m already on 
len ratingthree I opened it up in a new tab for a reason 
len ratingfive It s good for using incognito to watch pornhub
len ratingfive Chrome is amazingg 
len ratingfive I use it everyday 
len ratingfive It is very reliable and whatever u search pops up almost immediately 
len ratingfive Poopoopeepee ima reviewing weeeee
len ratingfive I whant to get fat now
len ratingfour Amalgamaticontainer s Will makes your up host
len ratingone I used to be able to change font sizes on my Chrome app on iPhone 
len ratingone Then today it s just magically gone 
len ratingfive I JUST LOVE THIS APP
len ratingone  and Chrome don t have an option to increase or reduce font text like safari 
len ratingfive Only works for one session 
len ratingfive If I use it later it quits to desktop after several seconds 
len ratingfive The only fix is reinstalling 
len ratingfive But then it does the same thing next session and I have to reinstall again daily 
len ratingfive Is there no crash log which allows you to see this is happening 
len ratingone Very dumb
len ratingthree I don t know what happened but the font accessibility is gone on my iPhone and I have a hard time reading the small text I ve looked everywhere in the chrome settings but can t find it 
len ratingtwo Everytime I restart the app or just open it again google chrome just deletes and opens a new brand new tab where I can search up things 
len ratingtwo The search history still exists but the tab gets deleted and replaced with a new one 
len ratingtwo Quite annoying honestly 
len ratingtwo Not sure if working as intended but I want a clear answer 
len ratingone When a got this a thought it would help me but no it didn t work every time I opened it it asked me to log in ever single time and after doing that it would crash 
len ratingone I don t recommend this crap app
len ratingfour Yu in my m y bcgu yu was h U 
len ratingfour Yes we Ttytyt yntnt Mom o on 
len ratingfour MB hi sweetie XX
len ratingfive Yeeeeeeeeet
len ratingfive It s awesome but I m kinda sad because my mom found I can go on SAFIRI at midnight so she got this for me 
len ratingfive It s pretty awesome but all I ever do on it is watch YouTube XD and I don t have much to say but I just think it s really good I just think it s kinda over powered 
len ratingfive If you know what I mean cool if you don t good for you 
len ratingfive I think I might be the only kid here but yeah 
len ratingone bad
len ratingone  Censorship of life saving information is a crime against humanity 
len ratingone Why is this happening 
len ratingone This is a serious and annoying bug 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive It I so good it is fast
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingone Clicked for update 
len ratingone Wouldn t update so I deleted so I could reinstall and now it won t come up as an option to download 
len ratingone Whenever I leave chrome in the background or close it I discover that it rolls back all progress I ve made in regards to browsing webpages and tabs opened when I reopen it 
len ratingone I ll be reading an article and go onto the next one and when I come back to chrome it ll be on the previous article 
len ratingone But that s not all 
len ratingone It rolls back to pages tabs I was last browsing days ago 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone This is really annoying as someone who does a lot of reading 
len ratingthree  The app works fine but need the option to make the app full screen
len ratingtwo Chrome has been killing my battery and making the phone very hot 
len ratingtwo  My iPhone ProMax gets noticeably warm merely browsing the web in Chrome 
len ratingtwo Too much freezing or lagging 
len ratingtwo I haven t noticed this much before or as bad in prior releases so I m going back Safari until Chrome starts performing less like a half baked beta product 
len ratingtwo I had no problem with Chrome for about a month and then everytime I tried to do something it restarted or glitched out and always resets the page 
len ratingtwo Sometimes it works fine but mostly it doesn t 
len ratingthree I can t screen shot web pages on my iphone 
len ratingthree It cuts off the corner where the speaker is 
len ratingthree It also won t let me resize it to be able to get the full page 
len ratingone  Second Update After reading reviews about so many other people having these exact same problems for months now I decided to try Microsoft Edge 
len ratingone After about an hour of browsing not one website page crashed 
len ratingone I may end up deleting Google Chrome if the Microsoft app continues to impress me 
len ratingone It s a shame because I have used Google and Google Chrome for many years and was happy until these multiple problems started and continued getting worse 
len ratingone It shows me that Google does not care and now neither do I Update I downgraded my ratings to star from stars because of the continued problems and new problems us users are encountering 
len ratingone Websites are still constantly crashing which is not why we use a web browser 
len ratingone Now tabs and websites disappear after closing Chrome so either you go to history to find them or do not get to read what was saved in the tabs 
len ratingone I honestly expect more from a mega giant corporation like Google but it appears they are more interested in selling our private information than giving users a pleasant experience using their browser 
len ratingone This company has unlimited resources and the best talent available and can not give us a user friendly web browser 
len ratingone Something is seriously wrong and it is becoming apparent that Google inaction to fix known issues shows Google does not care 
len ratingone That is a shame and users deserve better 
len ratingone I used to love Google but lately it crashes constantly making it impossible to read and educate myself on the coronavirus newsfront 
len ratingone Numerous websites crash 
len ratingone I have written feedback asking for this to be repaired but so far hey have done nothing constructive to stop this problem 
len ratingone I am positive that if I am having this problem that numerous others do too 
len ratingone How about it Google 
len ratingone Want to make our experiences better and make this the pleasant app it used to be 
len ratingone  I don t know what you all did in the last update but the font size is way too small 
len ratingone I have to go in on each window and manually increase the font size because you all can t leave anything alone 
len ratingone Fix this issue or I ll move to another browser 
len ratingone  Update I downgraded my ratings to star from stars because of the continued problems and new problems us users are encountering 
len ratingone Websites are still constantly crashing which is not why we use a web browser 
len ratingone Now tabs and websites disappear after closing Chrome so either you go to history to find them or do not get to read what was saved in the tabs

len ratingone I am positive that if I am having this problem that numerous others do too 
len ratingone How about it Google 
len ratingone Want to make our experiences better and make this the pleasant app it used to be 
len ratingfour It needs to add NIGHT MODE 
len ratingone i need to download it again n
len ratingone  So first off it closes all tabs I had open and because you guys can t search history based on device I couldn t find any of them again 
len ratingone Then you get stuck on the same three tabs opening every time I close and reopen the app even after I closed them all and opened new tabs 
len ratingone Then when I delete the app and reinstall it it isn t synced up with my google account at all unable to access the history or the bookmarks of my account 
len ratingone What is wrong with you guys 
len ratingone ROAR 
len ratingone Over the last few days it s been crashing and not entering my passwords 
len ratingone The option will be there to populate the user name and password into their respective fields but upon touching it it literal does nothing 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingone If I am not on WiFi I can t open this app to save my life I have an iPhone have downloaded the upgrades and still nothing
len ratingtwo I use chrome alll the time and it was working for me for the whole time but when I tried to put in my account because I wasn t using the one I wanted it accepted my email and it wouldn t accept my password 
len ratingtwo I know it s right and I ve tried it a hundred times but it just won t work
len ratingone So many times I ve searched for information and the results come up with something political 
len ratingone I used to be able to search for scientific information without political bias 
len ratingone Scary times when information can be controlled by companies 
len ratingone Going to try out Bing although I don t have high hopes 
len ratingfour The iOS version badly needs a reader mode option added 
len ratingfour Many times web pages are difficult to read without this feature which is great when used in Safari
len ratingone I downloaded the app to have access to my bookmarks 
len ratingone This is sadly not the case 
len ratingone You can log into the app with your google account the the app does not load your saved bookmarks 
len ratingthree Chrome is not the same on iPhone 
len ratingthree I m new to iPhone and there are sites that aren t laid out or formatted correctly 
len ratingthree It resizes things on certain sites improperly 
len ratingfive I love watching porn on it
len ratingone The news links displayed on an empty tap is really sad 
len ratingone The majority of articles are clickbait and random cat videos 
len ratingone I have a cat myself and I am not amused at all 
len ratingone Please show us some real news not a second clip of a cat watching someone eat a sandwich literally and title the news article Physco Cat 
len ratingone The article only had sentence followed by the video 
len ratingone Very sad 
len ratingone It was literally just a video of a cat just sitting there with it s eyes open 
len ratingone I should sue for the all the brain cells I lost watching that 
len ratingone Who job is it to pick articles and have them on chrome a year old 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingtwo Whatever the reason now when I open a link from Gmail I lose all my tabs and have to reopen them IF I can find them all Google needs to fix this both on iPad and Chromebook
len ratingone  Heavy glitches freezes and crashes on every single update 
len ratingone The updates are trash 
len ratingone I m so frustrated with google chrome update because it ruined my battery on my phone 
len ratingtwo lost all my tabs 
len ratingtwo Many times 
len ratingtwo Also the lt gt pop out window is kind of too small limiting what you see 
len ratingtwo Why not make it longer wider to accompany a longer title 
len ratingtwo Lots of space unused
len ratingone App crashes moments after being opened
len ratingfive Really good for mobile
len ratingone Chrome no longer saves open tabs when app closes 
len ratingone I lose all my open tabs when I close and reopen the Chrome app 
len ratingone After the latest update my tabs constantly crash with an oh snap screen even while not loading anything 
len ratingone I m now constantly losing all my tabs 
len ratingone Update It s a few days after writing my initial review I am now unable to load pages without the app crashing 
len ratingone This is unacceptable for a multi billion dollar company to be providing 
len ratingthree So am I just not finding this or after all the years and updates this is still not an option 
len ratingone Free Palestine
len ratingone Used to work just fine 
len ratingone Now it s garbage 
len ratingone It s freezes after seconds of using it on ANY website 
len ratingone I have an iPhone X and this happens even if this is the only app on 
len ratingone Trying to load a page 
len ratingone OH SNAP 
len ratingone In the middle of reading an article 
len ratingone OH SNAP 
len ratingone Checking out at your favorite merchant 
len ratingone OH SNAP 
len ratingone Giving up and going back to Safari 
len ratingone OH oh 
len ratingone Ok 
len ratingone  how can you screw up something as basic as bookmarks 
len ratingone folders are all over the place for no reason 
len ratingone you just have to bookmark to the bar and then use an actual computer to organize them 
len ratingone how is this even possible 
len ratingone The last tab I have opened no longer saves after shutting the app down 
len ratingone When I delete tabs and come back after shutting the app down the tabs reappear 
len ratingone The latest update is trash and should ve been fixed ASAP
len ratingone  After the latest update my tabs constantly crash with an oh snap screen even while not loading anything 
len ratingone I m now constantly losing all my tabs 
len ratingthree Not sure what happened recently 
len ratingthree Chrome was my favorite browser and now crashes constantly on iOS
len ratingfive  Bueno
len ratingone Please stop screwing things up 
len ratingone It worked 
len ratingone Leave it alone 
len ratingtwo Used this for years without issue 
len ratingtwo Now it crashes constantly on my iPad LTE 
len ratingfive  Admin ngon
len ratingone i m so sorry for google devs now because google is increasingly a flaming pile of poop 
len ratingone it s creators left and it s run by flashy modern bean counters now and boy does it show 
len ratingone search ignores terms operation symbols and pretty much everything 
len ratingone instead it does whatever it wants with lots of ads as well 
len ratingone photos barely works on the web for ipad pro and somehow the app is worse 
len ratingone easily half the features are broken it crashes it won t go back to a photo the photo goes black and etc 
len ratingone music 
len ratingone lol 
len ratingone who the hell knows anymore 
len ratingone of course messaging chat blah blah remains the mess it s always been 
len ratingone oh and if you peek behind the curtain your contacts are like spaghetti code personified 
len ratingone i am moving off google except for gmail to sign up for stuff mostly 
len ratingone it s a slow process because i used google heavily for many years all their social stuff keep music youtube oh and that blows too now but not totally yet photos mail drive and so on 
len ratingone and they kill stuff off endlessly 
len ratingone popular or not google doesn t give a fig 
len ratingone they won t pay to have apps vetted properly in the play store thus malware comes in waves unendingly 
len ratingone i used to love chrome books chrome browser androids 
len ratingone not anymore 
len ratingone gonna be all apple slowly slowly 
len ratingone apple remains user friendly 
len ratingone they improve things they add useful features while staying true to simplicity 
len ratingone they actually help if there is a problem 
len ratingone i can t even send feedback to google lately 
len ratingone it just crashes 
len ratingone sad 
len ratingone The chrome app for iOS is absolute trash 
len ratingone It crashes consistently and wipes out all of my tabs so frequently that I ve given up on it as my default browser 
len ratingone It s even more disappointing because I have a Windows computer and it would be GREAT to be able to use across my phone and laptop if it worked as it should 
len ratingone I get an aw snap crash message and or all of my tabs crashing daily 
len ratingone I ve taken the time to clear my cache and cookies and it s still trash 
len ratingone One star because I have to give it at least one 
len ratingone Something is messed up with this AND search after the last updates because they close randomly after less than minutes of use 
len ratingone It keeps resetting me back to previous day s tabs whenever I leave it alone for any length of time and I can not copy or paste anything outside of the link bar 
len ratingone Please fix this soon 
len ratingone I have had this app for years and loved it 
len ratingone However it has recently started freezing up to where the app does not respond to touch or my apple pencil 
len ratingone I don t know what they did but it hates me now 
len ratingone I m crashing at least every minutes and sometimes it doesn t give a restore option 
len ratingone If I try to open a link in either a normal or incognito tab it s blank 
len ratingone Finally it was crashing after seconds so I deleted the app 
len ratingone Nw it won t install 
len ratingone  Don t fix it if it s not broke guys 
len ratingone When you try you go to YouTube while watching a viedo by clicking YouTube in the left hand corner nothing happens 
len ratingone  I forgot Togo on incognito mode
len ratingfive I love almost everything about this app but it would be nice to be able to search your tabs up 
len ratingfive I have tabs and sometimes I would search up the same thing again 
len ratingfive The fact that they don t close your tabs after a time limit or tab limit is amazing 
len ratingone I will be very clear on my problems 
len ratingone When you use iPhone force touch to move the cursor 
len ratingone The app will hang up then freeze 
len ratingone Once it freezes it will freeze the phone and eventually the app will crash 
len ratingone Not only that I ve had it crash several times 
len ratingone I kept track times out of the month 
len ratingone That s at least times a year 
len ratingone Granted that not a lot 
len ratingone But that s not the frustrating part 
len ratingone The frustrating part when you have a tab open from a day or two ago like let s say YouTube video you want to watch later 
len ratingone Now it s gone no restore pages 
len ratingone Just a blank browser and you can t remember the name of the video 
len ratingone That very frustrating 
len ratingone Or like earlier I was responding to Google survey and suddenly the app decided to crash 
len ratingone After going through the questions that required a lot of thinking is all gone I m a heart beat 
len ratingone Did it save of course not 
len ratingone This is the web browser 
len ratingone For a tech giant I expected Chrome to never crash if rarely 
len ratingone Never once have I ever had it crash on my desktop yet it would crash on the phone pretty often 
len ratingone I don t keep many tabs open 
len ratingone So there shouldn t be an issue 
len ratingone Yet somehow there is 
len ratingone Maybe I should switch to Microsoft Edge 
len ratingone I like the look of their browser and I have tried it 
len ratingone Much much much faster on my IPhone Pro Max 
len ratingone  Heavy glitches freezes and crashes on every single update 
len ratingfive Everyone should play this app it s like Safari but better 
len ratingfive Guess what 
len ratingfive On this app you can play games on a computer 
len ratingfive I won t to look at that 
len ratingfive the game just downloaded 
len ratingfive  This app is amazing I am good at any device control and all control system is in google 
len ratingfive Sometimes I have glitches in my iPhone 
len ratingfive I can always fix my laptop but not phone 
len ratingfive When I got to App Store I was like it is only for laptop tap etc 
len ratingfive But when it wanted iD I was yeah it s not gonna work 
len ratingfive BUT when it worked 
len ratingfive I jumped in my bed soo many times I can t explain haha 
len ratingfive But I hope you add update I don t know what s it s called it starts with E maybe n 
len ratingfive I don t know but if you add that to phone controls your app will not only go crazy in laptop pc windows MacBook etc 
len ratingfive IT WILL GO CRAZY ON EVERY DEVICE ON EARTH 
len ratingfive  phones that is or tabs or other future devices so I m not complaining that these are not here 
len ratingfive I love it the way it is 
len ratingtwo The screen won t even fully refresh before Awww snap sadly 
len ratingtwo I like chrome but The recent update last week closed out all my tabs and again the week before that for no reason 
len ratingtwo So I lost a bunch of tabs I needed so that s lame 
len ratingtwo You can not screen shot an I tire page like you can I native safari 
len ratingfive Chrome 
len ratingfive Simply the best web browser I have ever experienced 
len ratingfive I ve been using it since the beta version wayback in the day and will refuse to use any other web browser on any other device 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is The proof that Google will one day rule the Internet even more than it is now and that s because well meritocracy 
len ratingfive trust it count on it 
len ratingfive it will make your browsing life easier 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive Thank you did genius Chrome team 
len ratingfive Mwah 
len ratingone App keeps crashing can t keep it open for more than minutes before it just closes 
len ratingone Definitely switching to something better 
len ratingfive just add a dark mode 
len ratingone  Hhh
len ratingone I disagree with you removing the name of Palestine from the map 
len ratingone Palestine in heart
len ratingthree  Google Chrime won t let me open the app and I signed out of it yesterday 
len ratingthree If you see my Chrime app open someone has hacked in it Today s date July 
len ratingthree This app is downloaded but won t open so I can log in
len ratingfive Gggfv
len ratingone  Long live Palestine
len ratingfive First I d like to start off by saying I have no idea why people leave reviews complaining about Chrome s lack of security and not giving the user personal space online 
len ratingfive Pretty much everyone I know uses Chrome unless there s some sort of issue with their specific model of computer that can t run it without glitching 
len ratingfive Even my parents who are tech nerds and have full time career jobs where they NEED all of their information secure still use chrome and encourage both my brother and I to use google products ESPECIALLY gmail and calendar 
len ratingfive I myself have grown up using chrome from the days I was first learning to type until now as I m an adult about to start college and writing this review 
len ratingfive While there was some time during the quarantine where I played around with the idea of using a different browser I kept coming back to this one 
len ratingfive Why 
len ratingfive Because it s seamless and neat and works like a charm 
len ratingfive Keeps all my passcodes secure and convenient to access while giving me a seamless browsing experience especially in the latest updates 
len ratingfive Everything loads super fast and images appear crisp and as high definition as my iPad Pro can render them 
len ratingfive The bookmarking feature on mobile could be slightly improved and I do miss my shortcuts when browsing on iPad instead of my computer but otherwise it works exactly the way I wanted to 
len ratingfive I ve tried many many browsers including Opera Firefox Edge Bing and DuckDuckGo which i keep in case I really want to have a super secure browsing session which is rare and more but chrome is by far the best and most convenient 
len ratingfive I ve even tried the alternative mobile app Google and while it seems more obviously feature rich I absolutely hate the layout and much prefer the far more popular Chrome app for its simplicity and power 
len ratingfive So if you re really that worried about chrome not being secure enough for you think about exactly what data you don t want them to track stop complaining about it to other people and download a browser like DuckDuckGo which was made for people who value their online privacy 
len ratingthree  Google Chrime won t let me open the app and I signed out of it yesterday 
len ratingthree If you see my Chrime app open someone has hacked in it Today s date July 
len ratingone This is the rd time that chrome crashed and lost saved tabs in the past months 
len ratingone I searched for fixes only to find that others have had the same problem with no solution available 
len ratingone My solution at this point is to use a different browser 
len ratingone Keeps dropping all my tabs saying it wasn t shut down properly any time I momentarily switch to using another application 
len ratingone It allows me restore the tabs but any input when filling out forms is lost 
len ratingone For example I was filling out a form in chrome swiped to access an order number in my gmail so I could copy and paste it into the proper field in chrome and now all my information is erased 
len ratingone I ll correct my rating and stop using using dreaded safari once you guys figure it out 
len ratingone  Palstine
len ratingone Haven t been able to use for weeks and the last update fixed nothing still closes all my tabs almost every time I open chrome and they are not listed under recently closed tabs so I have to go through my history to find the pages I was using also no longer able to copy paste or save photos 
len ratingone Chrome went from being my favorite browser to being uninstalled today on mobile device 
len ratingone Got tired of trying to fix it or needing to adjust every web page to read it 
len ratingone Using iPhone X 
len ratingone Made no changes to phone settings prior to or after update but now have two big issues 
len ratingone Chrome keeps loading pages way too large 
len ratingone It ignores phone font size settings and pages fonts dialog boxes are huge 
len ratingone Continually need to adjust every page using the zoom making it smaller 
len ratingone Browser history won t delete 
len ratingone I go through the process of clearing the history over and over and guess what the history is all still there 
len ratingone No issues with the PC or laptop version but Chrome won t be on my phone until fixed 
len ratingone  Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine
len ratingfive Thx App Store 
len ratingone Force you to sign in and it gathers data from your account 
len ratingone had anyone heard of common sense or logic chrome is not secure if want the most secure browser go to tor org you won t be disappointed and use DuckDuckGo com as your search engine
len ratingone  Free Palestine
len ratingthree  so Done just tried to HACK into my Chrome Google com
len ratingone  Put Palestine on the map you have no right to erase a country that is a crime it s self 
len ratingone You have no dam right to erase a whole population 
len ratingone  Free Palestine
len ratingfive Been using Google and their apps for years now 
len ratingfive I learn something new each day 
len ratingfive Love them 
len ratingfive They make my forgetfulness much easier to deal with because if I cannot remember something I use my google search and it most likely finds what I am trying to remember whether it was a email or anything 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this company 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingthree The find in page for pdf is always greyed out 
len ratingthree I have to open it in Adobe to use that function 
len ratingthree Alternatively I have to use another browser like Safari that allows it 
len ratingthree Every day I use Chrome a web page crashes 
len ratingthree Most unstable app ever 
len ratingfive On my iPad there has been no problems with this app 
len ratingfive I think it is better than Google because it can open multiple tabs not one 
len ratingfive Now I can listen to my favorite music and do other things like that 
len ratingfive Thank you for making this app and I am giving it a five star review to say thank you to the developers of this really amazing app 
len ratingtwo  They threw out all my open tabs and I now no longer have the option to start where I left off 
len ratingtwo I use my phone to air play a lot of shows online and I can t always remember what episode I left off on so this is a big problem for me 
len ratingtwo I ll give the developers a couple more weeks to fix this otherwise I m sadly going to have to switch 
len ratingfive Epik cool cheeks certified by Walter clements
len ratingone  Put palestine back on the map
len ratingone fix that plz
len ratingone First off I used to love google then they became too greedy and it started when they bought YouTube 
len ratingone They love keeping your data to sell you more things and what not 
len ratingone Basically google became a big ad company it s ridiculous and wrong 
len ratingone Firefox keeps your data safe and is simple to easy and faster too 
len ratingone  New review is the same because this garbage app just threw away all my open tabs AGAIN 
len ratingone This is the digital equivalent of book burning 
len ratingone Only I after explicit permission is granted should be allowed to delete all tabs bookmarks and history 
len ratingone This wasn t the problem today but why is there a stupid button prominently displayed to be easily hit by mistake 
len ratingone Sure I have a backup for the data but I don t have the week it will take to manually do the complete restore 
len ratingone Idiots 
len ratingone Old review There was a popular request to remove a useful feature 
len ratingone Are you going for professional stupidity or still trying to maintain your amateur status 
len ratingone You do know that you have competition from other browsers besides Safari don t you 
len ratingone Original review Other devices not so much Why do the tabs from other devices disappear after so many days 
len ratingone They should remain until crack of doom 
len ratingone This is like having a spare tire that must be inflated with air from another tire 
len ratingone I can only access other tabs from another device as long as I have recent access to said device so why wouldn t I just use that device instead of this one 
len ratingone  Faults 
len ratingone Not smooth running 
len ratingone Tracks you all time You shouldn t be allowed tracking and selling information of people 
len ratingthree  Every day I use Chrome the web page crashes 
len ratingtwo  The news feeds on this app just sit always the same feeds never a change
len ratingfive I like this app 
len ratingtwo Whereas with Safari most sites are too tiny to read with Chrome they come out too big to read 
len ratingtwo Words and letters hanging off the screen no way to scroll sideways to try to read it 
len ratingtwo Only good thing is that I don t get those useless mirror pages I get with Safari 
len ratingone Extremely anti free speech 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingone And weird performance issues
len ratingfour I really like this app because it let you do more things on it and keep your privacy for your self
len ratingone Do as all a favour don t change anything ever more coz now it looks and feels awfull like a kindergarten work bring back the version before infamous update what s wrong with you if it s not broken don t fix it
len ratingone This use to be My favorite browser but in now everything is jumbled on webpages they are showing up misformatted inconsistent fonts misaligned css and overlapping images but they appear fine in other iOS browsers 
len ratingone  This app crashes on the recent update 
len ratingone It doesn t work and slow down on the crashes 
len ratingone I m woman and I want some respect 
len ratingone Heavy glitches on the recent broken update 
len ratingone  Any google application watches what you do on the internet 
len ratingone They track all your internet use and what where you go 
len ratingthree Safari doesn t allow audio hoping chrome will allow audio for zoom meetings
len ratingone Chrome keeps crashing and closing all my tabs and windows 
len ratingone  Horribly unstable 
len ratingone Do not use on apple Lost ALL my current open pages AGAIN This is a bastardized version of chrome To save pages it s takes digging down two levels below WAY less useful commands BUT the clear all button is where it can be grabbed by accident and there is no confirmation needed to trash all you searches 
len ratingone And unlike the full version on desktops there is no restore function
len ratingone Keyboard shortcuts are unresponsive and no multi user support which is just bad 
len ratingone Worst mobile browser ever 
len ratingone Not secure at all sells info on every other site if in incognito mode
len ratingone  This is safari made up to look like Google Chrome totally useless
len ratingthree Since the latest update my passwords usernames won t fill in anymore 
len ratingthree Even when I see the option pop up to use a sn or pw and click it it won t populate the field 
len ratingthree I ve closed and open the app 
len ratingthree Restarted iPhone and even cleared the memory 
len ratingthree Please help 
len ratingthree Otherwise I love the app but this is a huge deal for me 
len ratingthree I use chrome for work and constantly log in and out of sites 
len ratingthree Thank you
len ratingfive I would like to request the app chrome to be rated age amp that I can search for everything I would love to see if the age can change to be Thank You
len ratingone Chrome is so terrible now I had to switch to Firefox on all of my devices 
len ratingone Lots of issues on all my devices with chrome and with their blatant disregard for data security
len ratingone There is no way to increase or decrease the size of the page 
len ratingone Kinda disappointed from Chrome On iPad 
len ratingone  This app crashes on the recent update 
len ratingone It doesn t work and slow down on the crashes 
len ratingone Since the new update all of my bookmarks are now completely out of order 
len ratingone I have to manually sit and try to put them back in alphabetical order which takes quite a bit of time to do 
len ratingone Please correct this issue 
len ratingone The dark mode that you added to app is very bad
len ratingone  When you search for something the first pages are all ads and are not the best answers to what your looking for 
len ratingone Having to scroll down to determine what s your best answer and what s just an ad is extremely annoying 
len ratingone You got to greedy Google 
len ratingone And now your browser is crap 
len ratingtwo I rarely use this app since it is so unstable that it can t hold a website for more than a few seconds before crashing 
len ratingtwo Yes I have tried all the fixes resetting it reloading it clearing the cache and browsing history 
len ratingtwo Just awful 
len ratingfive It helps with my schoolwork and I have no problems or complaints thank ya LiVy AwEsOmE 
len ratingfour It get so annoying when it crashes so much 
len ratingfour Like reload reload reload 
len ratingfour While safari and prob other platforms simply reload itself rlly quick 
len ratingone Where s the iPad app for Chrome 
len ratingone I downloaded the app and it s only a mobile version 
len ratingone I m constantly having to request desktop view in order to view websites correctly 
len ratingfive  Love it the only thing I wish it would do is open mail links in Chrome instead of Safari 
len ratingfive  Using the default mail app on iPhone 
len ratingone  My thing has been loading for over an hour please help
len ratingthree Just recently the app will no longer open 
len ratingthree It starts to then freezes then closes 
len ratingthree Restarted my phone several times and no luck 
len ratingthree Haven t tried to reinstall but I had a few things open I didn t want to lose 
len ratingone  I like Chrome even the new version in the abstract 
len ratingone It s a solid browser highly standards compliant 
len ratingone But I know if I use it especially if I log into a Google account my privacy is gone 
len ratingone I understand why some are willing to make the trade off 
len ratingone If you go all in with the Google world the various bits integrate well 
len ratingone And maybe privacy is just an abstract concept to some 
len ratingone But it s not to me 
len ratingone Google used to say Don t be evil i e like Microsoft 
len ratingone That ship sailed long ago 
len ratingone So I ll keep using Firefox 
len ratingone They have their issues but compiling a complete dossier on my browsing habits and my life isn t one of them 
len ratingone I hate the new layout 
len ratingone looks like safari or Firefox app 
len ratingfour It is so easy to use delete history close tabs but however you don t get good FPS you should use brave browser or this 
len ratingfive Yes 
len ratingtwo Resembles desktop Chrome 
len ratingtwo Used to work well 
len ratingtwo Now generally on pages with ads and which don t any more produces Aw Snap error very frequently 
len ratingone  This was my favorite browser but now almost anytime I go into it it completely closes whatever tabs I have open and just noticed that it no longer lets you save pictures I literally have to reopen the link in safari in order to save and no word in if they are aware of this and are in the process of fixing
len ratingthree It keeps crashing
len ratingthree Chrome needs to take advantage of iPadOS and make all websites be the full desktop experience
len ratingthree This is only a little good because it s another browser to watch porn
len ratingfive It s awesome and works fast 
len ratingfive I like times more than safari 
len ratingone Chrome keeps shutting down and I m losing my tabs and it s so annoying this app used to be perfect 
len ratingtwo Both google amp chrome have gone from very good to very bad 
len ratingtwo Crashes freezing more ads than actual websites 
len ratingtwo What is wrong 
len ratingfive This is the best noobs
len ratingone Both Chrome and the Google app are fully of bugs and laggy 
len ratingone I switched to the Bing app and Edge and am much happier 
len ratingone Still use Chrome on my PC though don t know what s wrong with Google s mobile development department
len ratingone I don t know what the hell you did but apparently every time I go to Google Chrome and search for something it s just clock out like why does it do that even if It resets everything on my private media I can t get I had to download a different search engine either fix it or I m done with this
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive When reading the tabs slot doesnt shrink when swiping down
len ratingone App is crashing more and more often 
len ratingone Only one tab open cache history etc has been deleted 
len ratingthree  Cdgwvcgvdacgdcghvsdugcgwdvycasucxufsacxufz ffcSufxcxfasuxcuafscxufacxuafscxufasc
len ratingfive It does just I want 
len ratingfive Can t believe kids are reading this app low just so Apple could get rid of it and I love this app I don t know why they would do this but I hope that this app gets stay put in the App Store so everybody everybody can use this
len ratingfive Good
len ratingtwo The app was great a couple months ago but it s update from around two months ago ruined it 
len ratingtwo Now it automatically zooms in when a page loads and there s no way to prevent it from doing so unless you manually zoom out but then it ll return zoomed in when the page reloads 
len ratingtwo Annoying 
len ratingfour  It showed roblox 
len ratingfour Not alowed because of stalkers 
len ratingfour Please fix safari 
len ratingfour Why 
len ratingfour But I love derp comics 
len ratingone App loads buuuuuuut half of the website loads up and refreshing don t work on the sites I go on no pictures show up only the website shows and nothing else
len ratingfour  I would ve gave it stars because it is very good 
len ratingfour but the fact that I can t turn off third party cookies bothers me 
len ratingfour I don t believe I need to be spied upon and I would hope that you would support my privacy
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingone Seriously please 
len ratingone Have a prompt 
len ratingone Or move it to a spot that s pushed less on accident 
len ratingone I actually think it just automatically closes all of them periodically and I can t tell you how frustrating it is 
len ratingone The app is basically perfect other than this fatal flaw 
len ratingone Chrome never shuts down properly and it always deletes all my important tabs I have up 
len ratingone  Whenever I try to access websites with my google account my school google account I use the same one for my school issued laptop and chrome for iPad a blurb comes up warning me about the device policy alert and another alert is there too saying I need to update something and I follow the steps but it keeps coming up 
len ratingone Please help me 
len ratingone I need to use chrome for iPad to read my school emails and to do other things like practice French and access academic platforms like Schoology and clever applications 
len ratingone I promise the app was amazing before this issue and if you help me I ll change my rating to 
len ratingone Again PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET RID OF THE DEVICE POLICY ALERT SO I CAN ACCESS WEBSITES WITH MY GOOGLE ACCOUNT 
len ratingone If you can help me THANKS A MILLION if you can t 
len ratingone  Both versions started freezing on 
len ratingtwo Great browser overall but I can t stand it anymore 
len ratingtwo The recent versions keep closing all my open tabs without me clicking close all 
len ratingtwo And they don t show up in my recently closed list 
len ratingtwo At this point I don t trust this feature anymore 
len ratingtwo I was using it as a read it later sort of thing but it s too unreliable 
len ratingtwo Might switch to Safari as it knows how to keep track of open tabs 
len ratingtwo Contacted support but didn t hear back 
len ratingtwo Google please fix it 
len ratingtwo Many people are experiencing this as I m sure you are aware 
len ratingtwo Was not happening in the previous version of the app 
len ratingone Well I guess I m tired of chrome crashing on me all the time 
len ratingone I was one of the early adopters but now it just doesn t stay up 
len ratingone I have a lot of tabs open yes but it just randomly crashes 
len ratingone I would like to go back to using it but for now I m gonna get my links out of the history and use a different browser 
len ratingone BTW This seems to be systemic because it occurs on the PC as well
len ratingtwo  Chrome has a major glitch 
len ratingtwo Anytime I attempt to zoom into a website Chrome completely errors out with Aw snap and the entire website is gone and must be reloaded 
len ratingtwo This has been happening for weeks now and happens every time I try to zoom in 
len ratingtwo New issue has started 
len ratingtwo The browser can t sit still and keeps moving elements around 
len ratingtwo For instance text I m reading will jump up or down the page making it impossible to read 
len ratingtwo The only way to get around this is to keep one finger on the screen and keep slightly moving up and down 
len ratingtwo But not fingers because that can count as a zoom and as I mentioned above will break the browser completely with the Am Snap issue 
len ratingtwo Between these glitches Chrome has become unusable at this time 
len ratingtwo Chrome is broken as of writing this review 
len ratingtwo I ve gone back to Safari and will continually check up on Chrome until the devs finally work through these bugs 
len ratingtwo  Also I have copied my review as Apple s App Store has started a habit of removing my reviews 
len ratingtwo If they continue with this behavior I will simply re add my review each time 
len ratingone Sometimes whenever i search the exact same title of a video i m looking for the results are too vague 
len ratingone It s irrelevant 
len ratingone Another issue is that i have my current location locked on google and weather system isn t showing me the right weather in my area 
len ratingone I ve been observing for the past few weeks and i have been seeing many thunderstorm reports 
len ratingone And guess what 
len ratingone It didn t even rain 
len ratingfive HEHE
len ratingone  I don t know what s going on with this app it was my go to but now every time I open it all of my previous tabs have been closed and I also get an error every time I try to save a photo
len ratingtwo If you re going to have a close all tabs button either have a prompt to say are you sure you d like to close or at least a button to recover everything 
len ratingtwo I typically have dozens of tabs open and probably on four or five occasions I ve lost everything 
len ratingtwo Switching to Safari now until this is fixed 
len ratingtwo  I don t know what happened to Chrome 
len ratingtwo I ve been using it for years and NEVER encountered bugs 
len ratingtwo At least none that I could see or feel 
len ratingtwo Now I have bugs on desktop and iOS that constantly frustrate me 
len ratingtwo I have slowly been switching to the new Microsoft Edge 
len ratingtwo It is built with the same Chromium engine and Blink rendering engine 
len ratingtwo But it uses less RAM than Chrome has way less bugs as of this writing and just feels like a breath of fresh air 
len ratingone Latest update repeatedly removes open tabs without a way to restore 
len ratingone It freezes and keeps closing my tabs and kicking me off the app so I can t even restore them and it doesn t show them in recents or history so it s difficult to find them again 
len ratingone  Comcast is charging for bandwidth used and chrome like all other browsers lets we pages waste my bandwidth with auto playing videos 
len ratingone It crashes constantly and is very annoying
len ratingfive It s actually really great 
len ratingfive i prefer it more than google 
len ratingfive i say you should buy it 
len ratingone Tried uninstalling and reinstalling keep getting Aww Snap constantly across all websites app has always been prone to obnoxious popup ads it seems to run every garbage and spam script out there with no filter I will have to start using a different browser from here on out 
len ratingone  Bring back the google search button in the middle of the bottom of the screen and move the tab button 
len ratingone Why must google always add great products and features just to discontinue them 
len ratingone It s like you guys get enjoyment out of making people s experience worse 
len ratingone  The browser will frequently and randomly delete all open tabs 
len ratingone Do not use this for projects over time because the app will completely screw you over 
len ratingone Absolute trash 
len ratingtwo I dont like this new update dont you mind if you could change it please
len ratingfive  The web store dosent work on chrome for iPad but really good
len ratingone Chrome literally spies on me 
len ratingone EVERY time I would be having a conversation about something I would get on YouTube the second I was done talking and EVERY SINGLE ad was EXACTLY about what I was talking about 
len ratingone  DON T GET IF YOU WANT YOUR CONVERSATIONS PRIVATE 
len ratingone Anytime I try to download an app it won t let me go to the downloads to open the app and even if I do get there it says the app can t open it and I know it s not a virus because I was able to use the app without viruses on a different device 
len ratingfive Add a dark mode my eyes are bleeding
len ratingone It used to be good it was the only browser I used the newest update somehow zoomed everything up unable to read and look at most things I had to switch to another browser
len ratingone Aw snap is all I get for the past few months if I owned stock in Google id be saying Aw Sell if this is the sort of half baked crap they put out 
len ratingone Some Google apps licenses amp other info downloaded with them will erase the NEVER option on the Do Not Disturb feature of IPhones 
len ratingone Can be bothersome 
len ratingone  It s constantly crashing and I lose all of my open tabs 
len ratingone It s done this countless amounts of times 
len ratingone It doesn t even give my the option to restore my recent tabs 
len ratingone If I could I would give it stars 
len ratingone Doesn t work and is always crashing now 
len ratingthree  I am a frequent chrome user on my MacBook 
len ratingthree However the app leaves a bit to be desired 
len ratingthree I like that you can sync your devices browsing histories 
len ratingthree That s a plus 
len ratingthree The biggest negative for me is the location of the close all button on the bottom left of the screen 
len ratingthree I am a person that leaves TONS of webpages and tabs open for reference later 
len ratingthree Unfortunately on more than one occasion while moving around pages or swiping I have accidentally selected close all 
len ratingthree I wouldn t be so upset if there was an options to open all recently closed tabs similar to the computer browser a confirmation prompt that asks Do you want to close all tabs or move the location of this option elsewhere maybe into the settings 
len ratingthree As a result I have started using another web browser that has the open recently closed tabs feature available 
len ratingthree FIX THIS GOOGLE 
len ratingthree I want to go back to using chrome 
len ratingthree it gives me setting up maps I want the chrome page not maps 
len ratingone  The first thing I do when I get a new iPhone is I download Google Chrome 
len ratingone I absolutely love it and even though it doesn t offer a reading mode it still the best mobile browser 
len ratingone Now they ve totally ruined it 
len ratingone Reading mode gets rid of ads so they figured lets make our version make everything more readable by blowing it up even if it ruins the overall layout of the page 
len ratingone I dislike Safari on iPhone but I guess I m gonna have to settle for that 
len ratingone At least until they fix Chrome 
len ratingone As far as I can tell there is no permanent fix for frequent Aw Snap errors 
len ratingone After taking the steps Chome suggests and searching forums it seems that the app is just badly coded 
len ratingone The error happens so frequently the browser isn t useable 
len ratingfive I
len ratingfive Lilkkkkkk KIDZ dividen desoves discus f tbol del defensa start sentimientos dist nciense no se puede ser un gran d a de verdad que me voy al cielo con la verdad y me lo das dichotomizations sus entretienen substantiating cenicero inexplicable poop
len ratingone  Yeah it s an older iPhone but it shouldn t constantly crash 
len ratingone My suspicion is that the phone can t handle the proliferation of auto play videos and pop ups now in use on webpages 
len ratingone I d love to see an older phone mode or just better support for older phones 
len ratingone Used to prefer this app for browsing over ANY other and now it is the WORST 
len ratingone I am constantly having to select desktop site when browsing and even then it STILL changes it back to mobile view 
len ratingone Some sites will not work in mobile view 
len ratingone It took me hours to get a minute project done because of this 
len ratingone Never using this app again
len ratingthree What I don t like is that I can be in the middle off an article or watching a video and I ll start rewording the page over and over I cant never finish what I m doing do to this glitch I guess it is 
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive z Lax 
len ratingfive Er Tagg We are sorry I Y Ok Trimming one knife and o
len ratingone Brave is the same thing but it doesn t cram political views Down your throat 
len ratingfive We canSearch up anything on Google Chrome it s like so awesome I can search up anything on here that I like this is awesome I love this app 
len ratingfour Bruh 
len ratingone I m very disappointed 
len ratingone This app is completely unreliable 
len ratingone Every time I load a page it gives me the Aw Snap error 
len ratingone I ve tried all of the fixes and none of them worked 
len ratingone If this is the best browser then I m scared to see what the others are like 
len ratingtwo It worked a lot better before but now every time I m away for it for about to minutes when I go back to it it ll say chrome failed to load pages and it ll have the restore button but before I can restore the pages it ll crash again and I ll have to go to my history or recent tabs in order to get the pages I had back 
len ratingtwo I really enjoy this app but this has been making it really hard to use 
len ratingone Not happy with only able to have custom bookmark icons on home page
len ratingone Previous versions you could go into chrome flags and deactivate the flag named Enable New Tab button in the bottom toolbar 
len ratingone That flag has been removed and thus forces the New Tab button to be on the tool bar 
len ratingone Stupid stupid stupid decision 
len ratingone Bring back the Search function in the toolbar 
len ratingone  I hate you fix that
len ratingone I did not sign up for live chat during my mass 
len ratingone This Is a terrible distraction from this beautiful service to have constant bubbles of words popping in over the sacrament 
len ratingone I want it to stop now 
len ratingone  Hate this app evil pop ups and cache does not clear when you tell it to 
len ratingone Cookies remain there 
len ratingone Annoying I have to delete app and reinstall to get it to clear 
len ratingone Chrome in my opinion is way worse than opera and opera touch 
len ratingone Chrome is made to have trackers to take all your personal information 
len ratingone Also it is full of ads 
len ratingone If you don t like those two things then try opera or opera touch on mobile 
len ratingtwo  In all other apps the normal keyboard proved by apple is used 
len ratingtwo However in chrome they add a period key next to the space bar 
len ratingtwo As my ability to type on a mobile device has been dictated by the normality of the apple keyboard 
len ratingtwo Adding a period key right next to the space bar causes all google searches to be convoluted by the need to search for periods where there are none 
len ratingtwo I only complain because people will say be more aware however above the keyboard are HTML standard symbols 
len ratingtwo Put the period there with everything else 
len ratingtwo When I m filling out forms that require my email account a com is provided in the same space above the keyboard 
len ratingtwo The period key is a stupid nonsensical useless troublesome hideous idiotic idea 
len ratingtwo Whoever developed it should be kicked out of the office building and to dictate a letter to the CEO or HR department why they should be let back in using this crippled keyboard 
len ratingtwo A period is not need 
len ratingtwo Writing this review all I have to do is hit the space bar twice to crate a period 
len ratingtwo Which takes the same amount of effort if a period marker were there next to it 
len ratingtwo Meaning we do not need a period marker 
len ratingtwo All that to say chrome works fine 
len ratingtwo Never have a problem with it besides the period marker 
len ratingtwo But it only gets two stars because it has the absolute diseased mind to force a period key where there is not one needed 
len ratingtwo Losers 
len ratingtwo  I loved chrome I don t know what happened on the latest updat 
len ratingtwo It shows words all gargled up on my iPhone now 
len ratingtwo I just download MS new Edge 
len ratingtwo Wow 
len ratingtwo Who would have thought MS stepped up their game 
len ratingtwo Its great 
len ratingfive  For real
len ratingfive My kind that is 
len ratingone I am so tired of constantly getting that error message no matter what website I try to go to 
len ratingone Deleting 
len ratingone Please build a more stable platform and I may come back 
len ratingtwo Can t save images to photo roll any more and uploading photos to Facebook comments crashes chrome now 
len ratingtwo Been acting up since the last update 
len ratingone The worst port ever
len ratingone The letters look tiny while surfing the web 
len ratingone I m not having this problem on Firefox or Safari 
len ratingone Unfortunately I won t be able to use this particular app until the problem is fixed 
len ratingtwo This used to be my preferred web browser but as of a week ago it won t stay open longer than seconds before crashing and exiting itself 
len ratingtwo I ve tried deleting and re downloading the app but no change 
len ratingtwo I hope they can fix this or I m stuck with Safari 
len ratingone Your new UI is awful 
len ratingone Why is the bottom chunk where the buttons are so huge 
len ratingone Also when I m on a lot of sites Facebook Reddit to name a few there s a big giant scroll bar right in the middle of the text 
len ratingone It s so ugly too 
len ratingone The old style was sleek and way more user friendly 
len ratingone Why in the tech world is it always a story of fix it if it ain t broke 
len ratingfour ONE SUGGESTION THEN APP WILL BE PERFECT DARK MODE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE 
len ratingfour The only downside to Google Chrome in my opinion is the impossibility of placing favorites on the first page
len ratingone Most recent update for iPhone is to zoomed in 
len ratingone If you re going to sell your soul to the devil at least have an app work correctly 
len ratingone Chrome crashes randomly 
len ratingthree I have no idea why but every once an a while maybe every months all of the tabs that I have opened in both incognito and regular get deleted and I have no idea why
len ratingone Same bug unable to use keyboard shortcut to switch between tabs with smart keyboard iPad Pro inch 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone I have been using Crome for over years to update my balance on my credit card 
len ratingone Now my none of my information populates the screen 
len ratingone I just use Safari and had no problems my information 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed 
len ratingtwo With the latest upgrade I have noticed issue with font size 
len ratingtwo It gets really micro and one has to set it again 
len ratingtwo I hope this will be resolved in coming update as it is very annoying to change size of every website individually 
len ratingone I don t like that the search bar when you type it only shows half of the words 
len ratingone And some fonts are not readable 
len ratingone Its typed on another word 
len ratingone The layout of pages is a disaster 
len ratingone Lines are jumbling up on each other 
len ratingone I use large font and bold text through iOS settings and this latest version of chrome is not optimized for the adjusted font size 
len ratingone Pages are illegible buttons are overlaying other buttons so moving around is impossible 
len ratingone terrible
len ratingfour  The app functions better than the google app I previously downloaded which slows down as I attempt to open a browser 
len ratingone Google Chrome won t play YouTube videos in the background without YouTube Premium 
len ratingone Crashes all the time and frequently doesn t restore tabs 
len ratingone Awful 
len ratingfive  I beat my beat to hentai with incognito
len ratingone This was working great but suddenly everything looks huge 
len ratingone When I type something the font is so big that the full letters don t show as I type 
len ratingone This looks so ugly now 
len ratingthree App used to work great but all of a sudden the font has increased in size making it difficult to read search results in google 
len ratingthree Deleted the app and it fixed it but came back to the app later and again the text size auto increased and there is no clear way to change it 
len ratingfive  When I first I had my phone I used Safari the browser my iPhone had in the first place 
len ratingfive  I knew Chrome existed at that time But when I kept on using Safari I had a problem 
len ratingfive It was laggy and had ads which most likely led to viruses 
len ratingfive  I accidentally did that before 
len ratingfive Luckily it was a false 
len ratingfive I searched through the App Store and found Chrome 
len ratingfive Chrome saved my phone 
len ratingfive I am immediately in love with this app 
len ratingfive It is really easy to use and pretty much a secure browser 
len ratingfive I would reconsider on not using Safari and use Chrome instead 
len ratingfive I like it when I search up something on the app it has a lock 
len ratingfive And when it has an exclamation point it s most likely a sketchy website 
len ratingfive Overall Chrome is an easy secure browser app I consider downloading 
len ratingfive Chrome is one of those apps who have a bit of low ratings but when you try it yourself it s quite an amazing app 
len ratingfive I use Chrome over the OG Safari app 
len ratingfive  Thank You Google 
len ratingone annoying ad during usual use 
len ratingone Microsoft Edge is much better than Google Chrome
len ratingtwo I loved the app but then something happened and now everything is big like really zoomed in and I can t zoom out 
len ratingone I m so tired of trying to use the app my phone is updated and so it the application itself yet it keeps crashing and giving me webpage errors 
len ratingone I ve checked my WiFi my data and even closed all other apps and restarted the phone 
len ratingthree Chrome has been my main browser for yearsss 
len ratingthree As of lately it constantly crashes 
len ratingthree Everytime I close out of it to check on a different app when I open it back up I have to Restore my tabs 
len ratingthree But there have been multiple times when I open it up and it doesn t give me the option to restore 
len ratingthree I have to scroll and scroll and scroll through my history to try and find the pages I had open 
len ratingthree The first time it did it was when I had certain tabs up for a long time and it was impossible to find them again since the date I originally opened them were more than a week or two old 
len ratingthree Wish they would fix it 
len ratingthree An update late last year had this same kind of bug but I thought it had been fixed 
len ratingthree Pleaaase get this corrected 
len ratingthree I ikpujigcggbhdx
len ratingtwo  Only complain I really have is the experience on iPads and tablets 
len ratingtwo This app needs to align with the software being released 
len ratingtwo I can t edit a website on an iPad because it always thinks it s a phone 
len ratingtwo It s very restricting and frustrating I shouldn t have to pullout a computer ever time in need to edit a website 
len ratingtwo Please fix this
len ratingtwo It s kind of good and kind of bad 
len ratingone I am tired of google search showing results that are no longer relevant from years ago 
len ratingone Bye Google 
len ratingthree Until few days ago it kept crashing 
len ratingthree It was and still my fav browser but why is it crashing now 
len ratingthree After all these years 
len ratingfive I ve downloaded both Chrome and Google and chrome is way more user friendly than normal google
len ratingfive La mejor apps que he visto
len ratingfive NICE
len ratingone google tracking on steroids
len ratingtwo This is a mobile app 
len ratingtwo Most people hold their phones with one hand 
len ratingtwo Please bring back the G button that brought up the search bar and keyboard 
len ratingtwo We are so tired of having to hold the phone with hands 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingone I keep accidentally side swiping the page and it makes me go back 
len ratingone Why is that feature even a thing 
len ratingone If I wanted to go back a page I d click the back arrow 
len ratingfive I love c r o m e becouse 
len ratingfive When i need something its the ONLY thing i can use 
len ratingfive So yeah 
len ratingone I typically love Chrome but the new update has a few bugs 
len ratingone I cannot save pictures or copy and paste 
len ratingone Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingone Otherwise I will need to switch to Safari 
len ratingone Can t search anything due to having a VPN 
len ratingone Every page transition requires a captcha 
len ratingone Don t recommend 
len ratingone Don t use 
len ratingthree Great browser I can have all of bookmarks not just in my computer but on my phone although I feel is missing the dark mode option just like the Youtube has if they add that functionality it will look even better I m also tired of open facebook pages in the browser I expect chrome to open those links on the Facebook app if is installed does anyone knows how to do that
len ratingfive  Thanks
len ratingone Chrome browser was constantly rebooting so I updated to the latest version 
len ratingone Still reboots constantly 
len ratingone I m running iOS on two year old iPad 
len ratingtwo  I used to love Google but lately it crashes constantly making it impossible to read and educate myself on the coronavirus newsfront 
len ratingtwo Numerous websites crash 
len ratingtwo I have written feedback asking for this to be repaired but so far hey have done nothing constructive to stop this problem 
len ratingtwo I am positive that if I am having this problem that numerous others do too 
len ratingtwo How about it Google 
len ratingtwo Want to make our experiences better and make this the pleasant app it used to be 
len ratingone I ve switched to safari because of how the google search results do not allow you to easily copy and paste site urls and I can t zoom or move the pages horizontally 
len ratingtwo I cannot believe how poorly this app performs on a new iPad no less 
len ratingtwo Crashes constantly after a couple months of stable performance 
len ratingtwo No visibility into the problem whatsoever but I guess that s what I get for getting an iPad to appease the Apple fan people in my life 
len ratingtwo Chrome is a ubiquitous modern browser and reports of this kind of crash frequency are numerous 
len ratingtwo What the actual f 
len ratingone I switched to Microsoft Edge on my phone mac pc and I haven t looked back 
len ratingfive Good day
len ratingthree Google was really serving its purpose and letting me search things 
len ratingthree Like what it was meant to do 
len ratingthree Until I made a Gmail after I put in my password it said Looks like your account can go here and I don t know why my mom and I still can t find out why it s not working 
len ratingthree It works on safari but not Google 
len ratingthree Wow
len ratingtwo The latest update is horrible 
len ratingtwo Not all the websites work 
len ratingtwo Will have to use another search engine
len ratingtwo It should have google lens which can help us do well in image searching 
len ratingtwo The latest version of google chrome app on iOS has started to crash every time I switch to another application 
len ratingtwo This is really weird and disappointing as I expected chrome to be a stable web browser 
len ratingfive  Just noticed on my iPad once I favorite a page the star turns gray 
len ratingfive Not to nitpick but that confused me 
len ratingfive I have saved the page first on my desktop saw it later on my ipad 
len ratingfive Can you guys change the color so it stands out more and symbolizes it s been selected 
len ratingfive Versus a bland gray 
len ratingthree  I love the app but the pop up blocker doesn t seem to be working at all very annoying please allow extensions for chrome for iOS that would help tremendously
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingtwo Please get rid of or let me edit AMP links 
len ratingtwo They are awful and mess things up 
len ratingtwo And also when I load up a PDF it will crash chrome 
len ratingtwo Please fix these issues because I do like everything else about the app
len ratingone  Makes it free and makes money off of selling your data 
len ratingone Use DuckDuckGo instead to REBEL 
len ratingone  My butt is stinky I think you need to clean it 
len ratingfive I won a google nest mini thanks google
len ratingone  It is far to easy to get to stranger danger sites 
len ratingone There should be a built in safe search in the app 
len ratingone Simply the iOS chrome app continuously removes functionality from the user update by update 
len ratingone Most recently the option to Enable disable the new tab button in the bottom toolbar has been removed 
len ratingone When disabled the user is saved at least click when opening a new search in the same tab 
len ratingone It was a poor decision to remove the option to disable this feature 
len ratingone Export your passwords bookmarks and history to iOS and use safari until they focus on improving UX 
len ratingone The app consistently crashes within min of opening 
len ratingone Hope it gets resolved 
len ratingone Meanwhile looking for other app to use 
len ratingone  Corrupt media outlets are using left wing tech oligarchs to attack free speech 
len ratingtwo Deleted Google app 
len ratingtwo Company is on a downward spiral of censorship 
len ratingone Half pagesare invasive advertising and commercial video 
len ratingone It is annoying and unacceptable
len ratingone The app constantly throws Aw Snap errors when loading pages and periodically crashes entirely 
len ratingone I have tried every suggestion on the relevant Google Chrome Help page but these steps only result in minimal short term improvements 
len ratingone I have waited for a few updates to iOS and the Chrome app to see if the problem would be resolved but it appears to be getting worse rather than better 
len ratingone  Something is messed up with this AND search after the last updates because they close randomly after less than minutes of use 
len ratingone  I have used Google Chrome for years then I wondered I was agreeing to by clicking I have agreed to the terms of use and privacy policy 
len ratingone Google is a freaking stalker 
len ratingone Has ANYONE but me actually READ the privacy policy 
len ratingone They follow you everywhere with ads sell your information to the highest bidder and collect information on you on almost every website with their Google Tracking Network 
len ratingone And Google don t you dare tell me Google uses your information for a more personalized experience 
len ratingone We both know how a company famous for an entirely free service without the option to donate or upgrade account makes money 
len ratingone Oh and did you know the United States government is suing google for bn dollars because google tracks people 
len ratingone THAT S how bad it is 
len ratingtwo Be
len ratingfive I use this for all my searches 
len ratingfive I have gotten zero problems so far 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work google 
len ratingtwo I ve had a bunch of tabs open while I m researching a couple of issues 
len ratingtwo I just lost them all 
len ratingfive Be quiet ppl go download another web browser or use safari like Jesus
len ratingone Replaced with new tab button 
len ratingone Was much better with the search address bar button at the bottom of the screen
len ratingone  Jk just because
len ratingfive  I love chrome so much you can look up almost anything 
len ratingfive I think that it is so coooool 
len ratingfive  thank you so much for making it 
len ratingthree Love this app but my god the automatic switching to the regular tab after I close all the incognito tabs is so obnoxious 
len ratingthree I always have to leave at least one incognito tab open so it doesn t switch back 
len ratingthree I m begging y all to fix this 
len ratingfive  I love chrome so much you can look up almost anything 
len ratingfive I think that it is so coooool 
len ratingone Every time I try to google something it just tells me attacker s are tryna steal my data or I can t google cause of a problem or something
len ratingtwo  Nice web browser 
len ratingtwo The one big drawback of the browser is the Google voice search it doesn t give you enough time to talk before it searches 
len ratingtwo Why something so essential is looked over by the coders at alphabet 
len ratingtwo you guys need to think outside the box even more than you already do 
len ratingthree  For anyone who doesn t know images on a website can have hover text that is text that appears when the user hovers their mouse over the image 
len ratingthree Usually this hover text is just a URL for where the image is stored but developers can replace it with their own messages 
len ratingthree In mobile browsers such as this one this text is viewed by tapping and holding on the image 
len ratingthree In what I believe was the latest update this was changed so that it now shows only part of the hover text if it exceeds two lines 
len ratingthree That is if the hover text normally says Deep in the corner of my heart I suspect that real times tables are wrong about x and x all that appears will be Deep in some corner of my hea l times tables are wrong about x and x 
len ratingthree There is no way to see the full thing 
len ratingthree What this means is that if I m reading an xkcd comic and want to see the hover text my options are either a use VNC viewer to remotely access a raspberry pi I have in my basement and view the webpage on that or b use Safari tl dr text for tapping and holding on picture is shortened and shouldn t be please fix
len ratingone I normally keep tabs open 
len ratingone They all keep closing when I close the app
len ratingone It s ok sometimes it won t let me download it 
len ratingtwo I can t copy paste text on Chrome anymore that s very inconvenient for me 
len ratingone Just a common problem with Apple 
len ratingone I can t reinstall chrome on my gen iPad 
len ratingone Bad behavior was forcing me forward 
len ratingone Should never uninstall an app 
len ratingfour So I m writing this review not really to critique chrome at all but to bring up an issue I ve been having 
len ratingfour I do like chrome and have been using it longer than I can remember 
len ratingfour For some reason tho I ve noticed that when I open my browser the page that i was on last is in black and white for a few seconds and sometimes a page will freeze completely and I ll have to close the page and open a new one 
len ratingfour I am using a newer iPhone so I don t think that s the issue 
len ratingfour I just want to make this issue known 
len ratingone  DO NOT PUT A PERIOD BUTTON IN THE SPOT NEXT TO KEYBOARD 
len ratingone I KEEP HITTING WHILE TRYING TO TYPE SOMETHING IN SO INSTEAD OF SPACES THERE ARE PERIODS 
len ratingone Ugh this keyboard is absolutely bogus 
len ratingone Why do I need a period 
len ratingone Put the period in the space with the other necessary symbols it causes so much delay 
len ratingone And it s garbage 
len ratingthree Had a wide array of CMD lt key gt functions on iPad that worked 
len ratingthree Now I initially get functions but when I use one like CMD W only three show up as working 
len ratingtwo Works much the same way like Safari but at least let s you sync your google account 
len ratingtwo Looks clunky don t like it
len ratingtwo Back button easy standard feature doesn t work 
len ratingfive Chrome is just so good that I want to keep this app on my iPad
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone Why does chrome not act like real desktop chrome where we can have users 
len ratingthree oop 
len ratingone The subject says it all 
len ratingone Safari acknowledges I have a password manager 
len ratingone Chrome only seems to figure it out after I ve already retrieved the password for a given site 
len ratingone It s really frustrating and I accidentally open new tabs because of the new tab button I m deleting the app 
len ratingone  Ra ra ha ha ha runa rahahaha ra ra ra haha runiningrun
len ratingone  DO IT
len ratingfive Moseka Mimpiya
len ratingone For the last few weeks Chrome has locked up dozens of times on my IPhone 
len ratingone I ve used it for years without an issue 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingfive So what you do is easy you delete chrome and download it again
len ratingtwo Updated yesterday now doesn t work on my phone
len ratingfive I sevan I lik us e thiss app for neked girls cuz it haz secret mod
len ratingthree When i scroll down a random website it would keep going upwards automatically making it impossible for me to read the rest of the article 
len ratingthree This often happens with a site filled with ads 
len ratingthree I thought the new update might fix it but uh uh 
len ratingtwo I love chrome but the latest update replaced the search bar at the bottom with a new tab button and it s the worst 
len ratingtwo Bring back the search at the bottom 
len ratingone I used it to change my channel banner add thumbnails video cat gories and channel layout 
len ratingone After I updated it it just sends me back to youtube 
len ratingone Also for privacy reasons because google may have been stalking me watching my every fricking move I will uninstall this 
len ratingone If you people actually do stalk me karma exists 
len ratingone it crashes too often
len ratingfour Better tab experience than Safari since I don t have to be at the bottom of a page to switch tabs 
len ratingfour Aside from that Chrome can be a battery drainer and make the back of the phone hot from time to time 
len ratingfour Nice job keep up the improvements 
len ratingfive I love this app it s amazing 
len ratingthree I use chrome on everything 
len ratingthree However on my iPhone the app crashes but more importantly it just randomly closes all my open tabs 
len ratingthree I keep certain pages open so I can go back to quickly and many many times I open chrome to a blank slate pages gone 
len ratingthree WTH 
len ratingone  I have used Google Chrome for years then I wondered I was agreeing to by clicking I have agreed to the terms of use and privacy policy 
len ratingone Google is a freaking stalker 
len ratingone Has ANYONE but me actually READ the privacy policy 
len ratingone They follow you everywhere with ads sell your information to the highest bidder and collect information on you on almost every website with their Google Tracking Network 
len ratingone And Google don t you dare tell me Google uses your information for a more personalized experience 
len ratingone We both know how a company famous for an entirely free service without the option to donate or upgrade account makes money 
len ratingone Oh and did you know the Canadian government is suing google for tracking people 
len ratingone THAT S how bad it is 
len ratingone Bring back the Search G button instead of New Tab or at least bring the flag back 
len ratingone Google killed one handed browsing with this update 
len ratingone If you are going to make a major change to an app people have been using for ages at least give us the option to change it back 
len ratingone I can update this review once you fix the app 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive Excelente aplicaci n muy buena
len ratingfive  It helps me play roblox
len ratingfive  J aime Google chrome
len ratingthree I recently switched from Android and it seems that Chrome works better on a Google phone than iPhone 
len ratingthree Is this intentionally done 
len ratingone My chrome is not letting loan nothing at the moment
len ratingfive Dg
len ratingone Ya
len ratingfive  The only things I search on here is naked girls kissing people
len ratingone Allows redirection as well
len ratingone  So useless
len ratingtwo  Chrome has a major glitch 
len ratingtwo Anytime I attempt to zoom into a website Chrome completely errors out with Aw snap and the entire website is gone and must be reloaded 
len ratingtwo This has been happening for weeks now and happens every time I try to zoom in 
len ratingone All of us use Google primarily for their search 
len ratingone The search button in the bottom of the chrome browser was a genius 
len ratingone A few versions of Chrome ago that button was removed from default settings 
len ratingone We had to go to chrome flags and enable it 
len ratingone Now with the latest version we can not even do that 
len ratingone  Prior to last update the button on the bottom toolbar on a new or existing tab would bring up the URL bar so that the user could enter in a search or a website 
len ratingone This was a great convenience for kicking off a new search without wasting the time opening a new tab or once opening a new tab being able to easily search or type a URL without having to select the search bar 
len ratingone But the latest change is to have a button instead so that a new tab opens up 
len ratingone This isn t the worst when on an existing tab although somewhat wasteful since I have to go back and close the old one but it s a nightmare on new tabs 
len ratingone Because it keeps opening new tabs 
len ratingone Why would this be the button behavior on a new tab 
len ratingone In what situation does a user think Hey I just opened this new tab 
len ratingone You know what I really want to do as my next action 
len ratingone Open another new tab Ya ll were running this as an experiment for a while and I had to track it down and disable it 
len ratingone This decision to roll it out feels like the result of a product manager looking at new tab metrics seeing them go up from their toolbar new tab button experiment and then patting themselves on the back for such a brilliant test 
len ratingone You guys need to talk to actual humans about this stuff or at least look at a more useful cross section of metrics when making a decision to roll out an experiment like this 
len ratingfive Greaaaaat
len ratingthree  So I just updated the app but it won t let me in chrome now I would just see the main page and then it will kick me out of the app
len ratingone As is the case with all Google software quality is horrible and Chrome is no different 
len ratingone Watch all your tabs disappear all at once regularly while using this browser 
len ratingone It s a complete show stopper bug making the browser virtually unusable 
len ratingone If you like a single tabbed browse then this one is for you 
len ratingfive  Appreciate a lot for providing a comprehensive and extensive range of Amazing apps to live with 
len ratingfour The app works great but lately every time I open the app it appears to be black and white and then it loads to color 
len ratingfour For a second this made me think I was color blind 
len ratingthree  Not having a dark mode for chrome Is a big bummer especially since Gmail and other google apps have it would be nice to search google while using a dark mode hopefully they will update
len ratingone  star cuz yes
len ratingfive  It s great
len ratingone I DONT CARE WHO DID THIS BUT BRING BACK JIN 
len ratingone BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE MANY REASON MANY YOUNG GIRLS LOVE THEMSELVES AGAIN 
len ratingone Idk if u did this but just bring him back I think I lost a little of myself today 
len ratingone Thank you for your time
len ratingone Why did you guys remove Jin 
len ratingone Why does it say members of BTS 
len ratingone This is really stupid 
len ratingone Did you guys really change it because some toxic people payed you to do it 
len ratingfive I know I know 
len ratingfive I like roblox and you can t get in to a game on roblox from phone on google but ever since I switched from Microsoft Edge on my iPhone to google 
len ratingfive It has changed like and what I mean by that is better than Microsoft Edge 
len ratingfive I loved Microsoft edge 
len ratingfive But when I switched I was like lol what i am saying is that you all should get Google Chrome 
len ratingfive  btw i have a google hub in my room 
len ratingone I GIVE STAR BECAUSE ON WINDOWS TEN THE ADD BUTTON GOT REMOVED ON FLASH SETTINGS PLEASE ADD OT AGAIN OR I WILL KEEP ONE STAR
len ratingone PUT JIN BACK ON GOOGLE 
len ratingone IDC IF YOU WANT THAT MONEY PUT HIS PICTURE BACK ON 
len ratingfive Dhiehwhihfeilhioehouh
len ratingone Jin tf back Jin tf back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back Jin back
len ratingfive  I love chrome so much you can look up almost anything 
len ratingtwo The update at the end of May ate my tabs 
len ratingtwo I used to be able to maintain all of my regular sites up all the time through multiple tabs 
len ratingtwo I could close Chrome and it would remember the tabs I had open 
len ratingtwo Now they disappear when the app crashes 
len ratingone  DO NOT PUT A PERIOD BUTTON IN THE SPOT NEXT TO KEYBOARD 
len ratingone I KEEP HITTING WHILE TRYING TO TYPE SOMETHING IN SO INSTEAD OF SPACES THERE ARE PERIODS 
len ratingfour Everything was great until I realized I can t use an extension on chrome for my business from my iPad 
len ratingone  Don t use chrome until a patch or update is released 
len ratingone It crashes continuously on certain webpages and its not worth being frustrated over it 
len ratingone Wait until you read that it s fixed before using for now 
len ratingone I understand if this is a mistake but me as an army I am very offended by this How come whenever I search up how many members are in BTS it says at least The worst part is jins photo isn t there even though the other members photos are Out of all the things that are happening right now you re going to do this and make us army which are MILLIONS angry Don t expect this to come without a price because is army will find a way to help Jin get his rights back no matter what 
len ratingone  deci ce pula mea se intampla unde draq e jin 
len ratingone ba sa vezi ce pumn i fut unde pzd matii i jinutz 
len ratingone repede iai pus poza la loc si informatiile despre el altfel fac ditamai scandalu pidaraz ce esti 
len ratingone pidaraz 
len ratingone ba sa fi fost tu om iti futeam una de mureai 
len ratingone repede pana maine jinutz a meu sa fie la loc daca tu ai sa vezi ce draq iti fac ba pula de chroome 
len ratingtwo I ve been using chrome on my iPad since I got it and just within this week I ve had my chrome crash and lose all my tabs some of which had important information I cannot recover 
len ratingtwo as of today chrome kept constantly freezing on me and when I would exit out I would lose all tabs 
len ratingtwo this is really upsetting because chrome is my main browser on all my devices and I have many of my passwords synced to chrome and cannot access the sites that I need to for both doing work and doing schoolwork on my iPad
len ratingthree I normally enjoy using chrome on my iPhone but recently discover won t load no matter what I try 
len ratingthree Please look into this issue 
len ratingthree I rarely have had issues with chrome in the ten years I ve been using it but it crashed twice in a row today and I lost more than tabs I had open of various important things 
len ratingthree It never gave me the option to restore them the second time and it s not in my browsing history either 
len ratingthree I ve had a few of these open for years so I m pretty upset 
len ratingthree I lost a ton of unrecoverable data for my wedding as well as my business 
len ratingone  We want update for Google authenticator Please look to review for the people on this app please we want app lock Touch or Face ID and we want backup on iCloud Drive Like Microsoft Authenticator 
len ratingone Please please please google company 
len ratingone This app is awful 
len ratingone It errors often oh snap and crashes pretty consistently losing every open tab 
len ratingone I have syncing on but it rarely actually syncs 
len ratingone Unlike Firefox you can t manually sync 
len ratingone  That I can find 
len ratingone I m so tired of chrome and google s stuff is proprietary enough that you can t choose other default browsers 
len ratingone I just lost another some tabs today 
len ratingone Chrome let me restore them after the first crash then proceeded to crash again 
len ratingone I reopened chrome saw it sync it crashed again and when I tried to recover recent tabs there was nothing because it synced right after it crashed 
len ratingone Too frustrating to depend on 
len ratingone I looked on my pc s browser and it showed no synced tabs from my iPad 
len ratingone This has been going on for over years with no improvement 
len ratingone Bookmark all open tabs regularly or you ll be screwed 
len ratingtwo Considering app usage on an iPad solely Chrome would function much better if the application would allow for split screening to take place within the same browser as it does enable on desktops 
len ratingfive I m not trying to say it s bad but when I put it reload a times maybe you can fix it I hat it
len ratingtwo The ability to disable this flag was convenient as I really enjoyed having the search button on the bottom bar but now there is no option for it 
len ratingtwo The search button at the bottom of the app has been removed 
len ratingtwo This is really unergonomic and awful 
len ratingtwo Give us the option to change it back 
len ratingtwo  Trouble displaying multiple tabs without constant random reloads 
len ratingtwo Does not work with apple keyboard 
len ratingtwo The CEOs baby destroyed 
len ratingtwo It has so much potential to dominate 
len ratingtwo But not saving your tabs not showing them on your desktop browser crashing constantly and rarely recovering and absolutely zero support are a damning combination 
len ratingtwo  Hi Thanks for reaching out 
len ratingtwo Try the steps to solve crashes issues in this Help Center article 
len ratingtwo If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingtwo Worse then normal app
len ratingtwo I originally switched to chrome on my phone to sync with PC and because the search button was at the bottom of the screen 
len ratingtwo Even with large hands reaching the top of the screen to search is uncomfortable 
len ratingtwo The phones keep getting bigger why would the most used function be at the top of the screen 
len ratingtwo Especially on a browser who s primary revenue is from search 
len ratingtwo Can we at least have an option in settings to switch it back 
len ratingtwo It was perfect before 
len ratingthree i mean it was okay but i had a other search an i didnt use it much anyway an i wanted a new app so ima give it three stars
len ratingthree I normally love Chrome but not on IPad 
len ratingthree Pages load slow and just seems too buggy 
len ratingthree Passwords also don t register all the time 
len ratingthree Very disappointed 
len ratingfive This is a good app
len ratingfive It s decent
len ratingone It s not loading 
len ratingtwo  Chrome never shuts down properly and it always deletes all my important tabs 
len ratingfive I move it follow my Instagram miyaaplays
len ratingone  The chrome app for iOS is absolute trash 
len ratingone It crashes consistently and wipes out all of my tabs so frequently that I ve given up on it as my default browser 
len ratingone It s even more disappointing because I have a Windows computer and it would be GREAT to be able to use across my phone and laptop if it worked as it should 
len ratingone One star because I have to give it at least one 
len ratingfive Very good web browser deserves stars
len ratingtwo Seems like everything is much bigger in Chrome over Safari 
len ratingtwo Can t Zoom out 
len ratingtwo Don t have the account manipulative abilities like the Desktop Chrome has 
len ratingtwo Just bring most of if not all the Chrome functionality the desktop browser has to the iPad app 
len ratingtwo Stupid website I hate this Google LLC fix this NOW or I will uninstall it
len ratingtwo Works OK but there are much better options available both for speed and privacy 
len ratingtwo Everyone knows Google mines people s data and browsing history to make money which is a privacy issue and all the ads slow things down 
len ratingtwo Brave browser uses same code base as Chrome both use Chromium but filters out ads which makes browsing faster and more private 
len ratingtwo Same thing with Firefox as long as you change default search engine to be startpage com or duckduckgo com 
len ratingone In the latest update the Request desktop site function is completely gone 
len ratingone I don t understand why they d remove this 
len ratingone It s and that s one of the essential features of any mobile browser 
len ratingone I m uninstalling 
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingthree Chrome is great but when I search stuff sometimes to wont work do you know why 
len ratingfour I have switched to using my iPad as my main computer for College now that there is good mouse and keyboard support with iOS 
len ratingfour I have always loved the Chrome browser but one thing is missing on the iOS app 
len ratingfour There is no way to see the bookmarks bar without going through a journey through the menus 
len ratingfour The point of a book mark is for easy of access and with the app it is faster to type the URL in then to go and find the book mark 
len ratingfive  Thank y all for the update
len ratingfive It needs DevTools Web Inspector
len ratingtwo  They put the translation button on top of the screen so it covers all the menu buttons on most website pages 
len ratingtwo Who is coming up with these ridiculous designs a newbie tech 
len ratingtwo Google is no longer innovative it s just laughable 
len ratingone Amazing the name Google has become synonymous with crashing for me now 
len ratingone Searching for images 
len ratingone Enjoy unexpected crashes freezes and gifs not playing in search results 
len ratingone Is there a glitch in the last update that causes my suggested articles not to update 
len ratingone How do I fix that feature 
len ratingthree It s chrome 
len ratingthree Works great overall but the suggested articles on the home page doesn t work for me anymore 
len ratingthree Kind of a bummer since I enjoy new articles like that 
len ratingone  how can you screw up something as basic as bookmarks 
len ratingone folders are all over the place for no reason 
len ratingone you just have to bookmark to the bar and then use an actual computer to organize them 
len ratingfive  Por alg n motivo dejo de aparecer las noticias 
len ratingfive Me hacen mucha falta
len ratingthree Worked fine until I updated it today and now it crashes when I open it 
len ratingthree How do you manage to break something not broken 
len ratingthree Suggested articles not updating 
len ratingthree I love this feature and it s now broken 
len ratingthree All the suggested articles stopped after a recent update 
len ratingthree Google support fixes suggestions did not resolve the issue 
len ratingone  Same bug unable to use keyboard shortcut to switch between tabs with smart keyboard iPad Pro inch 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone Every time I close the app all of my tabs get erased it s a nightmare 
len ratingone In a recent update chrome changed the center bottom button from a search button to a new tab button 
len ratingone This UX change makes zero sense to me now I have to reach to the top of the screen to change the url or search anything 
len ratingone Who needs to get new tabs quickly 
len ratingone Please bring back the search button I do not understand the point of this new change 
len ratingtwo chrome crashed and i lost all of my tabs multiple times with no way to recover them
len ratingone I am a big fan of google products but this time I fee that the company is using unethical means for improving tiktok ratings 
len ratingone They are sidelining user sentiments and decided to delete the reviews to improve the rating 
len ratingone It breaks my heart seeing google dropping down to this level 
len ratingone I will try to use google less and less 
len ratingone Even my friends who work at google are ashamed of this decision 
len ratingone  This update affected keyboard shortcuts on the iPad Pro smart keyboard 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone  Somehow I am in the wrong group 
len ratingone A serious mistake has been made because 
len ratingone I am not a developer nor do I want to learn how to code 
len ratingone Please call me at Thank you in advance Lyda Bonds I do not even have a nick named
len ratingfive But i am not able to watch videos even when I update the app
len ratingthree I can t ready anything without holding my phone an inch from my face 
len ratingthree The previous version was perfect in terms of readability 
len ratingthree The new tab structure makes sense and I m not used to it but I m sure I ll come around 
len ratingthree The font pisses me off and if I weren t already indoctrinated after years of use I might have just stopped web browsing all together 
len ratingthree Need to get all the audio and video recording up to date with new IOS 
len ratingthree Defeats the purpose of why I bought my iPad that I cannot use for school now 
len ratingthree There is no sound for the BONGO program for seminars 
len ratingfour  Eerily quiet amp I
len ratingone Avery time I watched a video ADDS ADDS ADDS
len ratingthree  I really hate the tab view its really annoying even closing tabs is a pain why do I have to go all the way to the X to close a tab instead of swiping to close it the tab layout just dose not look good please update 
len ratingthree  iPhone SE 
len ratingone Chrome is so useful but some problems happen and you fix it but then Ooops looks like you have spread it i wonder why this happens Once I was on chrome searching something but then I got a problem and I reloaded the page and it was all gone and my friend who was close to me was on chrome too she had no problem until I reloaded the page The problem spread to my Mom Dad and everyone who was close so be careful 
len ratingfive This is epic
len ratingone Stupid old fashioned and to confusing 
len ratingtwo  out of I like it cuz I do not like google
len ratingone Doses not save private browsing information
len ratingfour Yeye skirt skirt
len ratingone I have never been able to use Chase 
len ratingone I had to download Chrome I don t know why 
len ratingone So I downloaded it and still can t use Chase 
len ratingone Why does it have to be so frustrating 
len ratingone I just want the balance in my Chase card and why you took payments out of my bank account 
len ratingfour It keeps saying articles aren t available right now
len ratingone Just started in the last few days
len ratingfive BAD
len ratingone  SPYWARE WARNING 
len ratingone Please put the Google search button back on the bottom 
len ratingone  Unfair to support terrorist and support thief s land with kill everybody live on
len ratingthree I really liked this browser on the Iphone 
len ratingthree It lets you move pages around in whatever order you like and will even start putting new pages into order for you 
len ratingthree Unfortunately I had to stop using the app because every now and again it will dump your pages unless you press the restore button on the opening screen 
len ratingthree If you fail to notice it in time your pages will be lost and I can t afford to have that happen again so I m out 
len ratingthree So chromes good I love it but it saved a random weird website on my iPad I was using a free movie website and then I got a pop up link and I accidentally clicked it and it closed it fast but still the link always shows up when I type www 
len ratingthree Is there I was I can make it go away the website is weird and it makes me uncomfortable to see it so yeah
len ratingfour It s good but kinda slow 
len ratingthree I would prefer it over the safari browser on my iPad if All commands could be listed by pressing and holding the command button 
len ratingthree Currently there are only keyboard shortcuts on the list in contrast to Safari s shortcuts The inclusion of more commands keyboard shortcuts such as close tab find on page etc 
len ratingthree  Maybe some extensions
len ratingfive I wanted a sec safari and now there is 
len ratingfive Thanks so much
len ratingone  I love Chrome but I just lost over tabs for absolutely no reason 
len ratingone The app didn t crash I didn t click close all tabs nothing 
len ratingone And there is NO WAY TO GET MY TABS BACK 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY 
len ratingone I am very disappointed in Google right now 
len ratingone the app freezes when i open a pdf and start scrolling it messes up my phone too my phone freezes too 
len ratingone I would normally give this a five star rating However after updating the app I tried to open it but it s saying that This app is not Shared to me anymore buy it in the App Store 
len ratingone However when I click view in app store there s nothing saying I need to buy it it simply shows a blue button that says open but it won t open 
len ratingone I even have a Gmail I had no problems with it until I recently updated the app 
len ratingone PLEASE fix this because I d love to give it five stars again it s my main way of looking stuff up online on my iPad amp iPhone 
len ratingone Run by an awful corporation the doesn t care about what people think 
len ratingone It removes honest reviews from terrible and evil apps
len ratingone They started deleting bad reviews for Tik tok and this review is here to say we don t do that here in the United States of America without return fire 
len ratingone Stop putting ads on YouTube
len ratingone I love Chrome 
len ratingone I use it for my class work browsing the web and more 
len ratingone But One day I came and all my tabs were gone 
len ratingone Please tell me what happen 
len ratingthree  DO IT
len ratingfive The newest update has a bug where the recommendations don t show up even when you tap on more 
len ratingfive Plz fix 
len ratingtwo There is no option to save to files You d think Google Drive would somehow be integrated when you pull up a pdf but no 
len ratingtwo I have to copy and paste the url to Safari and download it there 
len ratingtwo Very disappointing 
len ratingtwo And PLEASE do something about the ads 
len ratingtwo At least with safari we could download content blockers 
len ratingone  This will slow down your phone a lot 
len ratingone Use FireFox or Opera instead of you don t like Safari 
len ratingfive I think this app is very very good but there is one thing that I think would be very cool and that is the feature to customize the screen like at least a few cool backgrounds would make the app even better 
len ratingone This is great to have on my phone but you really shouldn t delete bad tik tok reviews and really should delete the good ones because it is a terrible thing and will never be as great as vine
len ratingone Ya shouldn t have deleted our reviews
len ratingone Until a few days ago I used Chrome daily 
len ratingone Now when I try to open it on my iPad Pro it will not open 
len ratingone It say I have to purchase it from the App Store 
len ratingone I deleted it and re installed it same result 
len ratingone  This version is awful it s slow like a turtle
len ratingfive So much better than safari unlike safari the cloud access to passwords is way more accessible but still secure 
len ratingfive I also thought there was an all out dark mode but I m not sure if it s been removed or relocated 
len ratingfive Still 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive Fast 
len ratingfive Accessible 
len ratingone Since new update I can t open browser 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingone This is my favorite browser 
len ratingone Now that they have taken away the google search button which activated the search bar and disabling the chrome flags to re enable it and replaced it with the new tab button I have no reason to continue using it 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and switched back to safari now 
len ratingthree this app is terrible but i can make it look like it s educational purposes and browse the web 
len ratingthree since this app is a good decoy i ll give it a shaky stars 
len ratingthree I use chrome for everything 
len ratingthree I absolutely adore it 
len ratingthree But for some reason after I updated it I cannot open it anymore 
len ratingthree I m scared to delete it because I would loose ALL of my open tabs and I really don t want to risk it 
len ratingthree I m really confused and I hope something fixes it 
len ratingfive Cool what we do without chrome and App Store ugh I am in zoom meeting bye
len ratingtwo After the update if I try to open the app it immediately closes then gives me a pop up warning saying this app is no longer shared with you you must purchase it in the App Store 
len ratingtwo I have never shared this app so it makes no sense 
len ratingtwo I go the App Store and my only option is Open 
len ratingtwo If I do the open from there still does not work 
len ratingfive I tend to use google chrome to read numerous articles on the daily 
len ratingfive However sometimes I have trouble reading them because website clutter gets in the way 
len ratingfive The one feature that would make this perfect is if google chrome could have a reader mode just like everyone else 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingone The app quit working after this latest update 
len ratingone It tells me I need to buy it in the App Store 
len ratingone When I go to the App Store I have the choice to open and when I do it closes 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone Or you will face the wrath of reddit
len ratingone This is the worse browser ever that I used 
len ratingone Nothing ever works and It is very slow 
len ratingone Google do us a favor and end chrome and actually develop an web browser that works 
len ratingone Updated to newest patch and Chrome wouldn t even load 
len ratingtwo I ve been using this app for a while 
len ratingtwo Now it s saying that it s no longer shared with me 
len ratingtwo I need this app back
len ratingone After this latest update I can t even open the app 
len ratingone It tells me it s no longer shared with me 
len ratingtwo It still works on some pages but pulling down to close or refresh a site is now broken for about of my web browsing
len ratingthree I have restriction mode on but i can still see nstw when i go on images please fix this
len ratingone Won t let me watch videos black screen
len ratingfive good
len ratingthree  I only did this so I could have google in dark mode v 
len ratingfive They are efficient trustworthy and reliable not to mention fair pricing Thank You guys Nancy C Drysdale
len ratingfive When you try and watch a youtube video in desktop veiw with the phone in landscape mode it forces you to contstanly scroll down when you click on a video untill u go back to portrait mode
len ratingfour I use this every day it s like a computer 
len ratingfour But for example on Flipgrid I can t record anything I have to download the app 
len ratingfour Which is ok I just thought I would be able to record on there 
len ratingfour And there is other things 
len ratingfour But remember I still love it 
len ratingone  It s really frustrating and I open accidentally new tab because of the new tab I m gonna delete the app 
len ratingone  I ve been needing to record a video for my school and I need to have google chrome to do so 
len ratingone I downloaded logged in overall spent over minutes working on getting it to open 
len ratingone When I thought the struggle was over it said error reload 
len ratingone I reloaded countless times and the same message was replayed 
len ratingone I love google chrome as a search engine when it loads but if you don t want something that crashes creates inappropriate adds and is absolutely impossible to use than google chrome is not for you 
len ratingone Please fix this problem 
len ratingthree  Chrome os good overall but needs the ability to download like safari
len ratingone More and more Google has no interest in privacy of the individual believing companies have rights like people do 
len ratingone What a farce 
len ratingfive Perfect for the skeet amp sleep 
len ratingfive  thanks
len ratingone This app and apple are no longer allowing legacy devices to install older versions of applications 
len ratingone Let us download older releases 
len ratingfour I like using the app for school but when close the app the and open it up later the tabs show a black screen and I don t really like how it does that because before it showed the tabs when closing the app please fix it Google
len ratingfive sent
len ratingfive Google is amazing so good I just can t use words
len ratingfive This is the best 
len ratingone As the title states the app glitched my phone and I got stuck with a completely black screen for an entire day until the battery finally died 
len ratingone There s no excuse for a bug like that AVOID THIS APP 
len ratingfive your beast ceb god
len ratingone  I expected to find something resembling the desktop version of Chrome 
len ratingone What I found is a shamefully cutdown version of Chrome 
len ratingone Lacks settings available on the desktop version 
len ratingone Can t even choose a homepage 
len ratingone Or have a bookmark bar 
len ratingone If you like a featureless no bones browser you found it 
len ratingone I think an iPad Pro generation is quite capable of running the desktop version 
len ratingone Even a th generation iPad is 
len ratingone Because my year old iMac certainly has no problems 
len ratingone Is and still no reader mode available
len ratingfive I Have No Complains
len ratingone  I don t like Crome
len ratingone Way to slow
len ratingfour  I don t want to show my location to google or any advertisers by any place i went to or living it s violate privacy
len ratingone  I love chrome on pc and iphone 
len ratingone But whenever I go to copy a link and realize I m actually looking at some AMP thing it makes me want to cut down a tree and drive my car into the pointy end going mph 
len ratingone It s absurd google thinks their customers don t notice that AMP stinks just so they can harvest more of our data 
len ratingone Peace 
len ratingfive Chrome has been working amazing compared to safari on my ipad 
len ratingfive Its so fast and it seems nice 
len ratingfive I reccomend for better tabs too 
len ratingone I love the connectivity between devices but it s crashing so much it s become unusable 
len ratingfive It s is really good and super fast
len ratingtwo Chrome is crashing quite frequently since last update
len ratingthree I hate how lately it is closing all of my tabs but I am unable to open them again which is an inconvenience due to how often I search for things and leave other tabs open to view read later 
len ratingone Absolute trash 
len ratingone the entire search engine goes off of what media wants people to see 
len ratingone it never shows true results 
len ratingone you look up adrenochrome on google and nothing significant pops up 
len ratingone if you search it on other sites you can see how the elites have been abusing children and killing them for a jump in adrenaline to give them a high 
len ratingone google has a hold on society and it keeps people from knowing the truth
len ratingone Useless without a bookmarks bar 
len ratingone I usually have multiple tabs open on this app 
len ratingone Usually around 
len ratingone For some reason when I open new tabs The app crashes and my phone completely freezes 
len ratingone This app was running perfectly fine with over tabs open just a few months ago so why can t it work with now 
len ratingfive Hands down the number one browser and the search engine out there 
len ratingtwo The ads are awful and there isn t an ad blocker extension available yet 
len ratingtwo If you hate ads that block content you d be better off downloading Firefox or using safari with an ad blocker 
len ratingtwo In the past I used chrome religiously and would even advocate for it now it s not worth it 
len ratingtwo I need chrome to work to synchronize across devices 
len ratingtwo However I can t even read the news anymore as pages don t load or display oops messages 
len ratingtwo So frustrating 
len ratingtwo Chrome is great but the mobile app is not rvery user friendly 
len ratingtwo They replaced the middle search button for a new tab button and it is annoying to reach the top search bar 
len ratingtwo The incognito mode is the same as we have to go all the way up to be able to search for something 
len ratingtwo They way they arrange their tabs and how to delete them is also a big mess where you have to move your finger all around unlike safari where you can just scroll between the tabs 
len ratingone At first I thought my phone was the problem until I talked a few of my friends on Facebook 
len ratingone I don t know which update or updates caused these problems 
len ratingone My screen can t be used in different places at different times when I open tabs it will freeze my phone and sometimes it won t unfreeze even when I shut it down if I m even able at times 
len ratingone Sometimes I have to remove the battery 
len ratingone Another is when I go to a site and the screen goes completely black usually followed by locking up 
len ratingone I search a site and it acts like it s going to it then the tab closes and I have to start over 
len ratingone And before you ask I checked and I m not set to restricted 
len ratingone There s even more and now a lot of folks are talking about it on Facebook and recommending other search engines 
len ratingone I liked google chrome prior to this
len ratingone History won t clear so I deleted app 
len ratingone Every time I try to open this app on my iPad it crashes 
len ratingone I have reset my iPad and it still crashes 
len ratingone Everytime I start up Google Chrome and type something into the search bar and press enter it always resets the tab right after and I have to retype what I was searching for and Chrome doesn t even remember what I just searched like I didn t just type it in the search bar and press enter 
len ratingone This is getting repetitive it s been doing this for months I m not going to change my rating until you fix it 
len ratingone  Not gonna lie big brain
len ratingone  Repeated crashing on iPad 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingone It is the worst App eve create In man history
len ratingone On this app it has many errors they I wish got removed from the app use 
len ratingone That the app if you open a document it takes you to docs same for forms and slides 
len ratingone I also hope that this Change is added also this a app same with docs and slides is a app that doesn t require WiFi At ALL 
len ratingone This app was good yet now for home learning I dislike it 
len ratingone I know you might think this is just a bad review to get it off the app yet no 
len ratingone I mean every thing I stated and those are just a few reasons 
len ratingone  me
len ratingone As I load some thing it would take long and it will give me the reason why but my WiFi is fine so I can t do anything about it 
len ratingfive No question about it this app is so easy to use amp work with I love it
len ratingone  Things that chrome doesn t have 
len ratingone Ad block 
len ratingone Privacy settings 
len ratingone Home page displaying bookmarks 
len ratingone Chrome extensions Google keeping abuse it s dominance in the browser market and refuse further improvement 
len ratingone I d more than happy to pay for the google service I m using and we should have the option to do so 
len ratingone Sucking invasion of privacy 
len ratingfive I could watch my anime very good on this and other stuff i don t really have much to say but its fantastic
len ratingfive It s great for porn
len ratingone Chrome and Google are doing everything to run their empire 
len ratingone I hate to be a data source in their stockpile 
len ratingone It is completely sneaky the way they steal our data 
len ratingone The title says it stupid friggin crashes 
len ratingone I am just trying to use scratch 
len ratingone And you keep crashing 
len ratingone So it is bull crap 
len ratingtwo Wsswtedsrrrrwrrrwssdwrwswswswwswsswsss we
len ratingone Everybody poop or Chrome will die
len ratingfive The Gino game is the best
len ratingfive I m very ugly
len ratingthree I wish this app was better because I need it for things related to school however it really annoys me that it requires me to download five different apps instead of just letting me use the website 
len ratingthree Safari lets me use google meets without downloading the app which got like two stars by the way 
len ratingthree Google chrome does not 
len ratingthree It s a real shame because it s forcing me to download crappy apps just so I can do my schoolwork 
len ratingthree Thanks a lot 
len ratingone Chrome crashes often on iPhone why 
len ratingone Pixel Samsung and iPad work fine but my iPhone it crashes often and deletes all my web pages 
len ratingone  Been crashing last days on iPhone iOS 
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingone Slow app that frequently crashes 
len ratingone Don t bother
len ratingfive Woo hoo yeah
len ratingfour I really like Chrome and how it seamlessly syncs with my other devices 
len ratingfour My only issue is with the app on my iPad 
len ratingfour When I open a new tab I wish the cursor would automatically be placed in the search bar 
len ratingfour I can t tell you how many times I ve clicked a new tab and started typing only to realize that none of it was being translated on the screen 
len ratingone No privacy 
len ratingone Switch to another browser bc taking down articles you don t agree with is not freedom of speech 
len ratingfive Omg soo nice
len ratingone ITS SO BAD IT WONT LET ME DOWNLOAD IT
len ratingtwo It s very slow to freezing and crashes so often 
len ratingfive I absolutley love this app and the interface it has but the one problem it has is that it doesnt supporrt flash so any website that needs flash you cant use on this app 
len ratingfive Another thing that the developers could do is being able to customize the interface on the mac and laptop versions you are able to customize but you are not going to be able to on this app 
len ratingfive Developers please notice me
len ratingfive  No more
len ratingfour It is good but I want to mute the site I can t
len ratingfive I been using this for years and I like it on my ipad
len ratingtwo I mostly use chrome on pc and it is x faster than how it is on mobile 
len ratingtwo On mobile it mostly takes seconds to a minute for a page to show up after I search up something so a technique i do is I open a new tab for the current tab I just used to load up faster 
len ratingtwo On safari it only takes seconds to load a page 
len ratingfive  But this still works The best 
len ratingfive I tried Firefox hard to understand amp Safari not able to use on much expect my phone 
len ratingfive I still believe chrome is still the best 
len ratingtwo I hate that you removed tap to search button from the bottom center of the screen 
len ratingone I stopped using Google Chrome until you provide a solution to disable those buttons above keyboard 
len ratingone Did you ever thought there would be users hating this hating useless feature 
len ratingone The worst app I have used on my iPad ever 
len ratingone It is so complicated just to switch accounts from this thing on my MacBook is okay but on the iPad is awful it is so complicated I ended up removing my account from google chrome just to switch accounts 
len ratingone Many kids use this app so don t make it so freaking hard to do stuff on this every time it asked me to sign when I was already signed in and when i did it took me an hour just to wait until it loads so I suggest that you make it more easy 
len ratingone I have spent an hour of stress trying to log into my account because your app doesn t let me when I log in it does nothing and I have to sign in all over again 
len ratingone Website loading crashes doesn t crash entire application but makes app unusable 
len ratingone Switching to Firefox
len ratingfive Hi this app I love it the Pearson that made it five star app
len ratingfive Good
len ratingthree Would be a if it wasn t for this one problem 
len ratingthree As I and I m sure many others do we love our tabs 
len ratingthree The more the merrier as I m sure y all already know 
len ratingthree Unfinished projects entertainment cherished history all of that is contained within then and would hate for it to disappear which is exactly why we need a recovery option for all tabs as soon as possible 
len ratingthree Because hey accidents DO happen 
len ratingthree And somehow every other mobile browser had already included this feature as it s common sense 
len ratingthree I know I m bound to make this mistake again of closing all my tabs but hopefully the next time it happens I ll have a handy recovery option to save me 
len ratingthree Thanks for reading
len ratingfour It s gonna be a good idea to add a download feature in the next update 
len ratingfour It s been months which Apple has added it to Safari 
len ratingfive  Yah ass
len ratingone Love chrome but the app crashes and for the last two days won t open when I press on it 
len ratingfive It s helping me do stuff easier I like it
len ratingone Crashes repeatedly when I try to use it 
len ratingone Can t even browse for minutes before another crash happens 
len ratingone Basically unusable 
len ratingone I wish I could use it because I have used chrome on all other devices for years but this is absolutely way too much for me to stick with it 
len ratingone Guess I ll be switching to Firefox 
len ratingone The app keeps closing started after a recent update 
len ratingone Please resolve 
len ratingfive Soooo as we all know I use this app for one thing and delete it then get it back only for one reason PRn
len ratingone When I start typing the URL of a desired webpage Samsclub for example a pop up to share my location comes up and whether I click accept or deny it prevents the page from actually loading 
len ratingone I have to purposefully mess up a url to go to search for get to websites 
len ratingthree  We need to make app in dark mood when we reed article like android when I search chrome flags and put dark I get nothing and I still I don t know why 
len ratingfour In the latest update The program crashes when searching and the user cannot select it
len ratingfive I have never had any problems and it works with all of the sites I need 
len ratingone  Bing is better becuase well this app has a good microphone but no cool features like bing search results are poor 
len ratingthree It s cool but why is my tabs closing all of sudden 
len ratingthree I keep tabs open for a reason Last thing I need is some auto close feature 
len ratingone Probably will stop using chrome on mobile 
len ratingone Every time I exit the app it closes ALL my tabs 
len ratingone It never did this until I updated 
len ratingone Gotta use Firefox now 
len ratingone I need the tabs to stay open even when switching to another app because it s a phone 
len ratingone Chrome is garbage now 
len ratingone  There is a bug when rearranging bookmarks 
len ratingone I love a bookmark to the bottom of a folder and it reappears at the TOP of the list 
len ratingone This isn t a new bug 
len ratingthree  It s not showing any new articles for me 
len ratingthree It s not loading anything because it keeps saying can t load at this time 
len ratingthree Please fix this now
len ratingtwo  Can Google Chrome Get Any Worse 
len ratingfive  It s great
len ratingfour Fast efficient yet like how Firefox signs in me Depends on if u want speed or sec 
len ratingone Please update love the app 
len ratingone One star just to get your attention 
len ratingone  The Microsoft edge and safari have Adblock features 
len ratingone Chrome doesn t have Adblock bcuz google is tracking you using his browser 
len ratingone This app is google s shady business to collect ppl s data 
len ratingtwo No se pueden descargar los archivos PDF
len ratingfive is good I not know 
len ratingone  Literally collects all the data possible 
len ratingone Why the hell would you use Chrome when Safari Firefox and Brave are all options that don t track you 
len ratingone Firefox offers the best tracking protection but Brave pays you 
len ratingone Both were made by Mozilla 
len ratingtwo WHY IS A GOOGLE APP FOR AND UP 
len ratingtwo THE AGIN G IS WRONG 
len ratingtwo IM 
len ratingone Hey Google Latest version is constantly crashing on my iPad Pro with iOS installed

len ratingfive Chrome is epic
len ratingfive Can it be fixed 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone It s a great app for my searches but I know that they track your searches and sell it to other tracking companies so BOO 
len ratingone Google Chrome may be fast but the privacy is the issue 
len ratingone Google Chrome collects all of your information like what you search and sells it to people 
len ratingone They also modify your ads and searches based off of it 
len ratingone In google earns most of its money just from doing that 
len ratingone That is why Google Chrome must not be used 
len ratingone If you want something that is reliable then us DuckDuckGo
len ratingfive You can watch porn without getting caught
len ratingone Crashes are one thing but nowadays whenever the app crashes my open tabs are lost 
len ratingone It s unacceptable that there is no way to fix this 
len ratingone Time to switch to another browser I guess
len ratingthree iT DOES NOT SHOW ME MUCH STUFF
len ratingfive  I love this 
len ratingtwo I can t use this because it crashes my iPad 
len ratingtwo I can t open a tab and go back because it crashes 
len ratingtwo What did you do Google 
len ratingthree  Id like to swipe away tabs instead of having to press X to close them please add a gesture swipe to remove tabs thanks 
len ratingtwo Pages freeze when you go back to it 
len ratingtwo In the past couple months it has been crashing frequently 
len ratingtwo In the past week almost every time that I use it it crashes 
len ratingtwo Please help 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingone Please fix whatever you broke I need to program my asus router and now when it is disconnected from the internet chrome fails in communication with it like it need to report every page I hit even my router while offline and programming it 
len ratingone Please it didn t used to do this 
len ratingone I have to use chrome so I can be in desktop mode 
len ratingone KEEPS CRASHING LATELY CANT DO ANYTHING
len ratingone I ve started experiencing an issue where I get a frequent Aw Snap Error popping up when I open a page 
len ratingone I ve tried all of the suggested fixes but it doesn t help 
len ratingone I am unable to use the app therefore star 
len ratingone Most of the ads they call news story s ain t even stuff I m interested in and I can t get google maps to work with stupid Uber ads
len ratingone Let audio play in the background when I lock the screen 
len ratingone Works fine in safari so I believe it must be something google coded 
len ratingone Lame 
len ratingone Will certainly stop using chrome altogether if not fixed quickly 
len ratingone Chrome used to be a decent option for iOS but now it keeps freezing 
len ratingone It even froze multiple times with nothing open but the default tab and the feedback overlay 
len ratingtwo I cannot share the download files to another apps when I update my iOS 
len ratingtwo Why can I not adjust how long tabs stay in local memory 
len ratingtwo If I tap to different tab or app and then return the page pretty much always reloads 
len ratingtwo When you don t have the best data connection this is a major annoyance 
len ratingtwo I don t keep many tabs open and this happens with only one tab 
len ratingtwo Argh looking for a different option 
len ratingone It s now a daily occurrence for this app to crash multiple times per session 
len ratingone This happens across all my devices 
len ratingone Reports to developer have gone unanswered 
len ratingone I really wouldn t give it one star because it s so unstable and unusable 
len ratingone Google after buying your products customers deserve better than this 
len ratingtwo  Not user friendly 
len ratingtwo Can t search tabs 
len ratingtwo Multi tab management is trash 
len ratingtwo Everything is just more difficult 
len ratingone Normally I am a fan but the new update causes Chrome to crash or freeze CONSTANTLY 
len ratingone I ve switched to Firefox as a result and may never go back because I love it so much 
len ratingone Chrome has been recently crashing and losing all tabs 
len ratingone The restore tabs button doesn t show up and can t be accessed any other way 
len ratingone Massive amounts of lag in the new version 
len ratingone Constantly reloads pages because they aren t kept in memory 
len ratingone Redesigned UI is terrible buttons and features have been moved all over the place 
len ratingone The bookmark button is underneath another button and needs to be scrolled down to find lol 
len ratingone What a joke 
len ratingone Will be moving on to a new browser because of effort and time lost using Chrome 
len ratingone It really isn t designed for productivity and effectiveness 
len ratingone I wish Google could maintain a consistent functional and useful piece of software 
len ratingone  Slow laggy generally awful on both iPad and iPhone 
len ratingone I can have dozens of tabs open in safari with no problem 
len ratingone If I have more than a few in Chrome it s unbearable 
len ratingone Y all should be ashamed 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingtwo I can not play roblox
len ratingfive  J aime Google chrome
len ratingthree I love Chome but lately it s freezing so much from my most recent update I have LTE and WiFi Iphone max pro and it just is really lacking lately 
len ratingone I hate chrome
len ratingfour Chrome is so full of nice features yet lacks one of the essential features which makes me go back to Safari Again and again 
len ratingfour It is the reader mode to read a variety of articles in a big bold font on my phone screen 
len ratingfive Thanks so much for all your help great job
len ratingone This version is continuously crashing 
len ratingone The page freezes 
len ratingone When one types nothing shows up and then all typed characters appear in one go 
len ratingfour Why is every thing chrome 
len ratingtwo I loved chrome as long as it lasted 
len ratingtwo But there is really no support system if something does not work 
len ratingtwo The password saving feature broke on my Mac while it still works on other computers where I had my profile installed 
len ratingtwo But that does not help me a bit 
len ratingtwo I looked into every resource downloaded the passwords reinstalled them even looked I to some quite tech websites and did everything suggested wasted plenty of time on that 
len ratingtwo Final verdict a browsing Maschine that collects all my personal information and passwords already makes me uncomfortable even I could not resist the convenience for the longest time but passwords that first start changing randomly and then the whole password saving function runs amok without that chrome has a solution for that made me pull the plug 
len ratingone Chrome became very slow on my old ipad mini but safari working fine
len ratingfour  Certain links not opening 
len ratingone It never saved my passwords
len ratingfive  Amazing
len ratingtwo Please bring back the search button at the bottom of the screen and take away the giant add new tab button 
len ratingtwo It s frustrating opening a new tab every time you think you re about to search
len ratingone I have Youtube app installed and logged in to my username 
len ratingone Been using Chrome for a bit and all of a sudden I realize it s been auto connected to my Youtube account somehow 
len ratingone What 
len ratingone WHY DOES A BROWSER HAVE A USER ACCOUNT 
len ratingone Let alone one that auto connects your accounts 
len ratingone I ve had this happen with Google Maps as well 
len ratingone Shady has heck 
len ratingone Makes me even more skeptical of Google Products 
len ratingone  Don t Be Evil LOL 
len ratingone Lost all my tabs 
len ratingfive I am highly impressed with the work you guys do Google Chrome is even faster and has even better search results than the original Google 
len ratingfive I have absolutely no problems with anything while using your app keep doing what you do best 
len ratingtwo You ruined Chrome with your update 
len ratingtwo It doesn t want to let me interact with touch buttons on screen 
len ratingtwo Don t update if it breaks simple features
len ratingone  I have been using Chrome on my iPad just fine in desktop mode while in landscape at work 
len ratingone After not using it for a day I get on Chrome and found it to be in mobile app mode as if I m on my iPhone 
len ratingone I m now constantly having to request the desktop mode 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone  Chrome has been recently crashing and losing all tabs 
len ratingone The restore tabs button doesn t show up and can t be accessed any other way 
len ratingone Will be moving on to a new browser because of effort and time lost using Chrome 
len ratingone It really isn t designed for productivity and effectiveness 
len ratingfive  Loads my porn very fast
len ratingone My app freezes within seconds of opening on both my ipad and iphone on ios 
len ratingone Its been unusable for months and updates have not solved the issue 
len ratingone I did one star because I need request Android site
len ratingthree So where s dark theme 
len ratingtwo It is not good why because it won t allow me to put it on my iPad 
len ratingtwo So it is not good for iPads
len ratingone If you have it delete 
len ratingone Don t have it 
len ratingone Good 
len ratingone I hate the app 
len ratingone It can shut down it s a copy from safari and it s useless 
len ratingone The fake Siri comes out of no where too 
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingone Take it down goggle peeps 
len ratingone I had to rate this a star because it has to be at least one 
len ratingone But I want to rate it And also SUBSCRIBE to love that leopard
len ratingfour  ipad 
len ratingone I have it on my laptop and it does not open and I have to use it to do school work
len ratingone Too slow 
len ratingone This is an example of if nothing is wrong why fix it 
len ratingone It is so much more difficult to switch between tabs and incognito view compared to earlier version 
len ratingone I can see the only reason is for some d a 
len ratingone at google to have something to do 
len ratingone Teachers are annoying
len ratingtwo  i m gonna start using safari because chrome had an update with a circle inside of the lock and i m not sure if it s normal so i m gonna be using safari for my safety 
len ratingfour I prefer this version safari and Normal google 
len ratingfour The layout is awesome and great for doing research 
len ratingfour Normal google is overwhelming and complex 
len ratingfour This is simple yet great for everything 
len ratingtwo  Chrome is far slower compared to Safari on my iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo I only use chrome for my school account 
len ratingtwo When will window support be added for chrome 
len ratingtwo I find it annoying when I have to switch back and forth between tabs 
len ratingthree When will you consider make desktop mode default or at least give us a choice in the settings to make it default 
len ratingthree Plz
len ratingfive  IT IS AWESOME
len ratingtwo  I can t use this because it crashes my iPad 
len ratingtwo Ehat did you do Google 
len ratingfive The best
len ratingone Can t go wrong with a little more extra special security 
len ratingone Why am I entirely unable to sign out of my gmail account from the google chrome app on my iPad 
len ratingone I cannot find an option or setting anywhere Firstly this is inconvenient because I cannot switch accounts without going to the private tab 
len ratingone Secondly this is INVASIVE 
len ratingone Why must google keep my account signed in 
len ratingone I cannot switch to other accounts 
len ratingone The only options available are manage account amp manage account and devices and both are entirely useless 
len ratingone One only allows me to adjust browsing history options the other prompts a blank pop up from which I can do literally nothing because it s blank 
len ratingone it won t let me DWNLOAD IT

len ratingthree Moving from android back to iOS I don t understand why the tabs don t swipe like they do in the android version of chrome 
len ratingthree The way it works not has me looking at other browsers 
len ratingtwo I no longer see my bookmarks they won t sync 
len ratingtwo It synced from my laptop to my phone fine but the iPad just keeps spinning 
len ratingone  Everytime I am on a new page there are a lot of pop ups asking me to download stuff 
len ratingone  I have to use a browser that has desktop mode to even get in and with this latest version I cannot get connected it just times out 
len ratingone It worked fine until I updated chrome which I only did because a site was telling me that I was running an older version 
len ratingone Irony That site still doesn t work 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone Hdhshshsnuchhhjhjxhxxyhdjafdjjdhdh
len ratingone Everytime I click on a link it opens another page 
len ratingone No way to prevent it from it happening 
len ratingone Please Google replace the SHARE button in the adress bar with the REFRESH CANCEL button that is switchable to one or the other according to the loading state of the page just like previous versions of your app 
len ratingone I should be able to cancel refresh a webpage without fumbling with option MENU 
len ratingone Makes browsing much easier and intuitive 
len ratingone Put SHARE button somewhere else 
len ratingone  Hey you 
len ratingone Sometimes Ur stupid app wont let me in my ipad 
len ratingone Everything i tried for this retarded app nothing goes with it 
len ratingone One time this really google chronic disease app made my ipad crash that i had to repair the crap out of it 
len ratingone U dont make compatible apps for small devices like mine 
len ratingone On my iphone i crash everytime there are at least tabs 
len ratingone And then it saids sending crash reports 
len ratingone I had to reinstall this really stupid app again to run it normally the freaking again 
len ratingone I WOULD RATHER USE YAHOO SEARCH 
len ratingthree  Web browser is fine however whenever I use the app on my new Pro Max I can feel the phone heat up and eventually get hot to the touch 
len ratingthree This is the only app that causes my phone to do this and it s slightly concerning 
len ratingone Come on Google and Apple 
len ratingone If my year old smartphone can sync tabs shouldn t my new iPad do at least as well 
len ratingone This app is becoming a disappointment 
len ratingthree Only one suggestion and I will rate this app stars Make Chrome for iPad desktop class
len ratingone I won t let me download it on my computer
len ratingone GOOGLE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU 
len ratingone I SEARCH ONE THING MANY TIMES BUT ALL THAT COMES UP ARE DIFFERENT THINGS 
len ratingone HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE YOUR SELFISH APPS OFF THE STORE AND GO ANNOY OTHER PEOPLE OR JUST LEAVE 
len ratingone I DONT CARE BUT IF I COULD I WOULD NOT DO MY SCHOOLWORK OR YOUR STALKING APPS MY DEVICE HAS GOTTEN A VIRUS OF TEN FROM YOUR APPS 
len ratingone GO STALK SOMEONE WHO WILL GIVE UP THE INFORMATION FOR THEIR PERSONAL THINGS WITH ANGER SNOWDOG
len ratingone  And on top of that it s always crashing 
len ratingone So it crashes I lose my tabs cuz it didn t shut down properly then it can t restore my tabs 
len ratingone Use Edge instead to get chromium browser rendering without ridiculous levels of tracking 
len ratingone It is
len ratingtwo  Love google but this update has made it worse
len ratingfive  Outlookoffice
len ratingone Removed my old version downloaded the latest which had fixes for crashing 
len ratingone First website I went to cracked 
len ratingone This is wack as hell I was tryin to enjoy a nice day and then I realized I have to do some stupid essay
len ratingfive  thanks
len ratingone My iPad strongly needs the only desktop mode
len ratingone I downloaded google Chrome for IOS for one purpose 
len ratingone It s not there anymore 
len ratingone  Your browser loads anything but my yahoo mail 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone I am beyond tired of the stupid chrome keyboard showing up as the only option often when I m trying to change passwords on my website 
len ratingone It s ridiculous 
len ratingone I m switching to edge 
len ratingone I hate google chrome
len ratingone I tried go on a web site but it load longer so I give it Review
len ratingone Whenever you try to get another account on chrome it makes you put in the password so I did that 
len ratingone Than it says something so weird I think to prove your not a robot but I did that and I kept on doing that over and over and over again because I put in my password and than put in what the word says to prove I m not a robot then it says pUt In YOuR PasSwOrD 
len ratingone And I already did then I re enter it and than I have to re enter the robot word thing and than that keeps on happening over and over 
len ratingone I just want to sign into my school account to do online work because of corona and you are not letting me 
len ratingone Ugh 
len ratingone  The Bookmarks functionality is terrible 
len ratingone How about a few options features 
len ratingone General lack of settings is also increased incredibly frustrating 
len ratingfive Chrome usually loads web pages better and faster than safari
len ratingone Boi
len ratingfive  It looks really want to google classroom and that s what I need it for
len ratingfive V
len ratingfive I just read to Forbes article about the security problem 
len ratingfive How can I update chrome
len ratingone Really it is
len ratingfive I always use Crome and it fast and reliable the recommended articles are great too 
len ratingfive In all honesty it can be on any deviec ios or andriod or whatever i ise it is the most relaiable ever i love chrome keep up the good work guys i only find it to be slow when it is bad weather or crappy signal not be cause of the operating system looove google
len ratingone  Constantly crashes 
len ratingone For years 
len ratingfive  Is this related to google it s self 
len ratingfive Some body help meh 
len ratingone App doesn t work can t open the app 
len ratingone Where is your fix 
len ratingone  The keyboard on my iPhone plus is very laggy and the browsing performance is not as before so I m using Firefox right now until you fix that 
len ratingfive I don t get the poor reviews 
len ratingfive Chrome on both iOS and macOS make Safari feel like molasses 
len ratingfive Syncing works perfectly 
len ratingfive It works with every website 
len ratingfive The only thing that could be added to make this browser perfect is a built in web blocker like Edge has 
len ratingone Not support n no updates version
len ratingone Chrome keeps shutting down unexpectedly and it s very slow 
len ratingone I always have to restart my iPad to have stupid chrome working again and I don t think that s good for my iPad 
len ratingone I have decided to uninstall it and get Mozilla Firefox instead 
len ratingone Why whenever I m trying to do something it says unsupported browser update to latest version 
len ratingone My chrome randomly crashed and ALL my tabs and info are just gone 
len ratingone So much info I m not getting back from lost tabs now 
len ratingone This is ridiculous 
len ratingone It s slower now and deleted all my tabs 
len ratingone So mad
len ratingone  This has happened at least times in a month span where it will just randomly close EVERY SINGLE tab I had open for no apparent reason and guess what 
len ratingone This app doesn t even have an option to reopen previous tabs you have to go through your full search history to search for stuff and I had so many tabs and so many from months ago that I will never be able to find through the history 
len ratingone Don t get this app 
len ratingone It s horrible in every way 
len ratingone Never had this problem ONCE with Safari 
len ratingone Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Boi my boiiii chaz does not like it reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yeeeeeeeeeeeeeet freeeeeeeeeet YEEEEEEEEEEET I am only a kid it was a dare Pot at o
len ratingone Really not happy with the way it constantly crashes 
len ratingone I ve cleared my cache restarted my phone and it still crashes 
len ratingone Needs better bug fixes 
len ratingtwo You need to update your browser big time major flicker issues and it s annoying 
len ratingtwo And not able to fix it our selfs tried to 
len ratingtwo You have to update 
len ratingone Booooo Ewwww Know one likes it Take it off the apple store now Hate it Next
len ratingfour I don t understand why but it keeps crashing I rely on google chrome but it s being impossible to work with 
len ratingfour Google why can you not include a mobile version of the chrome web store for the iOS app 
len ratingfour Honestly if you can just take some time to develop a watered down version of the web store I would be happy 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingthree Please fix this I prefer using Chrome over safari but this keeps happening 
len ratingthree  If yall dont fix it then send me a new chromebook please
len ratingone This is why it s the worst 
len ratingone So right now I m in nd grade and I had a assignment in chrome 
len ratingone So when I looked backed to google classroom it started over my assignment 
len ratingone  Second there are lines that words go through 
len ratingone When I was done I forgot to do one more thing but I had to start over 
len ratingone  Last it didn t let me see my awnsers on lots of assignments accept 
len ratingone This is the worst ever 
len ratingthree I think google chrome should add an ad block feature or let us use an ad block apps to block ads thanks 
len ratingone Ever since I recently updated this app it is super slow and it s currently frozen and I can t search anything
len ratingfive It works like better than any search engine on the AppStore I ve seen it works so perfectly on iOS iPad gen it never crashed ever it just reloads when there s errors I really like this app I want it to be better and better even though it s so good
len ratingtwo I tried Chrome because I prefer it on the desktop but the iOS version isn t very good 
len ratingtwo I ll switch back to Safari on iOS until Chrome ups it s game 
len ratingone  It is just safari but with less features 
len ratingone Tab sync is broken and the browser is sluggish not to mention google invading your privacy 
len ratingone I ve been using Brave and Safari both of which are much much better 
len ratingone Since the past couple of updates Chrome starts abruptly crashing 
len ratingone Not recommended in 
len ratingone WHY IS THIS SO CLUMSY AAAAAAAAAAAAA WHY DOSENT IT RESPOND EMEDIATLY WHEN I CLICK SOMETHING AAAAAAAAAA WHY DOSEN T THE STUFF WORK FOR APPS AND STUF IDK AAAAAA I DONT LIKE IT BYE
len ratingfive  Where s Chrome Bonus when i m on the website Pixlr com X i can t import a font file on a project Please fix it
len ratingone Cant even install from iPad 
len ratingone So annoying
len ratingone  just use Safari in iOS 
len ratingone  It s so stupid i was trying to look for NON VENOMOUS snakes for pets and It s results had Hognose snakes coral snakes and tons more that were venomous stupid google 
len ratingone My children are on chrome and that is just bad
len ratingone The normal iOS keyboard doesn t haven t a period button next to the space bar but chrome added a period to the right of the space bar and now it s so annoying to type 
len ratingone I keep tapping on it instead 
len ratingone Wish there was a way to edit your keyboard or they should move the period to the left of the space bar
len ratingfive  EmjdnfthrjueurrjkskJCTFYFJYVHFKtydrstf
len ratingtwo  Everytime I search something when I press enter on my search it ll start loading the search and than it ll completely reset the tab and i ll have to re type in my search again and than it ll actually work 
len ratingtwo Happens of time when I open chrome 
len ratingone How can you create a gesture like swiping on the screen from right to left to make you go back to the previous page 
len ratingone I can t swipe through pictures or even move around on a zoomed webpage without accidentally taking myself back a page 
len ratingone Makes the app almost useless 
len ratingone  Safari and UC browser is the way to go 
len ratingone I don t know who s sniffing glue over at Google but there is NO CAPABILITY NOW OR BEFORE this Faster Chrome Update 
len ratingone VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING Google 
len ratingone To think SAFARI is outdistancing you 
len ratingone Now who s the tortoise and who s the hare 
len ratingone Get it together Goggle 
len ratingone It s not good at all 
len ratingone  I hat this app
len ratingfour  Cooll
len ratingone I liked Chrome for the mix of news it displayed 
len ratingone Now it won t turn the Discover feature even when I m signed in 
len ratingone The setting refuses to save 
len ratingone I guess it is over to Firefox or Safari 
len ratingone Bad move Google 
len ratingone Ir crashes all the time
len ratingtwo I was wondering if I can re download the older version of chrome for my iPad mini st gen if not than I don t what to do
len ratingthree put the suggestions back on search
len ratingtwo It s a cool browser though it is crashing suddenly much more then other popular browsers like Edge Firefox 
len ratingtwo Not to mention Safari which just doesn t 
len ratingtwo The Chrome is nice yet it s really not the feature upgrade I had been looking to 
len ratingfour  Ok
len ratingone If I play any browser video videos won t play the video but will play the accompanying audio perfectly 
len ratingone I have good signal and a new ish phone plus 
len ratingone It lets me play downloaded videos or any videos already downloaded on the phone separately so my video on my phone should work but something about the chrome app isn t letting any videos play for me 
len ratingone I can even watch YouTube videos perfectly fine with audio and video but something about the codec or download or flash java idk what iPhone uses but it s not being compatible now
len ratingone I have always loved Chrome 
len ratingone It used to work great on my iPad and iPhone 
len ratingone However why does this not have the ability to zoom in or out on your pages 
len ratingone Pinching doesn t work 
len ratingone I have one site I work with regularly and since I use my iPad for my business this is a hindrance 
len ratingone I do not own a laptop 
len ratingone This is it 
len ratingone My chrome is up to date with the latest version yet one of the websites I used for online marketing keeps telling me to use the current version of Chrome 
len ratingone I have it 
len ratingone Or is there a lag between the Chrome version on IOS devices versus the Chrome available on Microsoft laptops 
len ratingone Won t let me download it
len ratingfive Noob
len ratingfive  You have been so kind gracious and compassionate 
len ratingfive I will eternally be GgggG grateful for your business 
len ratingtwo  S L O W and keeps crashing 
len ratingone  Chrome for iOS isn t really Chrome it s a slower less feature rich version of Safari 
len ratingone From unannounced browser UI changes to critical features breaking Chrome has really lost the excellent fit and finish that elevated it to emerge as the go to browser 
len ratingone I ve used Chrome for iOS for the past couple of months and the quality of the browser has been on a steady decline 
len ratingone Tab Syncing has been broken for a broad range of users for many months now app crashes and irregular slowdowns have been plaguing users for a year or more now 
len ratingone Long presses are hit or miss sometimes they highlight text sometimes they bring up the Cut amp Paste New Tab menu 
len ratingone Both Chrome and Safari are based on the same web engine WebKit yet only Safari allows Ad blockers Content Blockers as Apple refers to them 
len ratingone Safari is quicker to load the same webpages and is increasingly refining and adding features leaving Chrome with little to no unique features of its own 
len ratingone It s saving grace has been Tab and Bookmark Sync between Chrome on other devices but that has been broken for months now 
len ratingone This is not to say that Chrome on its own isn t a snappy browser because it is but Safari does everything Chrome does and better much much better 
len ratingone Overall Chrome for iOS has sadly been on a decline and really needs an overhaul to be fully functional let alone competitive 
len ratingthree The app is functional and I don t have many problems with it but recently the search button at the bottom of the screen was changed to a new tab button and it s been annoying to deal with
len ratingthree  Where is my zoom with finger 
len ratingthree And a lot of errors can t not zoom when i watching a movie in many websites
len ratingtwo I tried watching Turkish series on goggle chrome and it is frustrating 
len ratingtwo It is for ever leaving the site and when you go back on all these other sites turn up and disgusting porn pictures that I have tried to get rid of but not successful 
len ratingtwo This should not be allowed 
len ratingfive  Hey why we can t use Chrome to play Stadia 
len ratingone This stupid app has every problem you can think of 
len ratingone I find any app that starts with the word google except for Google earth should be deleted off the face of the earth 
len ratingone Google Docs is the worst 
len ratingone I can not even copy and paste stuff anymore 
len ratingone The new way of highlighting is awful and there is to many problems to explain 
len ratingtwo The button centered at the bottom of the app used to allow for easy searching without having to reach up to the search bar to type my entry 
len ratingtwo Instead this button is a new tab option which is pointless 
len ratingtwo I have opened more new tabs than I could ever imagine while trying to search Google quickly yet I am left frustrated when it opens a new knowing that it used to be a search option 
len ratingtwo Opening a new tab does not even focus the user to the search bar 
len ratingtwo Please revert or give us the option to choose its functionality 
len ratingfive I m not sure if it is the chrome update that happened yesterday or the new Apple update 
len ratingfive However chrome no longer launches on my iPhone 
len ratingone UI is subpar it would have been more intuitive if there is an address bar to start with at the top rather than just google search bar in the center 
len ratingone Desktop UI for chrome is lot better then ipad app 
len ratingone Font selection is very poor
len ratingone This is not a very good thing for kids they can make inappropriate classes during class not a good app for schools
len ratingfive  thanks
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive The app knows me very well
len ratingfive Easy to use and works all of the time 
len ratingone Crash upon opening 
len ratingone Terrible unuseful hurts my soul 
len ratingtwo The recent app update changed the center button from a search button to an add tab button 
len ratingtwo Adding tabs option was already being presented by holding down the number of tabs 
len ratingtwo I deem this change unnecessary and has resulted in me opening tabs that I don t intend to open 
len ratingtwo It s super inconvenient 
len ratingone It used to me the best browser ever any platform any support 
len ratingone The new mobile version is terrible 
len ratingone Translate never works 
len ratingone Every page prompts me the info about he account I am logged with which I don t care 
len ratingone The is a bar at the top with the same info about the website I am on useless 
len ratingone But most importantly translate detects all pages in English 
len ratingone Once manually select the correct language it does nothing and no translation occurs anymore 
len ratingfive So when I got this app I was not really hopeful But when I really got to know it I started to love it the you so much Google Chrome 
len ratingone Let people block ads if they choose to 
len ratingone Chrome started crashing daily on my iPhone maybe weeks ago 
len ratingone So frustrating as you lose your open tabs and if you don t hit the restore button quickly then there is no easy way to restore your closed tabs 
len ratingone Browsing history is useless as it is more than just recently closed tabs 
len ratingone And if you click a link in an email to open Chrome and Chrome crashes there is no restore button option 
len ratingone Pretty weak effort from google 
len ratingone It says and up we re only kids doing are classes on here
len ratingtwo Chrome is great on computers 
len ratingtwo But not on IPad as it seems made for phones 
len ratingtwo They should learn from Safari here and offer something more desktop like 
len ratingfour The suggestions do not appear when searching
len ratingfive Beautifully
len ratingtwo There is no history once I got out of chrome when I came back ALL SCHOOL WORK IS GONE 
len ratingone I can t open it 
len ratingone I was using Chrome for a very long time and didn t experience much issues 
len ratingone Recently after switching to Safari I m beginning to see how irrelevant Chrome is 
len ratingone The browser is slower there doesn t seem to be much customization like Safari allows and crashes that can t restore my previous session 
len ratingone Please fix the issues at hand 
len ratingfive I have been using chrome for a while it is an amazing app read some of the views but it is a great app but I do have some ideas to make it better you don t have to take these but make it where you can make an article because some people have things to say I think they should have a voice and try as hard as you can to add games because my kids love to play games on my phone but they go on chrome thinking it s a game but then when they see it they get disappointed because they wanted to play a game but they have not explored I have not even explored but it is a great app
len ratingone I am pretty upset that I bought the new MacBook Air version for school only to find out that it is no longer available on the MacBooks 
len ratingone I would give it zero stars but it still works on my ipad and iphone 
len ratingone PLEASE MAKE THIS AVAILABLE ON FREAKING MACBOOKS SO I CAN DO MY SCHOOL WORK SINCE WE ARE IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT REQUIRES ME TO DO SCHOOL FROM HOME 
len ratingfive Nice app I recommend you getting it 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT TO GET THIS APP DO GET IT RIGHT NOW OMG OMG

len ratingone Google has really been dropping the ball on a lot of stuff 
len ratingone  It s even possible the app is even causing my audio to stay mute until I restart my iPad Pro 
len ratingfour And no it s no fully released after clearing cache and browsing history
len ratingtwo nd EDIT Links from Gmail open Chrome but no new tab is created and I can t get to the actual url 
len ratingtwo Switching to Safari for now 
len ratingtwo EDIT The issue below was fixed and I received a reply from the developers 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingtwo Since I upgraded to iOS Chrome shows the list of all the Google accounts logged in on my phone every time I switch to the app 
len ratingtwo  Fixed More importantly about half the time new tabs are created in a minimized state and I can t go into them when I tap 
len ratingtwo  Fixed Hey there thanks for reaching out 
len ratingtwo We have released an updated version of Chrome that resolves this behavior 
len ratingtwo Check the latest update in our help community 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingone  Wanna use a web browser that crashes every ten now five minutes on the dot 
len ratingone Then chrome has you covered 
len ratingone From the moment you open the app till the moment you close it you ll regret every moment and wonder why you didn t use that time to download another browser 
len ratingone Oh they ll fix it in an update just to break it again in the next update 
len ratingone Google this is funny and sad all at once 
len ratingone Safari gives the iPad real desktop class browsing 
len ratingone Chrome still feels like a giant iPhone 
len ratingone  We re sorry you re facing this issue 
len ratingone Background playback is not available on mobile browsers without a YouTube Red membership 
len ratingone Please click here to learn more 
len ratingone  I Can t Send Feedback 
len ratingfour Two balls in my mouth
len ratingone  used to be so good 
len ratingone nothing loads at all and everything always crashes 
len ratingone thought it was my wifi or phone but it s chrome 
len ratingone very disappointed
len ratingone  I absolutely cannot stand the new update 
len ratingone I ve barely used google since it happened and I can t tell you how many times I ve tried to click the button at the bottom and instead opened a new tab 
len ratingone It s inconvenient and was much easier the other way 
len ratingone Also please add an option to ask before closing out all of the tabs 
len ratingone The button is too easily accessible and I just lost tabs some of them important articles from months ago 
len ratingone I can t scroll back that far to find them 
len ratingone That is the problem and why I would give it a absolute star 
len ratingone It always gets very annoying and happens every single time 
len ratingone This problem need to get worked on because it is really failing me 
len ratingone Even when I have only tab tabs or tabs open it still happens on IOS 
len ratingone When there s that message it just completely removed all the other previous tabs it s annoying amp maddening 
len ratingfive Please add support for extensions 
len ratingfour I go on chrome web store and it says I don t have chrome WHEN IM LITERALLY ON CHROME fix this please
len ratingone Didn t want this app but I needed to pay rent and my iPhone wouldn t allow me to access the pay portal unless I downloaded this app 
len ratingone If they forced you to download what s stopping them from forcing you to pay 
len ratingone Not down to be control 
len ratingone I don t think this browser is a good at all 
len ratingone It s terrible and it always does Oh Snap Because I have tabs 
len ratingone It s terrible 
len ratingone It s slow and doesn t work correctly 
len ratingone Thank God I have Safari it s Google BUT BETTER 
len ratingone I cannot stand this Oh Snap 
len ratingone It s very annoying and it disrupts me very annoyingly 
len ratingone I like the Google Chrome on a laptop better 
len ratingone If you have a laptop you should carry it around so you don t have to have Oh Snap 
len ratingone Disrupting you every minutes 
len ratingone Also a problem that is says is Too many Tabs 
len ratingone I barely even have that many tabs ever 
len ratingone Google all you really want is money 
len ratingone I m quitting google chrome because every update gets worse 
len ratingone Goodbye Google 
len ratingone Obviously the best browser on the planet but I m giving star for the most annoying bug ever 
len ratingone When chrome crashes on iOS then it often gives only one chance to restore your tabs except when the option goes away before you can click it 
len ratingone I m a doctor and with the pandemic this is the worst possible time to be stressing over losing all your tabs 
len ratingone There NEEDS to be a way to go into history and get them all back like there is on the desktop browser 
len ratingone This is unacceptable ongoing issue for the past few years that I have have chrome on my cell phone 
len ratingone Really Pushing me over the edge with the work pressure right now
len ratingone Stop chanelling your profits to drill oil
len ratingthree The browsing on this app is very slow I m tired of having to wait
len ratingone So I was using this app for my work then when I put save the next hours I came back it was gone 
len ratingone Don t use this app it s bad 
len ratingone Keeps crashing on iPhone 
len ratingone This is very annoying 
len ratingone Many sites failed to load or they just hang 
len ratingone On Safari they load perfectly 
len ratingone Google fix this problem ASAP or I must be forced to switch to Safari for good 
len ratingfive Send
len ratingthree Would like to have the ability to keep web pages displayed in desktop view permanently 
len ratingthree And to have a reader view 
len ratingthree  I keep a bunch of windows open at any given time for easy access and it is SOOOO easy to accidentally close them all 
len ratingthree That is a horrible button 
len ratingthree At least make it so you have to hold it for a few seconds and or it asks you if you re sure 
len ratingthree I keep deleting them all just due to looking at something and putting my phone down for a second 
len ratingthree Very aggravating 
len ratingthree  I used to love this app but a couple of days ago it started closing my tabs 
len ratingthree Before if I hit my home button to look at something else when I opened Chrome up again all my tabs were still there just like I left them 
len ratingthree But now it has a window at the bottom saying that Chrome didn t shut down properly 
len ratingthree I can restore my session but I shouldn t have to 
len ratingthree There is one website that I go to all the time so I leave it open 
len ratingthree Don t fix what isn t broken Google 
len ratingone Used to be a great app but now it just crashes every time I open the app 
len ratingone Completely useless would give zero stars if I could 
len ratingthree There s no dark mode
len ratingtwo  Aw snap on many different web pages 
len ratingtwo Cleared browser and cache 
len ratingtwo Started about weeks ago 
len ratingfive Big pp
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone  Okay I LOVE this app and I use it all the time but I HATE when it just randomly shuts down out of nowhere and then it deleted all of my tabs 
len ratingone I don t even get to restore them all either so it makes things worse 
len ratingone If you can stop the random shut downs I ll give a star rating but these random shut downs need to stop and its a pain when all my tabs get erased randomly 
len ratingone I don t understand why the age limit for google chrome is 
len ratingone This is the stupidest thing I ve ever come across 
len ratingone I keep getting a message this needs to be updated and no link to update
len ratingone Letters are too small in iPhone 
len ratingone No way to change that 
len ratingone Websites from Apple 
len ratingone Google etc claim that changing the font size larger in settings will reflect the change in chrome app that is just not true 
len ratingone Some websites say there is an option in the chrome browser app not true 
len ratingone Chrome browser app in the iPhone is useless because I cannot read it 
len ratingthree  The app works fine most of the time for me but sometimes when I m watching a video or downloading a pdf it freezes or crashes 
len ratingfive The
len ratingfive  Google chrome
len ratingone This has been happening since last month making the browser almost unusable 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone  USERPROFILE AppData Local Google Chrome Cleanup Tool Quarantine 
len ratingone Google is trash if your account gets hacked you better hope no personal information is on it or your screwed 
len ratingone  I love google but there is no way to block ads when visiting websites other browsers allow to use extension too 
len ratingone I ll stay with safari 
len ratingone  The title says it all 
len ratingone I work with landscape engineering circuit schematics and sideways is useless on a device that rotates when you do 
len ratingone Chrome on the desktop rotates them fine 
len ratingone  Bring back old search button 
len ratingone The app itself is pleasant to use but the close all apps button is way too easy to accidentally hit and is too close to the new tab button 
len ratingone Once you ve closed all tabs there is no way to reopen them all unless they re all in the recent history section even then you must reopen them all individually 
len ratingone  Wanna use a web browser that crashes every ten minutes on the dot 
len ratingone Then chrome has you covered 
len ratingone From the moment you open the app till the moment you close it you ll regret every moment and wonder why you didn t use that time to download another browser 
len ratingone Oh they ll fix it in an update just to break it again in the next update 
len ratingone Google this is funny and sad all at once 
len ratingfive I love the porn
len ratingone Great app for stealing your information 
len ratingfour  Please add dark mode to the IPad version of chrome 
len ratingthree This browser is great and the only issue is that it is a little slow 
len ratingthree I have good internet and this is a little slow 
len ratingthree It is better than safari 
len ratingfive  This app is awesome because it searches up fast and searches up the topic you want 
len ratingfive  i love this app you need to download this app for sure really
len ratingfive Works great used it forever
len ratingfour I usually use Chromebooks and computers 
len ratingfour They work better then this 
len ratingfour  A pentillion percent better 
len ratingtwo For some bizarre reason my omnibar button in the center of the app turned into a new tab button 
len ratingtwo This is a terrible change which makes the app less functional 
len ratingtwo Not sure if it s a bug or a poor design change but please fix it 
len ratingtwo I reported the bug inside the app and got no response 
len ratingtwo I have always been a strong supporter of Google and their services but Chrome has given me nothing but trouble the last year or so 
len ratingtwo I ve contact tech support multiple times so they are aware of the issue and apparently can t fix it 
len ratingtwo While reading almost any article the page suddenly reload with and error page saying the site can t be reached even though I was just in the middle of reading it 
len ratingtwo I use other browsers and no issues

len ratingthree Chrome is great for everything and works across all my devices so it s nice but the app recently changed one of their buttons and is making it a hassle to use 
len ratingthree The center button at the bottom of the screen used to pull up the search bar a the keyboard which made it easy instead of having to reach to the top of the screen to tap the omnibar to start searching 
len ratingthree It is now a new tab button that is really frustrating as I instinctively tap that button when I pull up a new tab 
len ratingthree So now I have to close the second new tab and then tap the omnibar at the top of my iPhone which has a pretty lengthy screen 
len ratingthree A bit of a regression in terms of user friendliness so I m writing this in hopes of them changing the button back or at least giving us the option to choose what the button does 
len ratingfive Best best best
len ratingfive  This app is really good But i want to recommend a good hacker to you you looking for a professional spy agency that can spy your boyfriend girlfriend account within short period of time 
len ratingfive Message me for more details or text A trial will convince you He help me that is why i want you to met him He hack and open hacked account He is professional He spy on what you spouse is doing on his her device Get in touch with him now n thank me later
len ratingfive  Wow
len ratingone translate stopped working with latest update 
len ratingone  gt 
len ratingfive This will be short 
len ratingfive So when I use Crome it saves what I search and its really annoying 
len ratingfive What I m saying you should make another mod that makes nothing save in Search 
len ratingfive Goggle chrome is the best I can have all of my test on there I do all my homework and test on there and also I ask questions so I can get the right answer and when I do my test on goggle chrome I pass them Thank you Goggle chrome wrote by kj 
len ratingfive It is good
len ratingone Why do i have to download the google apps if this is google chrome and I can search things up 
len ratingone And the dots next to your picture what is the point of that if it just tells you to download the app and a App Store thing pops up 
len ratingfive It helps me with my studies at school 
len ratingfive I can get access to any apps I don t have like google docs 
len ratingfive Anything is possible with google chrome 
len ratingfive But sometimes you are so focused into work 
len ratingfive It helps me stay tuned 
len ratingfive It makes me feel proud 
len ratingfive It is a great app 
len ratingone Screw Google and their guilty until proven innocent attitude 
len ratingone Hard to do since they re practically a monopoly but I ll get by 
len ratingone Firefox and duck duck go from now on 
len ratingone I need to find another voice over internet service as well but I ll manage 
len ratingone  Never had a problem with chrome always downloaded it for more then years been using it on the phone computer my problem I m having is all my tabs been closing I woke up an checks my taps they was all closed so I lost all my info that I looked up happend twice I need you to fix this or it ll be time for me to put chrome to rest an find a different browser
len ratingone We need desktop version which Apple has exploited on the safari since the iPad os 
len ratingone The back of my phone gets extremely hot when using chrome just for browsing on my iPhone please fix this 
len ratingone Will adjust review when it s fixed 
len ratingone I have submitted at least one if not two report issue reports and have heard nothing 
len ratingone I am tired Chrome crashing and the didn t close properly issues 
len ratingone Even when I use the Restore Tabs option the app immediately crashes again and I still lose all my tabs 
len ratingone Google PLEASE fix this 
len ratingone I know that this has been an ongoing issue for years and I surprised that a big company like yourselves have yet to fix it or come up with a solution 
len ratingone With phones getting so big now a days it was nice to have a browser that had a button at the bottom to be able to activate the address bar and keyboard so I didn t have to reach all the way to the top of the screen to enter in an address 
len ratingone Honestly it s what kept me using this browser over safari but now that google changed the button to be new tab I m switching back to safari 
len ratingone This browser is fast and convenient but SO UNSTABLE 
len ratingone There will be times when the app force quits and clears all my incognito tabs 
len ratingone This happens to me regularly and I lose all information since incognito tabs can t be recovered 
len ratingone It s really disappointing and embarrassing that this browser wins by default because it has native translation 
len ratingfive  Best browser on desktop and mobile 
len ratingone As Google Advertising becomes more expensive so does the rapid expansion of ad ID trackers 
len ratingone Google Chrome once used to be a blazing fast and secure browser we could all rely on now it s been updated so that Google can paint a perfect picture of you and push more ads to you 
len ratingone Well during corona visits not many people are spending 
len ratingone Time for an update 
len ratingthree  My favorite feature about this browser on iPhone was the search bar at the bottom of the screen but that was removed in the latest update 
len ratingthree Please bring it back 
len ratingone Useless websearch engine 
len ratingone Doesn t have a previous page it always gets stuckon page no return to previous site want s to save passwords all the time not a safe browser
len ratingthree Will you please consider putting the search bar back at the bottom of the screen where you ve now placed the plus sign to add a new page 
len ratingthree One of the main reasons I use Google over Safari is because of ease of use and now you ve gotten rid of that 
len ratingthree I ll switch to Safari for now to see how well it works since it has a more robust antivirus system so to speak for the iPhone 
len ratingtwo I like Chrome because I have all my things synced with it but the lack of desktop class browsing for iPad is awful 
len ratingtwo I have already started slowly moving things to Safari as I need them 
len ratingtwo If Chrome isn t up to speed soon I will have no reason to use it on my iPad anymore 
len ratingtwo When I search in the address bar there is a list of results 
len ratingtwo If I try scrolling to see the items cut off by the keyboard the list just disappears 
len ratingtwo Fail 
len ratingone I went on a webpage and it said you have viruses
len ratingfour I love chrome but this new update is pissing me off 
len ratingfour The fact that they removed the search button and made it a new tab button makes me so mad 
len ratingfour It was perfect you could have a hand on the bottom of your phone around your charger and operate the whole app with one hand 
len ratingfour Now if you want to search something you now have to move your hand away from the bottom and press the search bar 
len ratingfour So GOOGLE PLEASE REVERT THE NEW TAB BUTTON TO A SEARCH BUTTON IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER 
len ratingone Freezes after seconds 
len ratingone iPad Air Pro and iPhone X 
len ratingthree Sorry to say this browser doesn t block all pop ups like it s sapost well it didn t when I went on a anime website to watch dragonball hero s and so my adds popt up it was sad and downloaded Firefox plus u get way more privacy with Firefox and blocks all the adds and crap google chrome couldn t deliver on no cross site trackings or anything like that at all on Firefox plus Firefox loads up the webpages way faster then google chrome ever could sorry ur app has been deleted from my 
len ratingone Oh why did I update the app 
len ratingone After the new update the google app crashes constantly and you aren t able to restore 
len ratingone Garbage 
len ratingtwo i always use this browser export in the pc but in IOS this app battery life was too short 
len ratingthree It has happened a few times where chrome will crash deleting all my old tabs and if you accidentally close the tab where the restore prompt pops up from there is no other way to save all of the tabs you lost 
len ratingthree I use chrome a lot on my ipad so its just really frustrating to lose all of your tabs without a way to be able to restore them 
len ratingfive Best ever
len ratingfive Google is very dumb
len ratingtwo No matter what website 
len ratingtwo It always crashes and tells me to reload 
len ratingtwo When I m not on WiFi it takes forever to load webpages and it s not my data safari always loads with no problems when chrome isn t working 
len ratingfive Google chrome is amazing 
len ratingfive Whatever I search it gives me a good answer very quickly 
len ratingfive Those people who give this app a bad rating is a person with to high of expectation for you own good or is just simply a spoiled brat 
len ratingfive So if you didn t give this app a star rating is one of those and I wanna kill you all 
len ratingfive Get it got it good 
len ratingfive Google chrome has ZERO flaws and is just strait up AMAZING 
len ratingfive Who ever made this is a GENIUS 
len ratingfive Regards NotGonnaTellYou
len ratingone Ever since the last update Chrome doesn t work 
len ratingone It crashes every time I click on it won t even open 
len ratingone Bring back the old G search button at the bottom 
len ratingone Hate it being a new tab button now 
len ratingone I am very disappointed with the latest update why is the new tab button on the bottom 
len ratingone It functioned better when it was a search button 
len ratingone I can press that new tab button over a times and it will just create new tabs 
len ratingone I cant do that on desktop why on earth would i need that function on mobile 
len ratingtwo it does its job but not good it always closes tabs by itself and when you haven t gone on them for a few days have fun trying to find what you had up
len ratingone i can t watch Netflix party i have the app downloaded and it keeps telling me to download 
len ratingfour The latest update changed the oval G search button on the bottom of each tab to a that now opens a new tab 
len ratingfour The search button was so helpful as my thumb cant reach the search bar that is more than halfway up the screen 
len ratingfour Please change this back to the G search as I used it so often 
len ratingfour Other than that its a solid app 
len ratingtwo Disappointed in most recent update 
len ratingtwo Used to be able to have tabs open and it was rock solid 
len ratingtwo Now crashes refreshes glitches etc all of the time 
len ratingfour Works almost every time 
len ratingfour It is helpful and I would recommend it for you 
len ratingfive Please acknowledge your screw up in this case 
len ratingfive My order was placed today for two sandwiches at O Neils sandwich shop on Bethel CT Grubhub never fulfilled the transaction although they did charge my credit card on the Amt of Inelieve there was fraud involved in this transaction and I am filling a complaint with VISA against grubhub
len ratingfour Ok this app doesn t take forever to load and I never gets ads 
len ratingfour Google Chrome is good but there are two tiny problems First it clicks the wrong things accidentally When I looked up smiling puppies I press cute but then it thought I pressed original then the scariest thing showed up That annoys me so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much but I can deal with that Two my worst enemy AUTOCORRECT 
len ratingfour  Something I know is that Autocorrect hates me and it messes with everything I try to type Once I typed to my friend oh uhm but it turned into oh yummy HOW D THAT HAPPEN YOU ASK 
len ratingfour  AUTOCORRECT Now it affects me on Google Chrome too It would be a dream come true if Google Chrome could fix this please I LOVE GOOGLE CHROME 
len ratingone You cant use turbo tax with the new google
len ratingone Can t turn off safe search no matter what I do
len ratingthree I liked it better when the search button was on the bottom tab
len ratingone  Updated and the new update stopped syncing from my iOS only 
len ratingone I did not expect such inconvenience way of using chrome tab sync in between devices for years as daily browser 
len ratingfive Easy fast and reliable
len ratingtwo Whatever update that just removed the search button in the middle on the bottom is terrible used to be able to open the app and search easily with one hand 
len ratingtwo After enjoying that for a little while and losing it it s frustrating to use 
len ratingone Why move the new tab icon to the middle where you once could tap to move the focus to the search bar 
len ratingtwo In the old version you would press the and your cursor would already be in the search bar 
len ratingtwo Now you have to press and then tap again to go in the search bar 
len ratingtwo Why did they do this 
len ratingone Chrome replaced it s super convenient one click search button at the bottom of the app with a button that adds a new tab instead 
len ratingone It s way less efficient 
len ratingone Poor design change 
len ratingone Changed the stupid search thing on the bottom to a stupider new tab button like now there s ways to open a new tab on the bottom but no way to get to the search url bar from the bottom what kind of sense does that make change it back ffs
len ratingfour Please bring back the search button 
len ratingfour Replacing it with the is super confusing and I m constantly opening new tabs when I want to search something 
len ratingfour I looove Chrome but this is frustrating 
len ratingfour It s not bad But sometimes it s very slowly to use 
len ratingfour Chrome is useful when you automatically find Google software easier than Apple or you just prefer it more 
len ratingone Instead of adding a new tab button put the search button back where it was before
len ratingone Are you aware how much this app crashes and deletes your tabs 
len ratingone It s quite infuriating if it keeps on happening multiple times 
len ratingone I wish u sue this app or the idiotic team that handles it FIX IT it s quite disappointing how far this app had gone down in these years 
len ratingtwo It would be so much better if you add dark mode It is necessary at nights
len ratingfour  PLEASE bring back the search bar button on the bottom again it was REALLY helpful than moving back up to the top 
len ratingfour The Search Google button at the bottom of the browser was so helpful please bring it back 
len ratingtwo Change back the center button to instantiate a new search NOT to open up a new tab 
len ratingtwo Why did you change this 
len ratingtwo Extremely buggy and no desktop browsing by default option for iPads
len ratingone So sluggish now and why take the search box from the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone It was so much more convenient when using the phone with one hand 
len ratingthree Definitely a must if you re a frequent user of Google s apps suite it ll make life easier 
len ratingthree However the lack of customization from Google means you re at the mercy of every new update they spin out 
len ratingthree Compared with the browser application there s no user choice over button funtion theme or any other settings 
len ratingthree It s as simple as they are willing to make it 
len ratingone The recent change that removed the G oogle icon from the bottom of the page and instead places a new tab button has been the worst of the Chrome updates so far 
len ratingone After being used to just being able to hit G to begin searching for something I end up with unwanted open tabs because my instincts remain to use it as starting a search 
len ratingone Personally recommend you guys leave new tab in the tabs section and return the Google button in its place 
len ratingfive  I just downloaded this to play Dinosaur game but it is more than that that s it SERIOUSLY 
len ratingthree I just got used to touching the G at the bottom of the browser to start a new search 
len ratingthree That G has been changed to a plus symbol to open a new tab 
len ratingthree I think it is a useless feature 
len ratingthree The G that was there before was awesome 
len ratingthree You just press that and start typing what you want to search for 
len ratingthree Now it is clunky at best and useless if you only have one hand free to type with 
len ratingthree Bring back the G please 
len ratingtwo Chrome used to be my go to browser but the iPad app is now full of bugs 
len ratingtwo Lots of everyday websites e g 
len ratingtwo CNN are repeatedly crashing and it loses the tabs that I had open 
len ratingtwo Hopefully they ll get the glitches worked out soon 
len ratingfour Why did they get rid of the simple search feature where you touch near the bottom of the screen it was great please bring it back or have it as a option 
len ratingone Why would you change the bottom middle button from search to add a new tab and not have an option to keep it as a search button 
len ratingone People have gotten used to it already 
len ratingone The most recent update has taken away the search bubble at the bottom of the app and replaced it with a new tab button 
len ratingone This slows browsing ability considerably and instead results in muscle memory opening tons of new tabs 
len ratingone Put it back 
len ratingfive Google chrome works really well for me because I have to do online school and when I search the site it has no problems 
len ratingfive I really recommend this app for people who have to do online school
len ratingone Now my finger has to move extra length to click the address bar
len ratingone Love this browser but rating one star for the sheer reason that they got rid of the search button and replaced it with a new tab button 
len ratingone Just a total idiot move 
len ratingthree This kinda messed up the way I use the app I don t wanna open a new tab I just wanna search 
len ratingthree Would appreciate if you added an option to choose 
len ratingtwo The app is alright it s just when I m on the computer it s always crashing and I mean come on it s supposed to be the best of the best or so I was told
len ratingfour It s fine it s just i don t like that they changed the bottom middle button from the search to a new page button 
len ratingfour It s inconvenient 
len ratingtwo I absolutely hate the new open new tab button at the bottom of my browser 
len ratingtwo I love chrome and i loves the old one literally a day ago before i updated where it was just a shortcut to the search bar 
len ratingtwo I really hope it will go back
len ratingone I hate that the button that used to put the cursor in the search bar now opens a new tab 
len ratingone It s way too far to reach up every time I want to search for something 
len ratingone Phones are really big now 
len ratingthree Love Chrome 
len ratingthree Always have 
len ratingthree Started back on the original Android phone the T Mobile G and have been with Android until about a week ago 
len ratingthree Decided to try Apple 
len ratingthree Really like the iPhone 
len ratingthree Was glad to see Chrome available in the App Store 
len ratingthree But one of the main reasons I liked the app since using it on this phone has just disappeared 
len ratingthree A detailed way to get this feature back is what I m looking for 
len ratingtwo Please bring back the magnifying glass at the bottom instead of just opening a new page
len ratingone This update make a big mess 
len ratingone Most of the time we open the app to search for something one action as it was after the update was perfect 
len ratingone Bring this feature back 
len ratingone  I absolutely cannot stand the new update 
len ratingone I ve barely used google since it happened and I can t tell you how many times I ve tried to click the button at the bottom and instead opened a new tab 
len ratingone It s inconvenient and was much easier the other way 
len ratingone please bring back the original search bar shortcut instead of an new tab function there are already so many ways to add a new tab my stupid hand cramps up when i have to reach for the search bar ls i hate it here 
len ratingone Replacing the search button with a new tab is a terrible mistake 
len ratingtwo  The best thing about this over safari was having the search button at the bottom of the phone 
len ratingtwo This update replaces it with a for a new tab 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo These phones are huge 
len ratingtwo Having the search button at the bottom was perfect 
len ratingtwo Please reverse this update or give us the option to change it 
len ratingone The most recent update is terrible 
len ratingone I find the replacement of the search button on the bottom bar to a new tab button abysmal 
len ratingone I find it to be unnecessary and it should not have changed 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone  Otherwise I love google chrome 
len ratingtwo Bring back the google search button 
len ratingone As a UX Designer it s so difficult for me to see such a major design change happen in the app 
len ratingone The search used to be in the middle of the bottom nav bar but now it s replaced with a icon for a new tab 
len ratingone Every time I want to change the address for my page or search for something on google I end up opening new tabs instead 
len ratingone Can we please revert to the original and better bottom nav design 
len ratingthree The little search bar on the bottom of the screen was my favorite feature 
len ratingthree It was right by my thumbs unlike other browsers who only have it at the top 
len ratingthree Please put it back 
len ratingthree  I was casually using Chrome today when I noticed the Search button that is so easily accessible at the bottom of the screen has been replaced with a New Tab button 
len ratingthree I did not enjoy seeing a new tab open instead of me being able to type my search 
len ratingthree Please bring it back 
len ratingthree It was one of my favorite features 
len ratingthree I m so used to the middle button at the bottom to taking me to the search box but now it s been replaced with a button to create a new tab all of a sudden 
len ratingthree Super annoying and was not a good change that was a very convenient location to have the search button 
len ratingtwo This has a good UI 
len ratingtwo no need to have changed it to make it less convenient 
len ratingtwo Leaving this review in the hopes of them fixing this the search button is no longer on the bottom of the screen as shown in the pictures instead it s been replaced with an add tab button 
len ratingtwo Maybe it s dumb but this was the only reason I was using chrome ios instead of firefox and now it s gone 
len ratingtwo Tried seeing if I could fix it in settings but that doesn t seem to be an option 
len ratingtwo Why would you do this
len ratingfour Very good browser but I wish they would just make going from your pc tabs to your phone seamless and for the search button to be on the bottom of the new tab again instead of a useless new tab button at the bottom of your new tab 
len ratingthree With the las IPad iOS update all of my apps especially Google chrome randomly crashes 
len ratingthree I work on my iPad so I have to fill out forms very fast or start over multiple times Please please please counter fix this
len ratingone  I would never use MD Air conditioning again 
len ratingone He got very upset when I asked him to get a permit got very rude talking a whole lot of nonsense 
len ratingone Inspector had to make him put another slab for the outside unit 
len ratingone I would never recommend him 
len ratingone Actually I used another AC company to replace another AC and they were completely satisfactory 
len ratingfive i use this to watch prom
len ratingfive  I like it very very much 
len ratingfive  Safari browser does not always have the right navigation page 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is quicker and easier 
len ratingone Browser constantly freezes and crashes 
len ratingone Same goes for Google Maps 
len ratingone App is useless at times 
len ratingfive It always tells me what I want never had problems loading 
len ratingfive I love this app I had a project for school and I aced it because of the info that chrome gave me I l be chrome so much all of you should get it by the way chrome should be named awesomeness
len ratingfive  This is the best Better than safari It is pretty and well organized It never lagged and showed what you search I really like this app GOOGLE IS THE BEST 
len ratingfive GreAt to order nuggets
len ratingfive I luv it
len ratingfive I don t understand why I see so many negative comments about Chrome 
len ratingfive I use chrome daily it s really a lifesaver thanks a bunch 
len ratingone All browsers on iOS use the WebKit engine the same engine as Safari 
len ratingone So by using Chrome you re actually using Safari with Google s spyware installed on top of it 
len ratingone Congratulations 
len ratingtwo I wanted to have chrome on my phone at the beginning I loved the app however overtime every so often chrome will randomly delete all of my tabs and just restart 
len ratingtwo I lose all the tabs and things I wanted to save 
len ratingtwo Fix this 
len ratingtwo It is so frustrating 
len ratingthree  Features are on point and obviously chrome is still king on the laptop 
len ratingthree Almost no choice but to use it on mobile if you re a desktop user 
len ratingthree However the battery drain is significantly greater than safari even on the iPhone Pro 
len ratingthree To an unacceptable level 
len ratingthree  I think the app is nice but needs work 
len ratingthree I was looking up pictures and I couldn t find the one I needed 
len ratingone I m getting popus on sites that shouldnt have popups they dont go to the website i am going to only certain sites do this from google searches i have no idea whats going on 
len ratingone I have u installed the app multiple times and it continues to do this 
len ratingfive Just put the webpages I subscribed under the search path and let I decide what it should be it seems that it is randomed please 
len ratingfour But my mom deleted it because I was watching stuff like how people pee
len ratingthree  Google Chrome why is it all of a sudden today I can t log into my Yahoo account 
len ratingthree it keeps giving me a message saying the app is not secure 
len ratingthree Where are my notifications 
len ratingone Chrome used to be decent however nowadays on an ipad it is bloated slow buggy ad riddled slop 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingthree Google please make a desktop version of chrome for iPad OS 
len ratingthree Some website require chrome or Firefox only and the current app does not work well on the sites
len ratingfive Really good but slower than some other apps 
len ratingfour I think Google Chrome is the best Internet provider that is I m very happy with it
len ratingone  Completely unreliable on iOS because if you forget an load a pdf webpage OOPS 
len ratingone You ve just crashed Chrome and you ll need to reload your pages 
len ratingone Sometimes they reload sometimes they don t 
len ratingone And Google INC will always have better data available to them than you will as to what your open pages were 
len ratingone Google s Chrome is just another way for the company to track everything you do online and sell that data for advertising 
len ratingone Web pages frequently load slowly but in return for that you get the luxury of having adverts shoved in your face 
len ratingone BUY THINGS 
len ratingone NOW 
len ratingone Sometimes these ads will crash Chrome as well 
len ratingone Maybe it s more secure than other browsers but it s not secure from their data vacuuming 
len ratingone Back in the day Chrome was really the only alternative to IE but now there are lots of quite frankly better choices 
len ratingone I like DDG a lot 
len ratingone But if you like a lack of privacy and constant tracking and instability the this is your browser 
len ratingthree I love how everything works 
len ratingthree That being said many times when trying to search or load anything s i frequently get a problem in that it is unable to load 
len ratingthree Even after loading it a few times it doesn t work 
len ratingtwo I can t download it on my iPad for some reason could you please help 
len ratingtwo I ve seen many tutorials that include chrome but I cannot use them if you could help me with this I would be happy to send a good review 
len ratingfive  Nice
len ratingfive  Stup all support
len ratingone  If it ain t broke don t fix it really applies here 
len ratingone My chrome app before the update was perfectly fine 
len ratingone But now many pages won t load pages that are PDFs keeps buffering and every time you leave the app all previous opened pages are gone 
len ratingthree  I understand that under the hood on iOS all browsers are exactly the same Apple forces everyone to use the same WebKit rendering engine that Safari uses 
len ratingthree The only reason you d want to install alternative browsers on iOS is for other features like tab or history sync 
len ratingthree The Chrome browser for iOS falls short of stars because it requires you to request desktop version of every site on iPad or iPad Pro rather than default to it like Safari does since 
len ratingthree The user interface could also maybe be more thoughtful in not eating up so much real estate on a tablet which while a larger screen still is a premium 
len ratingthree I think Safari handles this better right now also 
len ratingthree So all in all it s an average star experience for me until they make the improvements I mentioned 
len ratingfive Love 
len ratingfive It 
len ratingone its a hell to get my stored passwords i m switching to other browser
len ratingtwo  Still no dark mode and can t use side by side on an iPad like safari 
len ratingfour This showing up off and on recently while writing an email 
len ratingfour i saw online google has had the problem off and on for at least a year 
len ratingfour why 
len ratingfour of late i deleted app and reloaded it from icloud but wonder if i m just reloading same problem 
len ratingfour iphone 
len ratingone Won t stay open long enough to fill a bug report
len ratingfive Excellent for watching ear rape
len ratingone  Can each porn
len ratingone Something went wrong
len ratingthree It is good but you can t search all stuff like if I want to search up something I did not work that is what I had to give it a star but moreover then everything is fine
len ratingone App constantly crashing won t load or stay on a page longer than two minutes
len ratingfour No chrome store
len ratingtwo Never thought id see the day i write this review 
len ratingtwo Google is now incompetent its time to jump ship 
len ratingtwo Clunky dysfunctional ui 
len ratingtwo Cant show me a frigging picture is insisting on going to a webpage the image is not on search results are hardly relevant features extensions and programs loosing support this is a sinking ship 
len ratingfive  Great app 
len ratingone This browser is sluggish and not secure they track everywhere you go on the web using their browser and it s overall very slow
len ratingone It s not on my iPad
len ratingtwo There is no way to change or access advanced settings like in the pc version and
len ratingthree  Please have the pop up blocker work because its quite useless and please have an option to use an ad blocker because the ads are very annoying
len ratingone  Just total useless crap like most mobile we browsers 
len ratingone Hopefully one day somebody will make a mobile web browser worth using 
len ratingone IMO It s kinda shocking stupid just how truly awful and pointless these wads of crappy code are 
len ratingone But that seems to be the industry standard total crap that serves no point and at best wast time and tips over itself as if the developers never considered what a mobile device is or how it could be used 
len ratingone Google would be wise to trash this software until they are ready to actually put out something useful 
len ratingfour I m rating this a four because I m sure this app is great but I don t know if I m doing something wrong or there s something wrong with the chrome because I just got the app I went into the app agreed to the terms and policies and then the next page said to chose your account so I logged into my account and pressed the button saying this is me or something like that and then it just kept on loading I tried multiple times but it just won t work Help please 
len ratingone Constantly crashes 
len ratingone Can t get on any page for more than seconds 
len ratingone AVOID
len ratingone  Oh snap 
len ratingone Something went wrong Rename your app this because I see it so often that it has rendered Chrome useless 
len ratingone Why can I be sitting for full minutes waiting for Chrome to load a simple search and then error but I can use Safari and have my results in seconds 
len ratingone The last few versions of this app have been slowing it down to a ridiculous rate 
len ratingone I installed Chrome when Safari went bad and now Chrome is nearly unusable between not loading freezing locking up my phone as a whole etc maybe spend a few less seconds focusing on shoving ads in my face and more time making a usable app 
len ratingone I mean doesn t everybody just want all the ads to load in a page before it shows you the article 
len ratingone Doesn t everybody celebrate when the page won t load because a single ad crashed out 
len ratingone Man how the mighty Alphabet keeps falling 
len ratingone Get some real devs for a change and regain your status 
len ratingone When you are worse than Safari a known joke of a browser you have failed hard 
len ratingfive Just some bug fixes and it s the best
len ratingtwo Recent version crashes almost every time since updating on inch iPad Pro making it unusable 
len ratingtwo Chrome is my number one browser of choice but I ve had to switch back to Safari until this is fixed 
len ratingfive Private browsing works perfect
len ratingfive I just use Crome for the Crome dinasour game
len ratingthree GC is a decent browser and my go to app for surfing onPC and iOS 
len ratingthree Keeps everything synced between platforms 
len ratingthree My only real complaint is it s lack of OneDrive capability 
len ratingthree I have to keep copying links to Safari to save a file for local use on my devices 
len ratingfive You thought I was going to say Goat didn t you 
len ratingtwo Aw snap I decided to wean myself of this browser by uninstalling it 
len ratingtwo I love the PC version 
len ratingtwo But the iPad version crashes a lot lately when viewing pages that have video content usually many ads 
len ratingtwo I ve been using it for years 
len ratingtwo But something went wrong with the current iOS release and now chrome gives a frequent Aw Snap 
len ratingtwo Making it unusable 
len ratingtwo I ll be reading a news website that has video based ads and Aw snap I reload and minutes later Aw snap 
len ratingtwo I ve cleared the cache cleared the cookies restarted reinstalled blah blah blah 
len ratingtwo It don t work 
len ratingtwo Ugh 
len ratingtwo Safari here I come 
len ratingfive It s Great 
len ratingthree The only thing that holds this browser from perfection is that stupid laggy search keyboard 
len ratingthree Please add extensions to the mobile version 
len ratingthree The whole reason I am using chrome is I need the extensions to run my business on my new IPad Pro 
len ratingthree I really need them and may have to resort to my desktop again 
len ratingthree Which makes running my business very difficult because I can t be mobile 
len ratingone You need to fix this without suggesting it s my device 
len ratingone I did all the steps and it still does it 
len ratingone Piece of junk my safari much better deleted chrome off all my system iPhone XR and iPad 
len ratingone Never seen anything that could run google be do badly made 
len ratingone Can t reach the web page 
len ratingfive I had to install it again because it was crashing
len ratingone  There is a critical issue in Google Chrome It keeps crashing 
len ratingone Why can I switch user accounts 
len ratingone Who made this poor excuse of a web browser
len ratingfive  Still a good browser
len ratingfour Thx
len ratingfive POOOOP
len ratingfive I don t have this app on my iPad
len ratingone Goodbye back to Safari 
len ratingfour I like to browse on this web but I have some ideas Idea list 
len ratingfour Changing the background with customize button Sketchup for iPhone iPad if you search dog or cat it will show a dog and cat breed list and if you choose one it will be put on the background That s it have a nice day Google
len ratingfive It is perfect it helps you when you need it and has accurate answers to what you searching up you should definitely use this app
len ratingtwo Used google ever since I made my email which was many years ago 
len ratingtwo They give your information out to who knows who when I read news articles 
len ratingtwo This new terms of service coming in March is going to let even more people have your information 
len ratingtwo I read an article about authorities looking in you emails 
len ratingtwo I understand this helps prevent cyber crime but has google already given out so much private information about everyone already 
len ratingtwo Time to switch browsers 
len ratingtwo Don t want people getting my online bank information or my college loan payments unless they pay it all off 
len ratingtwo Will miss you google 
len ratingone  It s so frustrating how it keeps on deleting all my tabs 
len ratingone I want to Downgrade back to the last version 
len ratingone Before version due to new browser capability called ScrollToTextFragment 
len ratingone This is deep linking technology tied to website text but multiple sources have revealed it is a potentially invasive privacy feature 
len ratingone We should be notified on things like this and from what I have read I will pass 
len ratingone If you guys can let me know how how to downgrade I would appreciate it 
len ratingtwo You guys really need to improve this 
len ratingtwo It feels like we still live in iOS generation 
len ratingone Owned iPhone c would received txt with photos of my great grandson I would tap photo and it went to my album on my phone 
len ratingone I could see pics and if I wanted send the new photos to my friend Now have iPhone and can t do any of that 
len ratingone I don t want them to go to the cloud 
len ratingone Every so often I go to Costco or camera store or CVS and print them out and put them in my scrapbook 
len ratingone Anybody have a suggestion 
len ratingone Is because I have google Chrome if so I will cancel it 
len ratingone I am confused
len ratingfive Love how it syncs across ALL my devices 
len ratingfive I can use it with my laptop which is not an apple who can afford an apple 
len ratingfive Not me 
len ratingfive and everything syncs beautifully 
len ratingfive Recommended
len ratingfour Whenever I download a file in Chrome a PDF or a video file the download is finished but I can t seem to be able to export them to another app 
len ratingfour The Open In button at the bottom right corner just doesn t do anything at all 
len ratingone Can t open links in email or on Facebook this evening 
len ratingone Page won t load for a website I use all of the time 
len ratingone Restarted browser no change 
len ratingone Restarted iPad no change 
len ratingone Help 
len ratingfour  The text in required HTML input tags isn t aligned properly iPhone X 
len ratingfour I love using chrome and I have been using it for a while but I have switched back to Apple s Safari because of one main reason 
len ratingfour Reader View 
len ratingfour I love having that clean no clutter reader view that adapts to the system dark mode and makes it easier to read 
len ratingfour I think that if chrome would incorporate this I would switch back to it and be more likely to use it in the future 
len ratingfour But if you don t care about the reader view 
len ratingthree For some reason on the iPad it refreshes all the time 
len ratingthree Even when I switch to another app and switch back it acts like I have it set to log out and refresh everything 
len ratingthree Super annoying 
len ratingthree Works fine on my iPhone though 
len ratingfive Please give 
len ratingfive Me a password to my user name
len ratingfour  It is a great browser made by google 
len ratingthree it s 
len ratingthree Good
len ratingone Incognito does not work 
len ratingone When you go to gmail it leaves incognito And it does leaves the History on the Browser 
len ratingone You must manually remove the History From the Browser 
len ratingone From Jack
len ratingone  Terrible ui nothing like what I had in ny Android phone before switching to iPhone 
len ratingone Why does it have to look so different 
len ratingone Every other Google app looks just like their Android counterparts 
len ratingone I m all for consistency 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingtwo This is the second time the chrome browser closed all open tabs and removed it from the recent tab history after the update 
len ratingtwo It s really annoying and inconvenient 
len ratingtwo Really disappointed 
len ratingfour I was logging in to my google account and it said my account wasn t a thing I checked my account various times and it still wasn t working 
len ratingfour I have the latest updates and sent it my number 
len ratingfour It still didn t work 
len ratingfour I ve tried everything 
len ratingfour Fix tis for me please 
len ratingthree  Overall the app is great but how can you fail with the copy and paste feature 
len ratingthree I copy an item and then go try to paste it in the search and it flashes really quick and won t let me click it 
len ratingthree This is my biggest complaint 
len ratingthree So I copy in chrome and go back to safari to search 
len ratingthree You must be losing lots of money over such a simple fix 
len ratingthree I use this feature a lot hence is my reasoning for stars 
len ratingone Chrome on iOS unlike its android or pc versions is very hard to use 
len ratingone  It not compatible with IOS accessibility features for people with dysgraphia 
len ratingone  There are no config or chrome flags options to turn on accessibility 
len ratingone  There is very little webgl or extension support so it does not have compatibility with basic work arounds like using an extension or website that makes the web accessible for people with disabilities 
len ratingone  The current version broke links that launch apps 
len ratingone The same links that don t work in chrome work in safari
len ratingone I try to make an account and I put in my birthdate and it s so stupid that it thinks it not a valid date
len ratingone I m trying to log into my email account but no matter how many times I try to reset my password it keeps telling me that it can t verify me as the owner of the address 
len ratingone I feel like crying and throwing my phone against the wall 
len ratingone This is so frustrating 
len ratingone Why is it so hard to reset a password 
len ratingone Why does it not believe me to be the owner of the account 
len ratingfive Never lets me down great search engine
len ratingfour This is a great app but the google news homepage is just way too distracting
len ratingfive The incognito mode screenshot shows surprise and vacation instead of porn 
len ratingone I ve been unable to download the latest version
len ratingtwo It used to work great and I have used Google since the beginning 
len ratingtwo However the iPhone and iPad apps have gone way down hill 
len ratingtwo My biggest problem is that my history no longer syncs across my devices 
len ratingtwo You wouldn t think such a large company couldn t afford to or wouldn t want to fix such a simply problem 
len ratingfive you know we all use this for porn anyway
len ratingtwo When pulling down to refresh it seems to close the tab 
len ratingtwo Can you disable the feature when pulling down for it to move right or l red ft to close the tab
len ratingone  Browser constantly freezes and crashes 
len ratingone Same goes for google maps 
len ratingone App is useless
len ratingone I cannot find how to access advanced settings to enable cookies 
len ratingone I looked up directions on how to do it and they are in accurate 
len ratingone No matter where I look or scroll I cannot access the option 
len ratingone Utter bs 
len ratingthree It s killing my battery whenever i open it it overheats my iPad 
len ratingtwo This would probably be the best browser once it supports desktop sites and downloads 
len ratingtwo Let s go google it s freggin 
len ratingtwo You re holding back my iPad Pro 
len ratingfive This is the best web browser I have ever used and others have calmed to be better than this one and also said they were faster but no not true 
len ratingfive There s nothing that compares to Chrome 
len ratingone As we know chrome is famous for and succeeded for its wide variety of extensions but after the version google tried to eliminate this kind of variety 
len ratingone They warn you every time when you open browser if not using an official extension using an extension not from chrome store due to some safety concerns 
len ratingone This is ridiculous since most of the unsafe unofficial extensions are open source projects on Github but the so called safe ones are the ones we really know nothing about 
len ratingone Google is trying to hold everything in their hand even extensions like a freaking big brother 
len ratingone You may wonder why I m talking about the PC version here well if I could ever find a chance to review the PC version I will give them star for their Soviet union like controlling over everything 
len ratingfive Best app
len ratingtwo No fats
len ratingfive One time when I played the snake game I found out it had new colors to the snake and it would affect your gameplay 
len ratingfive If you play as yellow you can t even die as yellow 
len ratingfive But playing dinosaur chrome on mobile it has no sound except the computer version 
len ratingfive Can you give dinosaur chrome mobile can you give it sound too 
len ratingfive It is GOOD for porn
len ratingone Over the last few weeks Chrome crashes on startup and loses the tabs I had opened 
len ratingtwo When auto populating my search entry in incognito mode 
len ratingtwo I m not really incognito anymore 
len ratingfour After IOS update in December I got tired of Safari crashing or not rendering web page after update 
len ratingfour Chrome is not perfect but better than Safari at this point in time 
len ratingfive Greatest macros and buttons 
len ratingfive Greatest search engines in the world 
len ratingfour  It s okay 
len ratingone I think I m going to have to delete chrome from my iPhone 
len ratingone All it ever does seconds after opening it is freeze 
len ratingone Very disappointed Hi Thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone Try the steps to solve crashes issues in this Help Center article 
len ratingone If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingthree Dont start videos until you can play them in normal speed 
len ratingthree  Hey there thanks for reaching out 
len ratingthree We have released an updated version of Chrome that resolves this behavior 
len ratingthree Check the latest update in our help community 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree Always liked chrome 
len ratingthree However the new update has caused crashing whilst viewing articles typically triggered via chrome browser as well 
len ratingone I am suddenly not able to view or use my passwords in the Google Chrome app my iPhone OR on the mobile webpage 
len ratingone It s telling me that it can t access it because of a passphrase i used to encrypt it 
len ratingone I am aware that I have a passphrase for encryption but I have never had this issue before 
len ratingone I have always been able to access my passwords in the Google Chrome app 
len ratingone This is a very big inconvenience 
len ratingone I currently keep password stored with Google and with the newest update chrome will not allow me to access any of the passwords I ve stored 
len ratingone It will just tell me the passwords that I ve told it to never store 
len ratingone This has happened with multiple features with chrome 
len ratingone Very unfortunate that they do this with updates whether they mean to or not 
len ratingone Lack of validation I suppose 
len ratingone I had been using it since I bought the IPad in Oct 
len ratingone Earlier this week it crashed about times and worked an hour then went kaplooey Could not figure out how to fix it did reset NOTHING so went in and uninstalled BEFORE finding it in the App Store showing I now need a newer operating system Mine is a amd it shows it now needs a SSSSOOOOOO NOT happy 
len ratingone Downloaded the Edge ok but not happy hate Foxfire and the other I tried so still looking 
len ratingthree  This app works great but there are a few kinks that need to be worked on
len ratingone I use to love google amp chrome but they ve been especially keen on restricting what I can see filtering my search results 
len ratingone I will be switching to Duck Duck Go 
len ratingfive  This is way better then Firefox edge or brave
len ratingtwo New chrome for turbo will not open on IPad
len ratingfour  Good enough but it keeps crashing on certain sites 
len ratingfour Im using iphone XR
len ratingone For the last month all of my tabs keep disappearing 
len ratingone I know have to use safari to not lose anything
len ratingthree The app constantly hangs when navigating to a new page or link where it can last from a few moments to several minutes 
len ratingthree It also tends to crash when you scroll down a page for too long 
len ratingthree The most irritating thing however is that it auto refreshes pages whenever you switch tabs or apps 
len ratingthree I don t know if it s worth continuing to use this browser on an iPhone 
len ratingone  Whenever I put any address and hit direction to that place and start driving google map used to update how many miles and time left to the destination and show gray line passed route 
len ratingone That s one the biggest reason I use google maps 
len ratingone But last weeks it s not updating time and distance 
len ratingone It s working the same as Apple Maps 
len ratingone I ve tried to log out and back in delete the app and install back 
len ratingone It didn t fix the problem 
len ratingone I really need to fix it 
len ratingone One star is just for getting attention It ll be updated
len ratingone Only way to load a tab is to go back and forth between tabs 
len ratingone This app that I m using is the only browser that overheats my phone and it drops my battery percentage every second 
len ratingone Not cool not cool 
len ratingone I love google but don t make me use another browser 
len ratingfour Just use brave tho 
len ratingfour It has built in ad block
len ratingone This app has lost its luster 
len ratingone What started out as the best browser has turned into one of the worst 
len ratingone It s almost too laggy to use 
len ratingthree Lately Chrome for iPhone has been crashing a lot 
len ratingthree I already had to delete gboard for iPhone because the keys would stick 
len ratingthree It s as if you guys have lost the technology edge you once had 
len ratingone Please add confirmation for the close all tabs button 
len ratingone I know I shouldn t have tabs open but I also feel like the Close All Tabs button is entirely too close to the New Incognito Tab button 
len ratingone Edit I m an idiot and did it again 
len ratingone Yes it s my fault 
len ratingone Removing another star nonetheless 
len ratingone Edit Thanks for moving the Close All button be better if confirmation was added 
len ratingone However not adding any stars back because everything else about this update is awful 
len ratingone Edit Did it again One star 
len ratingone  This cringe worthy company tracks e writhing from location data to browsing history to clicks on pages 
len ratingone I ll never trust y all again 
len ratingone You or Fakebook I meant Facebook or Shytter I meant Twitter 
len ratingone Y all are pure evil as is capitalism and human capital all together 
len ratingone Stop trying to monetize people s lives and spreading false information it corrupts people s minds and destroys elections in the most powerful country in the World USA Freedom World Peace Amen 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingthree The auto refresh is really annoying 
len ratingthree If I m in the middle of a super long article and I go check the weather app and come back the page will automatically refresh and I ll be at the top of the page 
len ratingthree Chrome for my Android phone doesn t do this at all 
len ratingthree I can be on a story for weeks and it never refreshes unless I restart the phone 
len ratingfour  Sometimes when I m in Incognito mode 
len ratingfour When in app switcher mode on my phone it doesn t hide the page I m currently on 
len ratingone Please work on Dark Mode on Google Chrome app and everything other app for iPad Pro Generation 
len ratingone IPadOS already have Dark Mode 
len ratingone Extension support for Dark Reader I hate too bright light mode hurt my eyes to read 
len ratingthree It is really goood app but it not better then google
len ratingone  One star due to no ad blocker being included with the app 
len ratingone The update to make suggested sites bookmarked items viewable in incognito mode for easy access doesn t work 
len ratingone Staying with safari until the simple things are added fixed with chrome 
len ratingone It says that the app is no longer shared with me I have to buy it from the App Store yet when I go to the App Store it says open google but I can t bc its no longer shared with me
len ratingfive Goof
len ratingfive  I m originally an Android user so this is my original browser but even on this iPhone it s amazing as ever 
len ratingfive I would recommend it highly 
len ratingfive  G ooooooose nose TASTY yes BIG BIGGER BIGGEST HAHAHAHA
len ratingfive Easy and Fast
len ratingthree This app is cool but I can t switch between my google accounts which is pretty frustrating 
len ratingone In do not like this because you are not allowed to download it
len ratingone For some reason whenever i type in Korean chrome breaks them up 
len ratingone Expected typed result Actual typed result Since Korean character needs to assemble consonants and vowels above will never make sense 
len ratingone In more extreme cases gt gt This bug existed since ios beta and i thought it was ios bug until i started using safari instead 
len ratingone Quick google search reveals that this is wide spread issue in Korean community and many bug reports have been filed but it has not been patched yet 
len ratingthree Plz
len ratingthree  I currently keep password stored with Google and with the newest update chrome will not allow me to access any of the passwords I ve stored 
len ratingthree It will just tell me the passwords that I ve told it to never store 
len ratingthree This has happened with multiple features with chrome 
len ratingthree Very unfortunate that they do this with updates whether they mean to or not 
len ratingthree Lack of validation I suppose 
len ratingone Images freeze on screen when enlarged 
len ratingfive  Please fix the sync issue on iOS 
len ratingfive I don t have open tabs sync problem on my other device such as my Mac Android phone and my Windows computer I only have issue with ios and later 
len ratingfive Which mean also affect iPad is 
len ratingfour  Please include cast feature in this app
len ratingone I usually have open about tabs 
len ratingone I use private tabs because I don t want to clutter my browser with cookies 
len ratingone The problem is when the chrome crashes unexpectedly it brings down all the private tabs with it 
len ratingone This never happens with Safari or Firefox 
len ratingone Simply inexcusable 
len ratingone I would give it stars if I could 
len ratingthree Bring support and multi space to chrome it would make more useful and feel like a better web browser
len ratingfour  Easy to use and fast download speed 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingone Periodically app will crash and tabs will be lost 
len ratingone I m not aware that recent versions have any failsafe mechanisms but I m hoping this becomes an option 
len ratingone edit Dropped from stars to 
len ratingone Same issue 
len ratingone Needs beyter undo and recovery options for tabs 
len ratingone I ve been meaning to switch to Firefox and now is the time 
len ratingone Latest update isn t allowing users to access our website on mobile 
len ratingone Only when using incognito mode or deleting cookies will it work 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingone New design is very ugly will either find a way to change it or switch browsers 
len ratingone I m tired of google forcing ads 
len ratingone If your going to make money off me make sure I get some 
len ratingthree I love google chrome 
len ratingthree Never really had a problem until today 
len ratingthree The app on my iPhone keeps crashing 
len ratingthree I ve closed all the tabs on the app 
len ratingthree I ve closed other apps because maybe I had too many open 
len ratingthree I updated my phone 
len ratingthree I have also restarted my phone 
len ratingthree It s not my phone because any other app I use is perfectly fine 
len ratingone  Constantly f ing crashing 
len ratingone I have used Chrome as my one and only web browser for years 
len ratingone As of yesterday it freezes and crashes within seconds of being used 
len ratingone It is absolutely unusable in its current state 
len ratingone Figure it out 
len ratingfive I use it
len ratingtwo Lots of messages not responding Show searches
len ratingone Why would you consent to being spied on by one of the richest corporations in the world 
len ratingone Delete this crap immediately 
len ratingone  ios

len ratingthree  I think Google Chrome is a great browser 
len ratingthree It syncs all of my tabs and bookmarks across all my devices while having a simplistic and enjoyable web browsing experience 
len ratingthree However as someone who primarily uses an iPad Pro for most of my work it would be really nice if Google could follow suit with Apple in the sense that Safari now supports full desktop browsing with its own download manager 
len ratingthree Would be really nice to see this feature come to Chrome as it is basically the only thing keeping me from using this as my default browser on my iPad 
len ratingthree If this feature were added I would be sold on using this as my primary browser 
len ratingthree However I still feel as though Safari integrates so much better into my workflow 
len ratingthree I hate having to request a desktop site all the time since mobile sites are the default on this device and since there is no way to change it there s no workaround and you must request a desktop site every single time sometimes the desktop sites aren t even supported 
len ratingthree I love the design of this application a lot and it s a shame that it has these limitations 
len ratingone If you want privacy use Brave Firefox Focus or Tor 
len ratingone Last few updates have rendered browser nearly unusable 
len ratingone Love this browser on iPad but will switch to Firefox if no improvement comes 
len ratingfive IT IS GOOD GET IT NOW 
len ratingtwo Accessing to bookmarks is way too inconvenient a 
len ratingtwo Needs too many clicks b Websites saved on bookmark bar cannot be saved on mobile device bookmarks 
len ratingone Garbage no need to use you phone memory for this 
len ratingone Please fire those who code this nonsense 
len ratingone Or go to India 
len ratingfive even notice the punches that youre throwing
len ratingone when it should be like it goes to everytime i type on the search bar
len ratingone Open tabs keep closing 
len ratingone They were up this morning heck even an hour ago 
len ratingone I come back and all my tabs are closed 
len ratingone This is the or th it s happend I hate using safari but at least my tabs won t get force closed in there like googles been doing 
len ratingone Google likes to follow the same path as Apple they like to fix things that aren t broken to begin with 
len ratingone Versions ago Google was unique and easy to use 
len ratingone Now it s just a cumbersome complicated difficult to use app and is now worse than Safari 
len ratingone And the bombardment of forced ads and news stories are ridiculous 
len ratingone I want to read a news story I will look for it 
len ratingone I don t need it forced down my throat 
len ratingone Hey Google are you reading my negative review and thousands like it 
len ratingone Of course not 
len ratingone You have become an overgrown corporate monster that cares nothing about its customers and only about 
len ratingone I m going back to Safari 
len ratingone It s free 
len ratingone It s already on my phone 
len ratingone And Google hasn t given me one reason to stay but it s given me every reason to leave 
len ratingone  Great app
len ratingtwo The last bunch of versions of Chrome have been problematic with both usability and reliability suffering compared to prior versions 
len ratingtwo I never ever want to drag a link anywhere but that s what happens half the time I long press to get the open in new tab option 
len ratingtwo Speaking of tabs Chrome just lost all of my open ones again 
len ratingtwo Safari never has this problem it s still showing tabs I opened years ago and never closed 
len ratingtwo Chrome has been my daily driver for years but I m trying out other browsers now because its quality has dropped so far 
len ratingfive U can also watch porn unlike safari lol
len ratingfive perfect for Rick rolls 
len ratingfour I love google but the only thing is that there are some weird things on there 
len ratingfour Some of them are creepy 
len ratingfour I would love if you could feel x this 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo I have been a dedicated user of Chrome on all devices but I am going to stop on iPad 
len ratingtwo Enough is enough 
len ratingtwo Tabs just disappear and have been doing so for a few months lately more often 
len ratingtwo I tried searching for ways to stop that but can t find any 
len ratingtwo Google does not do anything to fix this 
len ratingone Why the app does not have the option to reopen recently closed tab 
len ratingone Went to chrome on my phone to watch videos and it s saying video unavailable 
len ratingone Play indicator is there but nothing is playing 
len ratingone I was able to use chrome one time this week and it isn t allowing the videos to be played 
len ratingfive  Porn
len ratingthree  Why is my background the word GOOGLE suddenly all black 
len ratingthree  someone keeps trying to hack into it 
len ratingfour not sure what to title this 
len ratingfour anyways I ve used google chrome for as long as I can remember and I got this app a while back and it worked flawlessly 
len ratingfour but for some reason now if I wanna search something I have to hit the search button like times for it to actually start searching same for the link I m wanting to open 
len ratingfour what s going on with that and how can I fix it 
len ratingfour I ve already deleted and redownloaded the app a few times and that didn t work
len ratingfour So I Was On YouTube And I Saw A Video On How To Change Your Background But The Chrome Web Store Only Supports Computers Please Make Chrome Web Store For Mobile Users Too Please I Use An IPad
len ratingone No Stadia support at all and no fully featured desktop browser like Safari is Safari is vastly superior now and obviously the best current choice on iPad 
len ratingone Keeps closing open pages 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingone App freezes quite often with no way to use UI widgets 
len ratingone  Hi Thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone Try the steps to solve freezing issues in this Help Center article 
len ratingone If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingtwo I would totally give this browser stars but it has one verylarg problem you can t browse without constantly reloading a page because it has a fit andsays oh snap 
len ratingtwo Then when you reload you have to find your place again 
len ratingtwo It ruins the browser 
len ratingfour  Well kalista court will have a series of legal meetings to evict and or sue many large and individual enitys with a Swiss irs laundry team to siege funds if they can t see the military complex of the us army Carlisle barracks
len ratingone  pro 
len ratingone  Chrome was great up until this past year 
len ratingone My tabs would keep mass closing with them not showing up in the recently closed tabs 
len ratingone It was frustrating when I had tabs that were open for months so I would have to search in my history to find them again 
len ratingone And google hasn t done anything to fix this glitch even though multiple people have complained 
len ratingone Finally got fed up after the th time it happened and switched to Firefox it s already so much better 
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingfour I just use this for porn
len ratingfive  This is the best browse for people iOS 
len ratingfive I love that it matches the dark mode in iOS which make it ideal for night 
len ratingfive It s even faster than the desktop version 
len ratingfive I recommend this browser 
len ratingone Incredible that the company the size of google can t make your username passwords sync across desktop and mobile 
len ratingone I just downloaded Brave and I m hoping it works out 
len ratingone The positive with Brave they don t egregious sell your data and build consumer profiles about your browsing and spending which they use for targeted advertising and other profit programs 
len ratingone  Very unstable after the newest iPad update constantly crashing may need to go back to Firefox
len ratingone  The design is awful 
len ratingone Feel of using Chrome on iPhone is also awful 
len ratingone Just change it 
len ratingone  Google is a monopoly and is evil 
len ratingone I lmreally love chrom based on how they have cooler open tab style pages but I m getting fed up of the app crashing every min amp getting the chrome shut down message Hi Thanks for reaching out

len ratingone If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive It is awesome more great than edge but never rate it 
len ratingfour How do I update the app 
len ratingone Cannot stand using this app anymore 
len ratingone Every time I open the app it asks me to download google device policy to install my work data 
len ratingone What google tells you in the fine print is that it now has access to literally all the data on your phone 
len ratingone No thanks 
len ratingone And I ve tried a million different ways to try and turn off the pop up and it still pops up every time I open the chrome app 
len ratingone  So privacy is not luxury to me it is I have a picture from your stuff I don t want and I will never use your services I don t care
len ratingone  I have used Google Chrome for years then I wondered I was agreeing to when Agreed to the terms of use an privacy policy 
len ratingone Google is a freaking stalker 
len ratingone Has ANYONE but me actually READ the privacy policy 
len ratingone They follow you everywhere with ads sell your information to the highest bidder and collect information on you on almost every website with their Google Tracking Network 
len ratingone And Google don t you dare tell me Google uses your information for a more personalized experience 
len ratingone We both know how a company famous for an entirely free service without the option to donate or upgrade account makes money 
len ratingtwo Wish the iOS app was the same as the android app 
len ratingtwo The android app is soo much better and more reliable 
len ratingtwo This one is not bad but could be so much better 
len ratingone  After a few minutes of use chrome freezes then shutdown 
len ratingone Constantly does this 
len ratingone My google chrome keeps crashing and it is updated

len ratingfive  bdbdbdbdbbdbdgx
len ratingfive Y all know why it s good duh star
len ratingfive Google Chrome is the web browser that all other web browsers want to be when they grow up 
len ratingfive Except it s updated so often and kept so well that none of the other browsers even begin to compare 
len ratingfive Fastest smoothest coolest browser hands down 
len ratingfive And you can sync all your things across all devices 
len ratingfive Winning 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingthree Mobile devices can see desktop tab history but not each other iPhone and iPad 
len ratingthree Desktop cannot see any mobile device history whatsoever 
len ratingthree This is so annoying and time consuming and it has been unfixed for too long 
len ratingthree  Hey there 
len ratingthree Let s try the instructions in the Fix problems with sync section of this help center article 
len ratingthree If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingfour It s a pretty good browser but safari has a better download capability after iOS and also I think it has a pretty awful YouTube page 
len ratingfour I think safari even does YouTube better which is ironic given chrome is owned by Alphabet google which OWNES YouTube 
len ratingfour So how exactly does safari and apple product do YouTube better than YouTube s parent company 
len ratingfour I don t know but it s technically a pretty good browser 
len ratingfour LOVE the Steve the jumping dinosaur function I think it s great that it has a game offline standard to the browser so it s only that and the fact that I can erase my search history regardless of restrictions that it s getting stars from me instead of 
len ratingone Without enabling Chrome sync to any account it still uses my payment method for my Google account 
len ratingone I did not sync Chrome leaving the switch off 
len ratingone It must be reading the Gmail account under iPad account settings and syncing by itself to be helpful and assume I want my privacy ignored 
len ratingone STUPID GOOGLE amp CHROME 
len ratingone I don t want this on 
len ratingone But I can t prevent this from turning on except by deleting Chrome from iPad amp never using Chrome again 
len ratingfive more than good other app 
len ratingtwo Auto fill not working when searching for some reason 
len ratingtwo  Hey there 
len ratingtwo As a first step please review the information in this help center article 
len ratingtwo If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive Amaze balls
len ratingtwo No 
len ratingtwo please do NOT flash me depressing news or discoveries 
len ratingtwo I when I tap Chrome open I already have something to discover 
len ratingtwo And yes I did turned it off in the settings multiple times but it Keeps toggling itself back on 
len ratingone Not sure what happened 
len ratingone Use to be a great app but now it won t load or loads at the speed of smell 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingone  Hey there 
len ratingone As a first step please check that your device is connected to the Internet 
len ratingone You can learn more about fixing specific connection warnings here 
len ratingone If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be abl
len ratingfive  This is way better than safari because it loads my websites in under seconds with safari i was waiting minutes 
len ratingtwo  The chrome refresh has been great except recently the button to jump to the search bar has changed to new tab 
len ratingtwo This makes the button redundant and way less helpful 
len ratingtwo At least give us the option to change it 
len ratingfive AUDIO ISSUE Doesn t force the app to stay open when I m listening to an audio only page 
len ratingfive If this was fixed I would give you stars 
len ratingfour Great app overall but it won t appear on my home screen 
len ratingfour Not sure why 
len ratingthree I love using chrome on my phone and that I can send a link from one of my devices to another without saving it as a bookmark and finding it like as if I was playing that game called Where is Waldo 
len ratingthree but I would like it what my suggest is about so it can be easier for me to swap profiles between my home account and school account 
len ratingthree The suggestion that I think is going to be beneficial to everyone create an update where people on mobile that have chrome installed and has different gmail accounts and that people can just click swap profile just like on the computer and that the data would be in separate areas but won t be affected with combining them together and just call it a night 
len ratingone Since this past Saturday Jan my Chrome sessions continuously bomb every minutes 
len ratingone It s as if Google could care less that users have issues with their app 
len ratingone I have sent approx 
len ratingone  tickets with screen shot and dumps since Sunday 
len ratingone It is now Thursday and I haven t heard word one from Google about this is issue 
len ratingone I experienced the same issue a few months back as well 
len ratingone Chrome was THE go to browser on the market but has rapidly degraded on both the iOS amp Microsoft platforms over the past several years 
len ratingone It s a shame just don t bother with this app 
len ratingone It will crush your soul 
len ratingtwo First off I have used chrome for many years on my iPads and laptops and iPhones and I have always found it to be superior however Apple s new feature for Safari on iPadOS makes Chrome obsolete 
len ratingtwo With Safari you get automatic desktop websites without a catch 
len ratingtwo With Chrome if you want the desktop site you must go to the settings on each web page and manually request the desktop site for every single site you go to 
len ratingtwo If Chrome ads this same feature in for iPadOS I will go back to Chrome 
len ratingtwo As for now I am using Safari 
len ratingtwo  Hey there 
len ratingtwo Some websites don t support Chrome s request desktop version feature 
len ratingtwo You can see if the website has it s own option to select a desktop version or contact the website owner for more assistance 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingthree  Google chrome has always been on of my personal favorites 
len ratingthree This is a really solid app 
len ratingthree Only issue I have with the app is the virus pop ups that come with it 
len ratingthree Amazon spin the wheel 
len ratingthree Like go away 
len ratingthree Other then that awesome
len ratingthree Yeahyv yuh hbujvujj
len ratingthree  It s why does chrome for iPad have extensions yet like it does for PC 
len ratingthree Come on you guys should be able to do this already 
len ratingthree Stars go up when you make game changers improvements 
len ratingthree  Hi 
len ratingthree We wanted to follow up and confirm this feature has launched in the latest version of Chrome iOS on iOS 
len ratingthree Learn how to use Dark Mode here 
len ratingone Bruh
len ratingone On many websites I used to be able to click and hold to open a new tab 
len ratingone Now it just tries to highlight text 
len ratingone It s extremely irritating 
len ratingthree There is an option in duo which allows your device to be remembered day 
len ratingthree However chrome in iPad in unable to do so 
len ratingthree I am getting an error saying that I need enable cookies 
len ratingthree But the cookies are by default allowed 
len ratingthree This bug should be resolved 
len ratingthree Since the iOS update I have had an issue with being able to play audio from any website in the background while my screen is turned off 
len ratingthree Within about min of the screen turning off the audio ceases to play until I unlock my phone and hit the play button on the site again 
len ratingthree This makes it almost impossible to listen to any podcast without downloading the appropriate app or as I learned last night playing the audio in Safari 
len ratingthree I much prefer the UI in Chrome and rather be able to use it exclusively but as of now the only way for me to listen to most podcasts is by opening the site in Safari and playing it from there 
len ratingone Slow featureless long in the tooth 
len ratingone  what this do well it got more to do with the app at do nothing more than snitch and compromize your accounts 
len ratingfour  Bring Apps in multiple spaces to chrome pls so the work flow is better
len ratingtwo Constantly closes all my open windows 
len ratingtwo Then a week later closes the new windows iv opened and try s to re open the ones from a week ago telling me there was a malfunction 
len ratingone Cleaned up my history from the browser but still the autocomplete suggests sites and pages which were purged 
len ratingone Deleting and cleaning up browser history seems to be of no effect

len ratingone I hate google because they don t let you delete all your search I need to my boss might see the videos that don t want anybody see and of put a it shows it but I deleted it like why that still there I try download this doesn t work because my Apple ID password I DONT know LIKE WHYY AHHHHH
len ratingtwo No home button may be a deal breaker for me 
len ratingtwo New tab is an extra step 
len ratingtwo Dolphin is a better browser 
len ratingtwo As it is now one must close the tab and open a new tab just to get back to their google home page 
len ratingtwo Give us an option to go back to home without closing and opening a new tab 
len ratingfive It s real good 
len ratingthree And no content blocker support 
len ratingthree Big boo on you 
len ratingfive  Where s Chrome 
len ratingfive I m using chrome since I remember but I used other browsers to compare with chrome but they are not even close 
len ratingfive You can sync everything with chrome and it s fast I mean REAL fast 
len ratingfive and most important thing about chrome is it s secure and it blocks pop ups for you 
len ratingfive I mean it has everything you would need 
len ratingone It s and I have to tap bookmark and use a dialog box to pick a site 
len ratingone Menu bars have existed forever 
len ratingone Look at Safari 
len ratingone That s how a bookmark bar should function 
len ratingtwo  No fats
len ratingone Does not work with dark mode Hey there thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone Feel free to submit this feedback directly to our development team 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone Still works with everything else on iOS including Safari so pretty obvious it s chrome s problem 
len ratingfour I love this browser thank you or adding dark mode but we still need Adblock or let us enable Content blockers with other Adblock apps 
len ratingfour If chrome adds Adblock it would be the superior browser for sure
len ratingtwo I have been using this app for awhile and it seems to freeze constantly on web pages and completely shuts down 
len ratingone This app is now broken 
len ratingone It crashes with every use after just a few minutes 
len ratingone The help article provided by the developer in another recent review didn t seem to be any help 
len ratingone There are no error codes when it crashes 
len ratingone And its not because of too many tabs or needing a restart 
len ratingone I can have one tab open right after restarting and it will crash no matter the page I try 
len ratingone I ve pretty much given up on the browser and have to use Safari blech

len ratingfive It s a pretty nice browser 
len ratingfour I had some lag and some times does not let me look at my recents
len ratingone Autofill does not work majority of the time 
len ratingone I will be clicking on my information and it won t work 
len ratingone Also when I use autofill for credit card in Shopify it makes me autofill for every slot 
len ratingone One time for cc number again for name and again for exp date 
len ratingone Also for some cards it prompts me to enter my last three digits to verify even though I ve used the card on the browser already 
len ratingone And when I need to verify for every slot when autofilling my cc then I might as well enter it manually 
len ratingone I love not getting hit with captcha for using chrome but with all these set backs it s quicker to check out with safari 
len ratingone This is where safari outshines any browser 
len ratingone Their autofill is amazing 
len ratingone One click and it fill outs everything 
len ratingone Unfortunately chrome is the worst browser in the App Store 
len ratingone Even Firefox and opera autofill works better 
len ratingone Also the refresh on this browser is retarded 
len ratingone Because you need the scroll down to refresh and scroll down right to close the page it s very easy to accidentally close the page when trying to refresh 
len ratingone Does google not know it s very common for fingers to accidentally drift right or left while scrolling up and down 
len ratingone Also bookmarks are so inconvenient to access these things should be accessible with a click or two at the most 
len ratingone With safari I just click on the url as if I was gonna type in a new url and all my favorites show up right on the main page 
len ratingone This is honestly the most user unfriendly browser ever 
len ratingone The one good thing I ll say about chrome is how it keeps you on current page when opening a new tab 
len ratingone Every other browser switches to the new page when opening a tab and that s the one thing I love about iOS chrome but overall very crappy browser 
len ratingone Would not recommend 
len ratingfive  I can watch porn
len ratingtwo With this last update typing speed get terrible solve this terrible problem
len ratingone They Had Stolen My Data And Answers On YouTube 
len ratingone They Are The Culprit For Data Breaching YouTube 
len ratingone I Had Caught Them Red Handed Within Minutes 
len ratingone  Between the crashes and refreshes of every page I visit chrome has become a almost useless browser 
len ratingone I love google products but this has gone severely downhill I ve the last month or so

len ratingone Me hooks up hentai all sees is inappropriate stuff for kids I wanna sue u and u stalk pepole plz stop this I don t wanna see more or that hentai I really like YouTube but sorry pepole to sue u
len ratingone  Plagued with ads that make sites unusable 
len ratingone The google adblocker is a joke and allows all ads 
len ratingone Even full screen ones that you can t cancel or get out of 
len ratingone Back to safari I guess 
len ratingfive It s so good it s so helpful everyone loves chrome I always Search in google maps earth chrome etc 
len ratingone  It crashes a lot 
len ratingone Totally useless on iPad

len ratingtwo Under normal circumstances I love chrome and most other google products 
len ratingtwo However bookmarking a link is cumbersome on iOS and every couple months the app crashes deleting EVERY tab I have and wiping the recently closed tabs page clean with no way to recover pages I ve had saved for a long time 
len ratingtwo The recover button they offer is easily misclicked and should be present for longer 
len ratingtwo Extremely frustrating 
len ratingfour Bad luck i love the best day ever on google
len ratingtwo  The food was good but the service was bad

len ratingone iPhone chrome open tabs are not syncing with other devices 
len ratingone  Hey there 
len ratingone Let s try the instructions in the Fix problems with sync section of this help center article 
len ratingone If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingone  Quality has only gone down over the years 
len ratingone There used to be no lag or crashes but now there are both getting more frequent with every update 
len ratingone Google Chrome constantly tries to get you to log in with your gmail email or google account which makes Google a pest 
len ratingone Then they send you advertisements EVERYWHERE 
len ratingone That makes them bothersome jerks 
len ratingone Then they will change your settings that you set to maximize your so called privacy and make it so that they can track location and junk 
len ratingone This makes them criminally immoral pissants 
len ratingone Don t use this crap browser 
len ratingone Firefox will protect location search history and accounts from Google even when you re using it 
len ratingone So go use Firefox which won t track you and stab you in the back 
len ratingone  One star due to no ad blocker being included with the app the fact that if you re in incognito mode it doesn t show you your favorites list of sites 
len ratingone Instead you have to click in multiple areas to get to them as bookmarks 
len ratingone Very inconvenient especially for someone like me who only uses private mode in browsers 
len ratingone Safari shows you your favorites at all times 
len ratingfour So awesome 
len ratingfour I can do whatever I want on this 
len ratingfive  Yes google and google chrome are both good to use 
len ratingfive Even the games they have 
len ratingfive But if you haven t heard that the small bug with the games is that there is no sound on them 
len ratingfive  Except pac man but I still love using this 
len ratingfive Like google dosent even make such secrets it s so cool 
len ratingfive And using elgoog website for the Zerg rush game because Zerg rush only available on pc 
len ratingfive But also keep up the great work 
len ratingone When typing in korean first letter of consonants and vowels are not connecting together and make the search results bad 
len ratingone It suppose to type instead 
len ratingone In additional google auto correction does not detect nor suggest the recommended search word 
len ratingthree Why this new UI 
len ratingthree Google chrome was perfect 
len ratingthree I use chrome on my iPhone because I DON T like the UI of Safari so why would you make it EXACTLY like Safari 
len ratingthree Im so angry at myself for updating the app 
len ratingthree Please go back to the toolbar at the top like in regular Chrome 
len ratingthree That was a stupid change 
len ratingone  What happen to my google internet this does not work right gave me google back
len ratingone Title says it all

len ratingthree So many years and yet still no reader mode 
len ratingthree Come on Google 
len ratingtwo  And it hardly works anymore because so many pages now crash the browser 
len ratingtwo Not just for your sanity but for your security consider using another browser 
len ratingtwo Google is unfortunately no longer a trustworthy or quality company 
len ratingfive Is was deed y eat lunch d add by email junk
len ratingfour It s so good because of indignities
len ratingthree I like Chrome a lot 
len ratingthree It s a great browser with a clean and easy to use interface 
len ratingthree I like it better that Safari but I can t make it my default browser 
len ratingthree The news feed in new tabs is a nice touch but can be annoying and I like that you can see history across your devices 
len ratingthree Too many times though I have opened the app to find that all of my tabs are gone 
len ratingthree The app had previously offered to recover the deleted tabs when this happened but now it doesn t seem to realize that anything has happened 
len ratingthree Chrome is a great app and I recommend it just be advised that it has some kinks 
len ratingthree After updating to ios most websites cannot blow up video players to fullscreen
len ratingtwo I request the easiest info such as what is America s current unemployment rate It gives me a bunch of nonsense about previous presidents ratings charts since how to figure farm and military employment but nothing current 
len ratingtwo It has become totally political 
len ratingtwo What a shame 
len ratingfour It works awesome but I just hate how you have to sign in 
len ratingone comeplete garbage get a laptop if you want the real google 
len ratingone Ive been using chrome for years

len ratingone Will be using one of chromes competitors from now on 
len ratingone Used to be fav app 
len ratingone Used to be best browser now BS ADS for you ve won a prize on Amazon or You re the millionth visitor with no way to escape or delete closing app and restarting only takes you back to bull crap ad leave it unusable 
len ratingone USER BEWARE
len ratingthree It s too laggy on my keyboard in the new version
len ratingtwo There should be a desktop chrome rather a phone chrome 
len ratingone I m the last few weeks this app has killed my battery 
len ratingone I was on it for minutes today and it dropped my battery 
len ratingthree Chrome may be secure but it definitely is not private 
len ratingthree Privacy is a right all human entitled to 
len ratingthree When using Google products you become a resource for their commercial exploitation 
len ratingthree Let s consider Safari then 
len ratingthree Apple seems to have abandoned development of their browser which make all the new Chrome features so enticing 
len ratingfive I love this app so much 
len ratingone For some odd reason I m Having major issues opening the app 
len ratingone Seems like it s frozen 
len ratingone Otherwise it s a great app way faster then safari

len ratingthree Something changed and my password manager can no longer can detect fields in order to populate them

len ratingfive If you could please fix this bug I would highly appreciate it 
len ratingfive Thank you very much 
len ratingone I m guilty of leaving up tabs open at all times it works for me 
len ratingone However about once a month I ll open the app and find all my tabs missing and irrecoverable 
len ratingone Today it happened after an update previous times who knows why 
len ratingone During these losses the history page doesn t even show them recoverable 
len ratingone Additionally why is the close all tabs button next to the new tab button 
len ratingone  Hey there 
len ratingone You can restore the last tabs you opened if you were signed in to your account in Chrome 
len ratingone On your iPhone or iPad open the Chrome app then go to three dots and tap History 
len ratingone Reopen any site you visited by just tapping at it 
len ratingone For more info chec
len ratingone It s a terrible step backwards for the web and should be disable able

len ratingfour Hi
len ratingthree I m not sure if it s just my phone but I ve been having to trouble with the app lately 
len ratingthree It really glitchy and the sound keeps cutting out whenever I try to watch a video 
len ratingthree I ve had to restart my phone and reinstall the app multiple times at once 
len ratingthree Through out the day it gives me this problem over and over again 
len ratingthree No only does the sound cut out but it s unbelievably slow and laggy 
len ratingthree I ve checked my WiFi connection but I still have the same problem but I do have to say when the app works fine it s a great web browser 
len ratingthree If I didn t have all these problems I would rate it a star app 
len ratingthree So google if you read this it might help that I m using this on IOS 
len ratingfive I love translation but the translation is very late despite the strong internet Please solve the problem thank you
len ratingtwo This used to be an amazing browser but recent updates have made it so slow that most normal websites are unusable now 
len ratingtwo It freezes and hangs for long periods of time 
len ratingtwo What happened 
len ratingfive Love using Chrome the only thing I would like to see in an update is to be able to save a website to my desktop as I am able to with Safari
len ratingfive I never rarely have to use any effort and in the cases I do I m on a weird site which i probably already don t like and overall I find google chrome to be a great browser and use it on all my devices and would make it the main browser on my device so ad block apps work but alas apple won t allow it as far as I can find anyways I saw this was a star so may as well write a star review to try to help this is my first review Overall great app
len ratingone Get off of Google products 
len ratingone Use the private Brave browser instead 
len ratingone It s exactly the same where it matters and way better everywhere else they don t steal your personal data 
len ratingone Google in general supports the oppression of the Chinese government against their own people 
len ratingone And there s strong evidence they plan on rigging future US elections using censorship and promotion of fake news 
len ratingone They are losers 
len ratingtwo I m signed into chrome on multiple accounts for very specific things 
len ratingtwo I used to switch the sync between these accounts but now that option is gone 
len ratingtwo I m stuck on my little sisters gmail account with her bookmarks saved passwords and search history being showed 
len ratingtwo The only way I can change it now is if I sign out of all of my gmail accounts and sign into the one I m trying to use 
len ratingtwo Stutters on loading amp discover hasn t been able to load for days now 
len ratingtwo Updates are current 
len ratingtwo  Hey there 
len ratingtwo You can learn how to speed up Chrome on your iPhone iPad by following the steps in this help center article

len ratingfour No question There isn t better than chrome it s my favourite browser I have been using it for a long time there is the reason that prevent me to reach stars well as you know there are more browsers I usually used mostly browsers the second one is uc browser it s something special when I download something using uc browser i saw the speed and I wonder so I decide that to use browsers when i want something to download my no choice is uc browser when i looking something that won t need to download I already use this one

len ratingone Until Chrome adds a bookmarks toolbar then still using Safari 
len ratingone  I have long been a user of Chrome 
len ratingone It was the best browser available 
len ratingone But on iOS it pales to Safari of all things 
len ratingone Safari being the worst browser in the iOS world 
len ratingone With each release of Chrome functionality becomes worse 
len ratingone Continuously crashing after actions or in use for more than minute 
len ratingone Don t even get me started on the awful design and functionality of the bookmarks tool 
len ratingone It could not have been designed poorly enough 
len ratingone Almost impossible to maintain 
len ratingone Very disappointing given the Chrome browser is the most popular browser 
len ratingone I guess the Google Chrome team could care less for their customers using the iOS platform 
len ratingone hehehehe

len ratingfive It s one of one on only one 
len ratingone Can t set up an Adblock for some reason I ll even take the full blame of not being able to figure it out 
len ratingone I imagine though when you bring in over billion dollars in Ad revenue in one year you don t want people to block ads 
len ratingone But privacy and antitrust concerns among other things are just the beginning of why I can no longer continue using google products 
len ratingfour You know what I have an idea y all should listen if u completely wanna replace safari add a download manager
len ratingthree Scrolling through pics from various sources Mobile FB and others they will NOT scroll 
len ratingthree It s like they frozen 
len ratingthree I have to use both hands to scroll so that I don t lose contact with the touch screen or else the photos scurry back up to the photo that I started from 
len ratingthree Effect happens EVERY time on FB 
len ratingthree Every 
len ratingthree Time 
len ratingthree On every photo stack 
len ratingthree I do not use the FB app and I never will 
len ratingthree Fix it or I ll find another browser that has or drop FB usage altogether 
len ratingthree No other options exist 
len ratingfive  everyone only uses it for porn let s be honest guys
len ratingone  Useless websearch engine 
len ratingone Doesn t have a previous page it alwYs gets stuckon page no return to previous site 
len ratingone Current version has a severe bug on typing Korean characters 
len ratingone Only on the first letter it doesn t composed into one character 
len ratingone It is separated into individual components of the character 
len ratingone In order to type a text one therefore should delete first letter

len ratingone Chrome on iOS is very unintuitive 
len ratingone I cannot easily change which account I sync data to which is a major disadvantage since I have three Google accounts 
len ratingone Also to close a tab you have to tap on the x instead of just sliding 
len ratingone These things really hinder the browsing experience 
len ratingfive Whenever I try to download google chrome it won t download and it takes a long time 
len ratingfour I use this to browse the internet and sell out my soul to the devil 
len ratingthree Recently recent tabs doesn t seem to sync between all my devices 
len ratingthree I use Chrome on my laptop iPhone and iPad so this is a must feature for me 
len ratingthree Sadly it has recently stopped working right 
len ratingthree My iPad can get recent tabs only from my laptop but not my iPhone for instance and the laptop can t get recent tabs from either my iPhone or my iPad 
len ratingthree I m going to update Chrome on my laptop to see if that will fix it but I don t think it wil

len ratingthree The interface is super clunky and way more annoying than the streamlined tab layout from before where there was a small unobtrusive button that opened the menu for the rest of the features like settings bookmarks history etc the fact that the bar is on the bottom of the screen now is just disorienting 
len ratingthree I initially chose chrome because I liked the simple streamlined layout and safari had the clunky ui but now chrome looks worse than safari aesthetically speaking 
len ratingthree Maybe give users the option to revert to the former 
len ratingthree I like chrome and don t want to stop using the app but this update is definitely not worth the hassle

len ratingthree  I love google chrome I m not sure what makes it make me use it over safari but I really like google chrome 
len ratingthree I use it on my phone so I love how you can just swipe up and reload delete or create a tab it makes it easier to do stuff 
len ratingthree The ONLY thing that is stopping me from giving this app a higher rating is the close all option 
len ratingthree I m not sure if I m the only one with this problem but I can t count the amount of times I ve accidentally delete all the tabs in chrome and couldn t get them back because I ve made a new tab since the create tab and close all options are so close together 
len ratingthree This is the only major feature that I hate about google chrome 
len ratingthree It can be fixed if you just put the close all option somewhere that is not in the open where users can accidentally press it and maybe even a warning or confirmation to delete all tabs if close all is pressed so it doesn t just delete everything instantly 
len ratingfive  I like it very very much 
len ratingone  Sheesse 
len ratingone Misleading information is a fraud sadly 
len ratingone Every time i swipe down the scroll of google webeste but it keeps comping up to top till i give up

len ratingone Haha

len ratingone Ever since the latest update Chrome is running super slow 
len ratingone Insanely slow 
len ratingone Mind blowingly cranky slow 
len ratingone It takes forever to load a link on a page sometimes it just says eh 
len ratingone F you and it crashes 
len ratingone Not cool 
len ratingone And even if it s not freezing up it s still crashing 
len ratingone November How is this issue not fixed 
len ratingone In fact it s worse 
len ratingone Chrome has started crashing on a daily basis the past several days 
len ratingone I can deal with that 
len ratingone What I can t deal with is reopening it and finding no open tabs and no option to restore my tabs 
len ratingone Add that to its privacy issues and that officially makes me looking for a better alternative

len ratingfive This engine is really great so far and I plan on using this engine from now on

len ratingfive I think It s better than safari excellent
len ratingtwo I stopped using Safari because they nixed the double tap to zoom function on the browser but chrome still had it 
len ratingtwo After the latest update Google removed that too 
len ratingtwo Pinching to zoom takes longer and for people like me with severe arthritis it s not conducive to how I wish to browse the internet 
len ratingone  The only way I could do it is because my parents were not going out of town and they had a job so they were not doing it so they had a Twitter right after they had to do a couple things they were not to go and I had a good day they had to go and I play it and I play a bunch and I eat
len ratingfive Best app ever so try the app so good
len ratingone I m so annoyed right now I actually decided to write a review something I never do PLEASE for the love of everything good in this world add a duplicate tab feature 
len ratingone I don t know anyone who has the time to copy a url open a new tab and paste said url 
len ratingone EVERY SINGLE TIME they want to duplicate a tab which can be useful for so many things 
len ratingone Shopping collaborating on documents research 
len ratingone While you re at it please add a open link in new tab feature or shortcut if you don t already have one 
len ratingone I know this is not the best you can do so I will revisit my review once you ve stepped up your game 
len ratingone Twice this has stung me the Close All button is awfully close to the new tab button and there is NO CONFIRMATION 
len ratingone Ludicrous 
len ratingone Google ADD A FREAKING CONFIRMATION after clicking the Close All button

len ratingone  Where are my video downloads 
len ratingone Big clunky and packed with unnecessary features 
len ratingone The update is messing up HTML on certain websites and making things not align correctly or load 
len ratingone This was not an issue last update and has been tested on multiple websites 
len ratingone  Hey there thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone Feel free to submit this feedback directly to our development team 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingthree  The interface is super clunky and way more annoying than the streamlined tab layout from before where there was a small unobtrusive button that opened the menu for the rest of the features like settings bookmarks history etc the fact that the bar is on the bottom of the screen now is just disorienting 
len ratingthree I initially chose chrome because I liked the simple streamlined layout and safari had the clunky ui but now chrome looks worse than safari aesthetically speaking 
len ratingthree Maybe give users the option to revert to the former 
len ratingthree I like chrome and don t want to stop using the app but this update is definitely not worth the hassle 
len ratingfive  got
len ratingfive Random but good
len ratingone This latest update absolutely destroyed open tabs sync for me 
len ratingone I can see all devices except for my iPhone and iPad all my devices include three PCs one for work home and laptop 
len ratingone This was the only thing I did in the last week that could have done this 
len ratingone My open tabs were working just a week ago and now this 
len ratingone I did every troubleshoot I could think of and find online but still no positive results 
len ratingone The tabs on my pc and MacBook still show up but no iPad or iPhone 
len ratingone  Chrome took a wrong turn this update 
len ratingone The stream lined menu that pops to the side of the screen and used screen real estate so efficiently is gone 
len ratingone Now when you open the book marks menu it half covers the screen instead of providing a nice long list of book marks to the side 
len ratingone Try and whip through the list and you risk the menu closing on you 
len ratingone Why Chrome

len ratingtwo When is dark mode coming in to chrome 
len ratingtwo  Hi 
len ratingtwo We wanted to follow up and confirm this feature has launched in the latest version of Chrome iOS running on iOS 
len ratingtwo Learn how to use Dark Mode here 
len ratingthree All it does is change the menu s and start page 
len ratingthree It doesn t even change Google s search results which is also part of their own company 
len ratingthree Dark mode should follow in the same vein as the dark mode plugins on Chrome and change the theme of websites to be dark unless they have a native dark mode 
len ratingthree I don t know why it took so long to come out after the update either since all they did was change their background to grey and nothing complicated was added
len ratingfive Thank you

len ratingfive Ok this web browser takes a modern design and gives it a google twist 
len ratingfive Not only is the security good it also has a voice thing 
len ratingfive BEAT THAT SAFARI 
len ratingfive This app beats safari because it takes everything Safari has and makes it better 
len ratingfive CONS 
len ratingfive There is a draw to type thing in here but it probroally has never even been updated 
len ratingfive It had the OLD google logo the text Is good old looking blue and it is rather slow 
len ratingfive If you re putting a modern design in put it in 
len ratingfive Oh well that little problem is nothing compared to how many pro s there are 
len ratingfive BYE

len ratingthree The most recent update seems to have caused all hyperlinks to have a much higher chance of being highlighted instead of opening up the open in menu 
len ratingthree If you re persistent you can eventually hit the sweet spot which seems to be almost completely off the hyperlink and get the open in menu open but it s not easy 
len ratingthree Prior to that I had no problems with Chrome 
len ratingthree I loved that even though both are on different OS I could sync Chrome between my PC and iPad iPhone 
len ratingone When Viacom sued Google I believe it happened in Google fought the court and Viacom to protect the personal data of users 
len ratingone Now Google uses Chrome and their other services to spy on users then sell your information to third party companies 
len ratingone Google controls the flow of information and subtlety manipulates you into finding only what they want you to see 
len ratingone They are a corrupt company and the only reason to use their services is because they have a monopoly 
len ratingone The competition is struggling because of Google s greed 
len ratingthree I often keep tabs open to refer back to them or save them for later but all my open tabs around were deleted in the last update 
len ratingthree There s no option to bring them back like when chrome crashes and then offers to restore your last session 
len ratingthree I had a lot of important websites and articles open but now I ve lost them all 
len ratingthree Other than this chrome is okay 
len ratingthree It s not spectacular but it s what I m used to so I ve used it for years 
len ratingthree  Hey there 
len ratingthree You can restore the last tabs you opened if you were signed in to your account in Chrome 
len ratingthree On your iPhone or iPad open the Chrome app then go to three dots and tap History 
len ratingthree Reopen any site you visited by just tapping at it 
len ratingthree For more info chec
len ratingtwo Chrome asks for your location on every single page you open 
len ratingtwo Not once but every page every time you use it 
len ratingtwo Almost impossible to search google because the pop up keeps coming up and never goes away 
len ratingone Update Awesome 
len ratingone A new update from Chrome 
len ratingone What do we get with this new update 
len ratingone NOTHING 
len ratingone No full version of Chrome like there is for Safari No Web Midi No browser access to full version of Google Docs No browser access to full version of Google Sheets No browser access to full version of Google Drive No browser access to full version of Gmail This is not an update it s pandering 
len ratingone  Google products never fail to disappoint 
len ratingone I needed to access a web midi page for a new midi controller I got 
len ratingone I thought since it is google chrome that has web midi surely this is on all chrome browsers right 
len ratingone Wrong 
len ratingone Again Google why is it such a challenge for you all to make your apps EXACTLY the same as the desktop 
len ratingone Why is this so difficult 
len ratingone Your browser even 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone Y all know that thanks to the new update on iOS full version of Safari can run on an iPad 
len ratingone Where s your iOS full version of Chrome 
len ratingfive Crime is A 
len ratingfive Oh my god it s so good I never had problems
len ratingtwo New dark mode is gray not black looks very bad vs other apps with true dark mode

len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive Me ayuda a ver nopor
len ratingone  You need to fix your app 
len ratingfour There is a bug in the image search 
len ratingfour When you press on the picture to search chrome highlights it as if you want to copy the image 
len ratingfour This started with the latest update 
len ratingone The app hogs more storage in cache than the size of the app itself and clearing it or trying to does nothing Hey there thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone Feel free to submit this feedback directly to our development team 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive I love Chrome but this version is held back by Apple s unfair and anticompetitive rules 
len ratingfive I really hope that Apple adopt ethical app store guidelines that ensures a level playing field for all who enter 
len ratingfive This browser can t be as good as the built in Safari browser because Apple forces rd party browsers to use the mobile Safari engine 
len ratingfive In the meantime Safari on iPad gets to use a full big boy desktop engine 
len ratingfive On the bright side it is nice to have my Chrome bookmarks and passwords sync over 
len ratingfive Too bad Apple won t allow Google to also implement Chrome extensions 
len ratingfive If that were something Google could control I d remove a star 
len ratingfive  Epiccccccc 
len ratingfive Useful
len ratingtwo  Pages will scroll when they feel like it that is assuming they don t just crash altogether
len ratingthree I don t like how it continually auto refreshes when I go between tabs 
len ratingthree I wish there was a way to turn it off 
len ratingfive Join beta 
len ratingfive Need an invitation code 
len ratingone idk if it s the recent update or something but now i can t open the app on my phone at all 
len ratingone when i try to i just stare at the logo like when the app first opens forever till i exit out of the app 
len ratingone sometimes it gives me a black screen and force closes itself 
len ratingone Apple is better than google
len ratingthree I have the ad blocker on but it s not working the ads are still popping up fix it
len ratingfour I know there s tracking that goes on with the internet and linking your phone in to that consents to that but my chrome is crashing every seconds since this new update 
len ratingfour What gives 
len ratingone Upon installing the latest version here all my open tabs were lost and seem to be unrecoverable 
len ratingone I generally haven t had problems with previous updates but this is a terrible issue to encounter considering how poor the options for saving exporting open tabs are on iOS version of Chrome 
len ratingthree Sooo going to fix the consistent crashing when background or screen locked 
len ratingthree I mean its been going on since iOS beta 
len ratingthree Rather annoying to lose all your tabs just because you walk away and the screen locks
len ratingfour I enjoy the app a lot and I love I can search anything but when I want to go back it doesn t work all the time and it s really annoying but that s the only problem I have with this app
len ratingone I want separate chrome browsers for each of my emails like I have on my laptop 
len ratingone I do not want the info from each browser email combined in ANY way 
len ratingone I have both the Chrome and the Google app and could not figure out how to access the passwords on one of my browser emails using either app 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingone All three emails were signed in yet there is no clear way to make ONE of the emails the dominate one 
len ratingone THEN for some crazy reason my Youtube changed to the other account 
len ratingone To further frustration even Safari has all three of my emails signed in to SAFARI which each new page leaching my date per email 
len ratingone One page is hooked to one email then the other to my other email 
len ratingone Why my Apple browser is canabalizing my google email I will never know 
len ratingone I ve had to uninstall this twice this week because it keeps crashing and closing all my tabs Hi Thanks for reaching out 
len ratingone Try the steps to solve crashes issues in this Help Center article 
len ratingone If you re still having trouble the experts in our community may be able to help 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfour Yes
len ratingfive  Excellent
len ratingfive Chicken fingers
len ratingfour I love this app for so many reasons 
len ratingfour You can easily surf the web less ads and setting up more customization more thingies to do 
len ratingfour But it is annoying that it will send me to get other google apps such as news drive and playgames but is easy 
len ratingfour Old annoyances have been fixed such as the too convenient close all tabs button 
len ratingfour I also recommend google docs slides and YouTube sub to me Silver Spitfire Search For Silver Spitfire Clash Royale crying king pic and I may change channel name to Maygk or Maygkcal Gaming 
len ratingfour Also though to devs pls update chrome os on chromebook to work with clash royale and clash of clans 
len ratingfour  Note both are games great games I would highly recommend 
len ratingfour  Another note Join GG Goblin Gang in clash of clans 
len ratingtwo When looking up a direction to a certain place and google and click directions pops up Google Maps 
len ratingtwo Why cant Google Map take that info from the original inquiries 
len ratingtwo It makes you AGAIN enter where you want to go and unless you put exactly what city you want to go to 
len ratingtwo Was this like that before 
len ratingtwo I don t believe so 
len ratingtwo It s frustrating 
len ratingtwo Go back to an easier application 
len ratingthree Dear Google please bring forced dark mode flag like you did on desktop Google Chrome to iOS and this browser will be perfect 
len ratingthree I am tired of using smart invert with Safari to read news and surfing in the night on the bed 
len ratingtwo I was extremely excited to see Dark Mode in the release notes 
len ratingtwo Then I saw it in action 
len ratingtwo Blacks are not actually black so my OLED screen gets no real benefit in terms of battery life 
len ratingtwo Then although menus and headers are dark sites like GMail are still blindingly white 
len ratingtwo For iPhone users this is not a great replacement for the smart invert colors function 
len ratingtwo Hoping some improvements can be made though I m not holding my breath since Google seems to consider iOS mostly unimportant 
len ratingfive You guys ourover
len ratingone Chrome used to crash once every couple of months

len ratingthree VPN not included 
len ratingthree Search results needs improvement 
len ratingthree Fast browsing and results 
len ratingthree Analysis good but ads not
len ratingtwo Has anyone experiences a black screen 
len ratingone The most frustrating part of this update is that when I click on the url to try to copy it I cannot have the entire url highlighted 
len ratingone I have to do it manually 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingfive So I have an iPhone s I think it s getting out dated from other iPhone Since the original apps for the iPhone not working had to get this internet 
len ratingfive Years ago they did this to my s I was forced to upgrade so thanks for now and remember keep having your app compatible with older phones thanks 
len ratingfive I can t give them feedback so here to you stars 
len ratingone Recently noticed after the loading the page completely in few movements we are worked with oh snap probably something that Needs attention
len ratingone I had over tabs opened and recently updated the app and opened it today and nothing of the tabs I had are there 
len ratingone Really bs 
len ratingthree  I navigate FB via web browser bc I will NOT have the app for several years 
len ratingthree It s had its issues at times but nothing like this 
len ratingthree If there is a series of photos to scroll through scrolling will hang and just bounce like a soft lock on one photo 
len ratingthree It has no pattern 
len ratingthree It s not always the st photo 
len ratingthree It s not always the middle photo 
len ratingthree It will lock wherever it pleases 
len ratingthree Sometimes it releases 
len ratingthree Sometimes I have to close the app and start over 
len ratingthree That is the part that is annoying as crap 
len ratingtwo  This looks the same on as it did at disgusting 
len ratingtwo After OnePlus mess I ll stay in the crappy garden as long as it keeps working 
len ratingtwo Siri is dumbsmart and Gasst is smart jerk dumb 
len ratingtwo To each their own 
len ratingthree I really wish there was a select all when deleting spam or trash emails 
len ratingthree Also as of lately when I view my emails it s not showing any of the pictures in the email 
len ratingone The one thing I hate about this app is that I always lose all my tabs 
len ratingone And so what I do is go to restore tabs and their are none I had over tabs 
len ratingone Please fix this problem 
len ratingone Unfortunately I need google chrome for my college work 
len ratingone I tried to download it but when I open it it says there s no connection 
len ratingone I deleted the app and reinstalled it but got the same thing so it s useless to me 
len ratingone Very disappointed
len ratingfive Perfect app thx Before last update there was an issue that every time i close the app next time i open it all opened pages were gone with an option to restore last page only 
len ratingfive After update the issue still happened Please fix it Thx again
len ratingtwo This software doesn t fit into the flow of iOS 
len ratingtwo The swipes feel different and it doesn t really feel like a good fit for the the modern Apple workflow 
len ratingtwo This is coming from a former android user and a chrome user on ever other platform 
len ratingtwo Please give me a reason to not use safari anymore 
len ratingfour I love chrome and used it all the time but when I got my new phone I tried to download it but it won t work 
len ratingfour Chrome has always been super reliable for me and I definitely prefer it over safari so I hope they get this problem fixed soon 
len ratingfive Excelente y veraz medio de informaci n veredica dentro de los par metros de la verdad

len ratingthree I need to find the original program icon to open chrome again 
len ratingfour Finally dark mode has arrived in this update 
len ratingfour Unfortunately most webpages have a White backgrounds and dark mode didn t fix this

len ratingone Chrome needs a lot of work before I use it again 
len ratingone Dark mode is supposed to be better for two things eyes and saving battery

len ratingfour Learn how to use Dark Mode here 
len ratingone Chrome for IPad is getting dull and boring it always crashes when I m reading something on the net like for a particular game for ps or something about the news anything And no matter how many times I report it because no one really reads those things 
len ratingone they never fix it patch it update it 
len ratingone I mean it s sad how long has it been since we got an update 
len ratingone It seems the developers and or whatever don t really care about chrome or anything else 
len ratingone Why on earth would you waste your precious storage space on your Apple device for a replacement Safari 
len ratingone Safari can do everything Chrome can do and then some 
len ratingone Plus having to retype in all of your passwords is redundant 
len ratingone Waste of space and time 
len ratingfive  add dark mode for chrome ios
len ratingone You people should make this a app for people with about the age of and up not

len ratingthree Lot of non google apps support chromecast

len ratingfour The bar is grey 
len ratingfour No matter what I do it just won t work 
len ratingfour For this reason I ll give this app stars 
len ratingfour I know this app is good but with its inability to download at least from my experience although it s compatible stars are the best I can give 
len ratingfour I WILL change my rating once I find the problem and get this fixed

len ratingone I needed to access a web midi page for a new midi controller I got 
len ratingone I thought since it is google chrome that has web midi surely this is on all chrome browsers right 
len ratingone Wrong 
len ratingone Again Google why is it such a challenge for you all to make your apps EXACTLY the same as the desktop 
len ratingone Why is this so difficult 
len ratingone Your browser even 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone Y all know that thanks to the new update on iOS full version of Safari can run on an iPad 
len ratingone Where s your iOS full version of Chrome 
len ratingone  I have now shunned all of the Google apps because they are extremely slow at rolling out dark mode where smaller developers have been quick to support it 
len ratingone This developer is extremely slow at keeping up with updated OS and trends 
len ratingone As a large company I expect better 
len ratingone Even Microsoft has already embraced this trend and added dark mode to its wildly popular suite including Outlook 
len ratingone Just this we it started where I am unable to switch between accounts which IMHO makes the account virtually useless since I use different accounts for different functions ie google drive YouTube etc 
len ratingone That s it 
len ratingone That s the review 
len ratingthree  Where is it 
len ratingthree Love almost everything else 
len ratingtwo  For some odd reason even though my phone is compatible and the version of my IOS is also compatible it refuses to download

len ratingone I see there s a new update did you guys fix the part where google is a biased search engine that sways millions of votes by simply having people read specific article titles yet 
len ratingthree This is the most annoying issue for me 
len ratingtwo Updated my iPhone to and updated Chrome as well 
len ratingtwo Chrome keeps crashes all the time now 
len ratingtwo It ll load a page and poof crashes 
len ratingtwo Midway streaming something 
len ratingtwo Crashed be refreshed and crash again 
len ratingtwo Did not have this problem before the iOS update and app update 
len ratingfour I think Chrome is a great app and I have been using it for a few years 
len ratingfour I didn t think that you had to update it so I missed it for a whole year 
len ratingfour When I decided to update it I first looked at the reviews 
len ratingfour People had been saying that it had been jumbled up but I didn t see that 
len ratingfour Another person said that it was harder to delete a tab although it wasn t so I tried deleting a tab 
len ratingfour Usually it took away the tab slowly if it was my only one and it would make me tap a plus sign to get another one 
len ratingfour This time It took it away very fast and it hurt my eyes 
len ratingfour Once it was there and then you press an x and it was gone 
len ratingfour IT REALLY HURTS MY EYES 
len ratingfour I wish I hadn t even updated it 
len ratingfour It may not seem serious but it is to me 
len ratingone  I wish chrome would act like safaris new iOS how things for example YouTube and other pages work exactly like a desktop site but made for iPad 
len ratingone Compare both chrome and safari the new safari is better at desktop versions but I want chrome I use everything google and want chrome to be like this
len ratingone  Thanks for not allowing a comment section to trash this unqualified piece of crap we call the president of the unified states 
len ratingone We ve been overrun by Iran in our government 
len ratingone Money buys power and they have all that oil money 
len ratingone Give as much money to a spy as he needs to get a seat on the house of rep then bring in more of your spies and then start changing the constitution that are fathers built 
len ratingone F America today 
len ratingone I m coming fro you Iran and Russian you dirty pigs 
len ratingone America 
len ratingtwo  It was good but times where it randomly crashes is the worst especially when there were important tabs for work or school or maps 
len ratingtwo Closes all tabs upon crash therefore I stuck with Safari 
len ratingfive Google chrome is a great app 
len ratingfive Seriously it s the only internet browser I use on both my phone and my laptop 
len ratingfive But you know what would make it even better 
len ratingfive Adding a dark mode setting

len ratingfive Microsoft edge is just a rebranded Internet Explorer chrome is the overlord of search Engines if you give it one star than you are just a edge fanboy
len ratingone Oh my what a wicked app this is Ads here there in your hair and underwear 
len ratingone Sad and sorry it is

len ratingfour Google is one of the last apps including Facebook that won t update their apps to support dark mode 
len ratingfour We need these updates ASAP Hi 
len ratingfour We wanted to follow up and confirm this feature has launched in the latest version of Chrome iOS on iOS 
len ratingfour Learn how to use Dark Mode here 
len ratingone Faster and cleaner 
len ratingone Downside is fewer extensions that I have used for years and years and years 
len ratingone Maybe they will get it fixed but it has been several months and still the white screen off death 
len ratingone Before that it was so S L O W that I would make and down a couple of cocktails waiting for it kiddingbof course 
len ratingone Keeps crashing and losing any open tabs 
len ratingone  The close all button is so supremely stupid I think it s time to see if Firefox has everything I need yet
len ratingone Typing can be delayed 
len ratingone Pasting into url bar is inconsistent as well 
len ratingone The app is generally buggy and seems to be unpolished on the new iOS 
len ratingfive This used to work great but now it freezes up my phone and I have to force kill it 
len ratingfive This is difficult because of how sluggish the phone is while chrome is running and can take a minute or so to actually close 
len ratingfive Another unpleasant side effect is that it drains my battery even if I m not using it 
len ratingfive I have not tabs running just the home screen and this still happens 
len ratingfive It all started when I saw A We Bare Bears clip when Panda gets a free Gorb from a Imitation version of you called Googs When Panda turned on the Gorb the Googs mascot Smorby the Worm came out of the Gorb

len ratingone Doesn t allow me select DuckDuckGo as a search engine

len ratingone Google is the monopoly 
len ratingone I don t want to use Bing Yandex or Google 
len ratingone Let me use the search engine I want in url field 
len ratingthree Unlike desktop chrome or android this version cannot cast to google chrome cast

len ratingone Google home is no better on iPad and iPhone 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingfour When are you bringing it 
len ratingone App is constantly crashing with Aw snap errors appearing repeatedly 
len ratingone Clearing cache does nothing 
len ratingone Closing and reopening Chrome does nothing 
len ratingone Error occurs even with only one tab open 
len ratingtwo iPadOS is suppose to offer desktop browser capabilities this function does not yet seem to be addressed in this apps updates 
len ratingtwo Please consider 
len ratingtwo I used to use chrome to listen to TWR as it was more stable than safari or brave with maintaining a continuous connection over several hours without crashing and resetting the browser and thus disconnecting me from my tunes 
len ratingtwo Now it plays for less than a minute in the background and just cuts off the audio but when you open chrome nothing seems amiss but the audio has stopped 
len ratingtwo Please release a fix that works with the new WebKit implementation 
len ratingone If you want the almighty Google to have even more reign over your personal data this app is for you 
len ratingone I have personally had enough of Don t Be Evil being evil 
len ratingone Want to keep your info to yourself 
len ratingone Stick with Safari 
len ratingone Switch to duck Duck go for your search engine 
len ratingone Delete your Google and Gmail accounts but first make sure to expunge all of your collected data from your account settings 
len ratingone Then enjoy the peace of mind knowing the most evil company to ever exist is not making Butt loads of money from your private and personably identifiable data 
len ratingone Be happy to say auf wiedersehen noch Google 
len ratingone Ja das ist richtig und ein gut Idee

len ratingone But cant use safari cause i cant stand it 
len ratingfive Marty was great to work with and great follow up after the sale Thank you Marty for all your help
len ratingtwo  Please fix the crashing 
len ratingtwo I lost many tabs due to crashing 
len ratingone Used to be able to load my gmail on a tab and now no images show up in my emails 
len ratingone Not sure why but ever since I got the new update this happened 
len ratingtwo There are two reasons I use Chrome on my laptop web development and the ability to have and quickly switch between multiple users with separate sets of prefs extensions bookmarks and history 
len ratingtwo That way I don t have to constantly sign in and out 
len ratingtwo Now I have other ways of doing web dev on my phone but I still wanted to be able to access all my various user profiles 
len ratingtwo It s the number one reason I downloaded it to my phone 
len ratingtwo However you apparently can t do that on iOS Chrome 
len ratingtwo You can switch users on all OTHER Google iOS apps but not Chrome 
len ratingtwo Which completely defeats the purpose of it for me 
len ratingone Use to a great app but now they block everything so it is useless now I will delete it
len ratingone iOS released dark mode and more apps are adding their own dark mode setting in applications 
len ratingone Chrome needs this option for iOS as it s already available for Android and desktop users 
len ratingone Until then star

len ratingone I did not understand a charge to my card obviously I m upset the girl on the phone immediately started challenging the way I think 
len ratingone This was my first time ever staying at an extended stay or getting a hotel on my own with my own card and ID 
len ratingone It was a confusing and mentally taxing experience 
len ratingone I will never stay at one of these again and I will urge anyone who is not experienced in renting hotels to not stay here 
len ratingone I download the app and it doesn t even let me open it 
len ratingone I m trying to get stuff done and I m being told to download google chrome which I thought I already did well apparently not and it won t let me open the app now 
len ratingone No wonder iPhones use different web browsers now 
len ratingfive Google chrome is ok
len ratingfour Its very annoying to close windows

len ratingfive  Use it for everything
len ratingone I have been more comfortable using chrome over safari for a long long time much to the sha grin of all of my friends who are loyal to apple but I have to tell you they are now correct 
len ratingone You guys have destroyed it 
len ratingone I can t even swipe pictures anymore all it does is freezes among many other issues

len ratingone Chrome is literally the worst thing to happen to the internet 
len ratingone It tracks you and allows Google to have a bigger monopoly 
len ratingone Switch to Firefox 
len ratingfour This is a fallback browser for me but it works fine 
len ratingfour Bookmark syncing is seamless 
len ratingfour Same rendering engine as Safari iOS so no major advantages here either 
len ratingfive Rely on it for iOS 
len ratingfive  Chrome was the reason human beings evolved
len ratingone Few minutes on chrome eats of my battery 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome but that close all button needs to get moved 
len ratingone I lost almost all of the webpages I had open and when I started to open them through the recently closed as I opened some others that I hadn t clicked on disappeared 
len ratingone I had pages open that had been there for a while and I m not likely to find them again 
len ratingone You need to move that button or make it so I can search through history by device 
len ratingfive  Hey I love this phone it cute and good fast service 
len ratingfive Chrome is the best
len ratingfive Google is just better than Apple in the software department all their stuff works better
len ratingthree I ve been using Chrome for years now on all of my devices it s my favorite browser 
len ratingthree However a recent iPhone update had made using Chrome on my phone more of a chore 
len ratingthree The most glaring change is that settings and tabs are now shown at the bottom of the screen rather than the top similar to how Safari looks 
len ratingthree But that s exactly the issue this layout is one of the main reasons I chose Crome over Safari on my phone but now they both have this issue 
len ratingthree It s a small problem but it s one that has changed the way I few this app 
len ratingthree I wish I had a way to change it back 
len ratingfive Why is the limit and plus 
len ratingfive I have seen kindergartens use it at my school and everyone in every grade it is way to high in the age limit 
len ratingfive It should be at and plus maybe like it is basically google but with chrome and I could get safari and there age limit isn t high I want to use it and I can t please lower it 
len ratingfive I want to be able to open the app but it is that s ridiculous especially when safari is like

len ratingfive it s way more annoying
len ratingfour Every time I go to the google chrome app theres a pop up listing all the accounts I have signed up with and even though I press ok it ll continue to pop up EVERY time 
len ratingfour Love chrome as my default browser but I had to delete this and download the google app because it just got too annoying having a constant impediment 
len ratingfour Chrome has been a good mobile browser for a while now but the iPad version could really get some changes to match iPad OS 
len ratingfour The MAIN THING is please make the iPad version a desktop browser automatically and so you don t have to go and choose to make a page desktop 
len ratingfour The second improvement would be to add the ability to have tabs in different windows like many apps are doing now that it is available 
len ratingtwo I stopped using chrome a while ago because for some reason CHROMECAST isn t available 
len ratingtwo The app they have for it is terrible 
len ratingtwo Why do we need to download and possibly pay for a service that works well 
len ratingtwo It is one of the perks of having a chromecast and I can t even do it through the CHROME browser

len ratingthree I was bored on my IPad and so I went to google chrome and decided to hit the button until I had tabs 
len ratingthree Once I finally gat to a smiley face appeared where the number was supposed to be 
len ratingthree Honestly it REALLY freaked me out 
len ratingthree The creepy thing was that it kept creating new tabs and I couldn t delete them anymore 
len ratingthree I had to delete the app and reinstall it to fix it 
len ratingone EVERYTIME I open the app it tells me im logged in 
len ratingone Ive updated the app and it CONTINUES to pop up whenever I go into the app 
len ratingone Annoying 
len ratingtwo OK I got it OK I got it OK I got it OK I got it OK I got it OK I got it OK I got it OK I got it
len ratingone  For the same website on same device Chrome crashed so much more often than Apple s web browser 
len ratingone I am so disappointed that Google can not fix this problem 
len ratingthree  They are studying what you research and taking photos of you 
len ratingone This is the second time I had to uninstall chrome 
len ratingone I used to love it since I m synced all my devices 
len ratingone I just tried to get to a website through my email and it took me to where you close tabs and would not let me open the tab 
len ratingone I tried just going through chrome app and same thing 
len ratingone It also kept popping up the your signed in notification every time I got on to chrome 
len ratingone What ever you guys did when you updated it screwed the system up 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone I might just go back to Firefox
len ratingthree I use chrome on both my iPad and iPhone and I have pretty bad eyesight 
len ratingthree There is no way for me to change the text size to be larger on chrome not even by changing system settings 
len ratingthree This needs to change because of this there are a limited range of people that can use chrome 
len ratingthree Yes you can change the text size in the tabs and settings through system settings but what help does that give someone who can t read the text of the website itself 
len ratingthree Yes I know the text is decided by whoever creates the website but there still needs to be a way to be able to make the text larger 
len ratingthree Application no update please see
len ratingone Would like option to make website show desktop webpage on iPad 
len ratingone At the moment there is an option to request desktop webpage but it has to be done everytime 
len ratingone Ipad screen is large so regular desktop page is fine 
len ratingfour  Since updating to iOS Chrome keeps changing my keyboard back to the default apple crap every time the screen turns off on my iPhone 
len ratingfour I use swiftkey because I require a number row at the top of my keyboard 
len ratingfour This is very annoying
len ratingone I have come to really dislike Chrome and its Google s fault 
len ratingone The UI feels slow thanks to their emphasis on bringing their Material design along ignoring platform specific design guidelines 
len ratingone This makes for an app that feels out of place but also feels slower than native apps 
len ratingone While this is annoying the truly unforgivable is video autoplay 
len ratingone This is true regardless of platform and demonstrates they care more about advertising than providing consumer with the choice to control how to browse the web 
len ratingtwo Repeated sign in dialog is still present

len ratingone Learn how to use Dark Mode here 
len ratingone I don t really remember why I stopped using it 
len ratingone But I did 
len ratingone Maybe something about how you can t use Chrome everywhere in iOS so most of the time you end up using Safari 
len ratingone Hardly Google s fault 
len ratingone Whatever the reason I stopped using it 
len ratingone The star is for all the other Google apps that keep endlessly prompting you to install Chrome 
len ratingone Sometimes there s a switch to not ask again 
len ratingone Usually it does absolutely nothing 
len ratingone When it does work it only remembers your preference for a few days 
len ratingone I m looking at you GMail 
len ratingone Now I never want it 
len ratingone I ve started uninstalling other Google apps that insist on bugging me about it 
len ratingone Go away Chrome 
len ratingone It stinks 
len ratingthree Used to be great for both desktop and mobile simpler than Safari and less glitchy than Firefox 
len ratingthree But recently it s been automatically hitting the back button on its own at random sometimes forgetting where back was and frequently crashing while watching videos 
len ratingthree Please fix this or I may have to switch back to Firefox regretfully 
len ratingfive  Thanks for the update 
len ratingone For the past two weeks I haven t been able to get videos full screen on websites 
len ratingone YouTube Facebook nothing 
len ratingthree Why don t you have download manager same as safari 
len ratingthree This update causes the sound to go off when the app is not visible on the screen or when the iPad or iPhone locks 
len ratingthree Please fix this as I like to listen to this app in the background 
len ratingthree This happens every time there is a software update

len ratingthree  And also fix you re signed in pop up 
len ratingtwo So I have regular google accounts that I use and with the majority of other Google apps I can simply swap between the accounts 
len ratingtwo I know you are asking why would I have multiple accounts 
len ratingtwo One is my personal one for school professional and the last is specific to work 
len ratingtwo On both my android phone and iPad I have been able to swap between accounts for purposes of bookmarks and login credentials 
len ratingtwo Now in the last month or so with a recent update I can no longer swap accounts and only have access to the login credentials and bookmarks of my main account and can t access these from my other accounts along with browser history tabs from other devices 
len ratingtwo I really hope that Google either brings this feature back or provides the means to swap like I can with other apps such as GMail Drive etc that allow the simple swipe on the account image or even Keep where you have to tap and then select 
len ratingtwo If this feature can be fixed I would be more likely to change my rating back up to stars 
len ratingone Can t Cast with mobile browser or install extensions

len ratingtwo Since updating to iOS I can no longer even do simple things like open the in app settings 
len ratingtwo Aside from that that app is usually 
len ratingfour It s time for dark mode to come to Google Chrome hopefully soon or I ll move back to Safari 
len ratingone  I sort of expected this since Google puts priority to Android 
len ratingone But no dark mode makes this app look dumb 
len ratingone Ok first of all ITS SO SLOW I MIGHT ASWELL GO SWIM IN THE POOL AS IT LOADS 
len ratingone Second of all it always kicks me out doesn t work and tries to give me scams inappropriate ads come on pop ups come up when I block them and when I block them it tries to scam to get em to put them back on LIKE WHAT KIND OF SEARCH ENGINE IS THIS ITS A PIECE OF CRAP DONT GET GOOGLE CHROME ITS SO ANNOYING 
len ratingone  This is why I hate chrome because this thing keeps popping up and it says put in you re Apple ID password and like dummy me I don t know my password to my Apple ID so that s why and also the new update is exactly like safari so that s two reasons to hate chrome you lovers of chrome
len ratingfour The only way this browser can get any better is to start doing the forced desktop mode like safari is doing on iPadOS 
len ratingfour Come on devs 
len ratingone  This browser has become a data vacuum cleaner as Google clutches to anyway to track you

len ratingone I was drawing then got an error
len ratingone Every time I open chrome it keeps notifying me my data is synced 
len ratingone This is so annoying
len ratingthree I ve used chrome practically since launch on computer and phone 
len ratingthree I don t know if it s an issue with apple or google but it bothers me that you cannot activate a pop up blocker in mobile chrome 
len ratingthree Even some external services like Malwarebytes can t connect with mobile chrome meaning you re not totally safe 
len ratingthree I use a VPN on my phone ans I trust Google s security otherwise but accidentally clicking an advertisement on your iPhone has potentially drastic consequences 
len ratingthree Find a way to optimise the technology your competitors clearly already have and use 
len ratingone Rat 
len ratingone Since updating to iOS I am no longer able to keep audio going if app closes or if phone locks 
len ratingone Please fix

len ratingone I usually like chrome but I have to say there cast technology is the most confusing backward brain vexer 
len ratingone I m in complete shock how tedious it is to figure out but even more annoying is that it s strange puzzle of a path to get it to work changes so when you go to watch again the next day it s a completely different path I wonder why u can t just plug it in maybe sign in and it s good to go

len ratingthree I blows my mind that we re in and the google devs still haven t implemented a feature that allows you to add your own custom links to websites on a new tab page 
len ratingthree Google chrome randomly deletes and adds whatever it wants whenever it wants 
len ratingthree I used to have the google website link on there but suddenly it disappeared even though it s my most visited website 
len ratingthree It just does not make any sense what downside there will be in having custom links on a new tab page 
len ratingthree Also I was once forced to uninstall the app because there is no other way to close any tabs other than clicking on the tab number icon and if there is an intrusive popup on screen good luck closing out of it 
len ratingthree Another feature that s missing 
len ratingfive  Looking for Robert Craven
len ratingone Every time I log on it says you re signed in and I have to click out of it

len ratingtwo My boyfriend has erased all my phone apps information and I m trying to find each one but having no access to chrome has limited my phone usage to review updating information on my mobile apps 
len ratingone  I am aware that I am signed in to Chrome under multiple accounts so I don t need your idiotic pop up informing me of this fact EVERY TIME I SWITCH TO CHROME 
len ratingone I REALLY don t want to start using Firefox or Safari on my iPhone but I will if this BS continues 
len ratingone  Please have the pop up blocker work I get constant ads and it s quite annoying also chrome now all drains of my battery and that s not good at all please improve and add the ability for extensions And I can pop up ads that I cannot close out of so I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it in order for the pop up to go away so please please fix this

len ratingfive Good quality
len ratingtwo I love google chrome and have been using it for a while however I don t love a side effect of the recent update 
len ratingtwo I have a bookmarks folder that I typically access and organize on my phone and ever since I updated the app the scrolling in the bookmarks folder to move bookmarks around has been abysmally slow particularly when dragging items at the bottom to the top 
len ratingtwo It takes FOREVER and seeing as my bookmark folder is quite large this is a huge inconvenience for me 
len ratingtwo Prior to this update everything was fine so I don t know what happened 
len ratingtwo Hoping this gets fixed soon 
len ratingtwo  Identity thief of my accounts and my business

len ratingone  Good app unfortunately google wants to save all your info and save passwords 
len ratingone Do not use this app if you use Android devices it is very unsafe google s security is very weak and they are more interested is selling your info than keeping you secured 
len ratingone Scam unsafe 
len ratingone If you login to any google platform app or parent company such as you tube You will be login all the time 
len ratingone This is very unsafe and your info is open to virus and other scamers such as google 
len ratingone Try it If you are signed in in you tube 
len ratingone Go to google g mail and is going to be already open and the worst thing is that they track every movement in your phone not browser 
len ratingone SCAM safety is not their number one priority 
len ratingone SCAM 
len ratingtwo Will note allow saving documents to iCloud or Power Point 
len ratingone  Stop using google as a search engine and google chrome unless you want all of your searches to be filtered through what google wants you to know 
len ratingone Use DuckDuckGo and firefox 
len ratingone Down with google
len ratingone Voy a dejar 
len ratingone De usar esa basura de navegador por qu no borra los datos de navegaci n 
len ratingone Le das a borrar y se quedan igualitos

len ratingthree  Chrome NEEDS a dark mode then I d give it stars
len ratingthree The latest update seems to randomly require me to restart my entire phone to get Chrome to actually work 
len ratingthree Restarting the app does nothing 
len ratingthree It simply shows the Chrome logo for about secs before closing the app 
len ratingfive It s so good 
len ratingfive I LOVE GOOGLE I hate it Jk
len ratingone Google has been skewing search results based on their political bias 
len ratingone I m done google 
len ratingone I m moving everything off your platform I ve sold my stock in alphabet and used the money to buy Microsoft 
len ratingone I now use bing for all my searches since they are not politically motivated
len ratingone what s going on 
len ratingone downloaded all Google products on app tried to chromecast from the phone and the cast icon is no where to be found 
len ratingone the Google home app showed connection availability and in the actual website can t cast 
len ratingone the setting option is very limited 
len ratingthree It starts by using minimal storage but the more you use it the more it takes up 
len ratingthree It s ridiculous it s using almost an entire gig now

len ratingthree Right when I press search it will hang there for seconds 
len ratingthree I have an iPhone X 
len ratingthree My buddy has an Android and the same is happening with his as well 
len ratingfour  Finally got a good nonmmmm
len ratingone  as of this morning you could still switch which of your google accounts you were signed into on mobile very very easily under Settings yet somehow throughout the day w o any update from the App Store this all changed 
len ratingone You now only have the option of signing out completely and no longer syncing any data vs just simply switching between accounts 
len ratingone Please bring back the previous option as I do not see any benefit to the new current one 
len ratingone I want to be able to switch between accounts as we always were able to 
len ratingone Instead there are now identical screens saying you re signed in as yet no option to ACTUALLY choose which account you re signed in as 
len ratingone This is really quite annoying 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive  Yeah just that
len ratingone In a word Useless 
len ratingone Puts phone in a download loop and does nothing 
len ratingone So downloaded Mozilla Foxfire 
len ratingone It works 
len ratingfive  All the star reviews and lower are haters
len ratingfive incognito mode boys
len ratingone I am part of anonymous and appreciate privacy freedom and freedom of information 
len ratingone Google is evil and google tracks if you like your privacy stay away it is funny how they changed their motto from not evil and doing the right thing to absolutely nothing there are actual investigations going on because of them getting rid of the middle man and pushing him away google sells information for what it s worth I don t pay for better service I pay for people to keep my information private 
len ratingone It is a good browser other than that 
len ratingone Although I have to commend google for trying to catch criminals and eliminate crime 
len ratingone But they are also doing other things that are very concerning 
len ratingone Also google got lucky on acquiring YouTube 
len ratingone That is the very reason I sometimes don t use it ever since google took over to be completely honest they are taking over anything and everything they can 
len ratingone Soon we won t have any privacy at all 
len ratingfive Well I kind of use CHROME every day 
len ratingthree  hmmmm with that rating and the customer reviews I ve read I hope that the product design team gets things right 
len ratingone This app has started freezing on iPad and iPhone daily 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingfive  It s awesome but a hard to get pass the the bugs but it s worth it
len ratingone After about identical user forum posts on the same issue not a single one including any info on how to resolve it I just had to delete the app 
len ratingone Lack of any real support infrastructure is a disaster 
len ratingfive The best fastest consistent browser on the market 
len ratingfive Go GOOGLE 
len ratingfour Love this app but a lot of times when u press back to go to the previous page it jumps pages back instead and it s very annoying 
len ratingfour Please fix
len ratingone There s no option of blocking ads 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Until I can use content blockers like in Safari no way 
len ratingone Just deleted 
len ratingone Will check back in months 
len ratingtwo Esta app me quiso entrar un virus a mi telefono
len ratingtwo  No integrated Adblock function means half the sites I visit are covered in pop ups and intrusive ads 
len ratingtwo Not a pleasant web surfing experience 
len ratingone I have stopped using Chrome because of their AMP accelerator constant intrusion harassment and obstruction of the iOS quick scroll to the top feature while browsing 
len ratingone The so called AMP accelerator is not faster neither accelerates anything 
len ratingone I now use the Kiwi browser or Firefox or Safari or the Duckduckgo or the a Opera bruises all of which work great without AMP 
len ratingone Google keep wanting to shove this down our collective throats 
len ratingone Still no OPTION to disable after years 
len ratingtwo I looked up the two letters p and o and it automatically brought up porn sites and some things that made me feel very uncomfortable 
len ratingtwo Then my niece had a project on STD s and it brought her some inappropriate pictures of sex positions and vaginas and penis showing what it looks like 
len ratingtwo I am disgusted with that 
len ratingfive  One of the best apps to process and review information 
len ratingfive Love to use it at all times

len ratingfive  I always have to have Chrome no matter what type of phone I have 
len ratingfive Like right now I have an iPhone and I gotta have the app there s no other like it out there 
len ratingfive Thanks for a great app 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work team 
len ratingfive I just love it I can search anything I want even images or recipes
len ratingone I can t even open it I can update it so did you guys BLOCK ME because you don t like what I do if so then you are called judging 
len ratingfive Good job
len ratingfive  Who uses safari has no point in life thank you
len ratingfive Leland isbill
len ratingtwo The app shouldn t have on it 
len ratingtwo For the people that have screen time they aren t allowed to even get the app because of that 
len ratingfive Sex xxi Mmm
len ratingone I did a search for Private Browser and Google Chrome came up 
len ratingone Is this suppose to be a joke 
len ratingone Haha nit funny 
len ratingone Anybody with two good firing neurons in her his head knows that the bread and butter of Google d business is the collection and sells of people s private information 
len ratingone It s a trillion dollars per year industry surpasing petroleum 
len ratingone All Google products regardless of their claims have the privacy or a prison shower NONE 
len ratingone Oops don t drop the soap 
len ratingfour Love chrome on my desktop and laptop and I wanted to start using it on my iPhone X but it has issues and today was the last straw 
len ratingfour Sometimes pages won t load and Safari never had that problem so hack to Safari I go 
len ratingfour Ain t nobody got time for that 
len ratingone  google s products are awful
len ratingthree I m one of the few people left that still use forums for information and tech for my hobbies and it seems that the bookmarks only save the home page of the website not the forum page which I almost exclusively use 
len ratingthree I deleted the bookmarks several times made sure I saved it on the page I want I even copied the URL and pasted into the address on the bookmarks I want 
len ratingthree None of that works properly 
len ratingthree The bookmarks even have the address I want in it but homepage it is 
len ratingthree I decided to get this since safari doesn t want to load one of the forum pages I view 
len ratingthree The bookmarks work properly on it but the switch to chrome was not very impressive at all 
len ratingone  I had two youtube channels and guess what 
len ratingone The mother f that is google think they are so powerful they can delete both accounts due to unusual activity 
len ratingfive  I only use this search engine since I started using the computer and cell phones
len ratingfive Google is very good and awesome
len ratingfive Saludos he usado chrome por mucho tiempo en mi computadora personal pero desde que la compa a de internet cambi el servicio a la fibra ptica no puedo ver los videos Facebook se congela y otros problemas lo cual no sucede con la competencia lo cual me oblig a cambiar

len ratingfive Gracias por su atenci n 
len ratingfive  Hh
len ratingone I have used Chrome on everything including my iPhone for years 
len ratingone I ve love the layout the design etc 
len ratingone I didn t use the provided Safari simply because I hated the user interface 
len ratingone I picked chrome because it just looked great and looked pretty similar to their PC counterpart 
len ratingone I got a new phone and sadly had to update to this newest version 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone I understand change is good but in this instance it s not good for me 
len ratingone At least add a way to switch the interface back
len ratingone  Is appears Google is owned and run by racists and nazis 
len ratingone Be prepared for extreme bias within the google search app
len ratingfive  Craziest thing have updates apps enough then you learn again cars I no computer harder hell

len ratingone Do I have to wait a freaking year or two 
len ratingone Please fix this problem 
len ratingone I can t change my name 
len ratingone No no no no no no no no no
len ratingfive  S per nice
len ratingone Google is not the same anymore 
len ratingone Can t find things like I used to 
len ratingone  Forced me to download from the youtube app instead of defaulting to safari 
len ratingone I was given the option to open a link to the safari app or install chrome 
len ratingone When i click safari it forces me into the app store to download chrome 
len ratingone Youtube owned by google bein made to force users into downloading 
len ratingone Uncool
len ratingfive  BUT 
len ratingfive I noticed in Gmail and even in Google Notes Keep the open browser in doesn t showcase Google Chrome iOS only Safari 
len ratingfive Even the same with Google Maps 
len ratingfive And I use Google s apps religiously and solely 
len ratingfive I really don t like Apple s version of things and want all my go to apps from Google to be properly integrated 
len ratingfive If I m in Gmail iOS and I open a link I want Google Chrome iOS to open the link not Safari 
len ratingfive Same for Google Search iOS or Google Maps I want links to not even consider Safari 
len ratingfive So when I go to hand off links to my MacBook My desktop Google Chrome caught all my history on my phone 
len ratingfive That cannot happen if Gmail is opening links and defaulting to Safari 
len ratingfive There seems to be a bug with this option toggle 
len ratingfive Please fix this sucky bug 
len ratingfive I Love Google 
len ratingone Where is the Download Manager 
len ratingone Application is not opening up on iPhone
len ratingfour Please add night mode

len ratingone It s been annoying for me I just downloaded it for the second time I can t use the chrome keep saying no internet connection why 
len ratingone Please fix that
len ratingfive All i have to say is its pretty good
len ratingone This is a review on Chrome as a whole rather than just the iOS Application Privacy is a joke with Google 
len ratingone Their grubby tentacles snake all through the internet and they ve created multiple monopolies such that they practically own the internet 
len ratingone On Email Google dominates 
len ratingone On mobile Google Dominates 
len ratingone On web browsers Google Dominates 
len ratingone And Chrome like Android is just a gateway for them to track users way more accurately than if they were using a privacy respecting web browser like Firefox 
len ratingone Apparently being implemented in of websites doesn t give Google enough personal data to sell 
len ratingone At least Chrome is relatively easy to develop websites for unlike Safari

len ratingone Way less efficient and so much slower now

len ratingone I don t know why but my chrome app keeps saying it s taking up over mb of storage the a week later upto gb then I deleted reinstalled and it did the same thing please help 
len ratingone Been using Chrome since my first smartphone Motorola Droid and one of the attractions was that it was visually different than Safari 
len ratingone Another was that Chrome was simple intuitive and easy 
len ratingone Now I open Chrome and have to double check I haven t tapped Safari by accident 
len ratingone The old design was intuitive and easy to use this one not so much 
len ratingthree I use this app for everything but ever since the last update I haven t been able to use the app 
len ratingthree I tried deleting it and downloading it pack but it has been saying its already installed I turned my phone all the way off and it was back on my phone but it s still not working 
len ratingthree It s basically installing by itself but not sure what I am supposed to do 
len ratingone Totally USELESS now 
len ratingone The last update caused Chrome to freeze seconds after launch on every device I own except my PCs 
len ratingone Besides being slow it is a UI UX mess like many other Google products these days 
len ratingone It feels like product managers don t even eat their own dogfood 
len ratingone Just downloaded tried twice to open a site and it crashed 
len ratingone Deleting 
len ratingone Everytime i use it shows what i use for a split second and the goes black fix this bug p s i used it yesterday and worked
len ratingfive It s a best Browser i see it in my Life
len ratingfive  It s really good and convenient I really like the design and small Easter eggs e g 
len ratingfive  tabs dinosaur game but one thing that s super annoying and led me to leave this review is that when you click the close all tabs button there s no warning or anything 
len ratingfive I know that the history and go back exist but it s a bit annoying to go through your history when you had s of tabs open from different times and of the time I accidentally click it when the app is open and I also click on open new tab which is inconveniently next to the close tabs button at the same time getting rid of the go back button 
len ratingfive So change that d be really appreciated is to go back to all the times you closed all the tabs 
len ratingfive EDIT Nvm I found out the recently closed page is a thing 
len ratingfive  then 
len ratingfour The last update has caused nothing but headaches 
len ratingfour The chrome browser keeps freezing on my iPhone no matter what I try as a fix 
len ratingfour I finally had to install Firefox and have not had any issues 
len ratingfour Hopefully Google will fix this problem 
len ratingfour I really like Chrome with it s sync feature across devices 
len ratingfour But privacy concerns has made me worry about Chrome lately 
len ratingone  Butt
len ratingone I ve not been able to use this app since the latest update despite uninstalling and reinstalling several times 
len ratingone I hope it can be fixed very soon as this was my favorite browser 
len ratingone downloaded the new version and now it keeps wanting me to download new version again 
len ratingone Won t load most of my regular sites hoping for a fix really quick I don t want to have change to safari
len ratingone Check back for a newer version before you install 
len ratingfive I love watching por
len ratingone I don t like the aw snap thingy 
len ratingone Remove the aw snap thingy
len ratingone Was gonna download Chrome to my iPhone 
len ratingone Then I read the reviews 
len ratingone Now I won t App developers can never just leave a good thing alone 
len ratingone The quest for newer better typically leads to features look amp feel and operational methods that degrade the functionality and experience that many most 
len ratingone prefer 
len ratingone Once we upgrade we re screwed because you can t go back 
len ratingone If you ignore upgrades you eventually lose support or functionality 
len ratingone The tech industry is brilliant but too often developers go off the reservation 
len ratingone Let ME chose the features and level of service I want 
len ratingone The title says it all 
len ratingfive I like it what about you 
len ratingone Wast my time Does not work Too slow
len ratingone That is my description of this app 
len ratingone I ve been using chrome since ver 
len ratingone  basically 
len ratingone It generally works and is better than Safari 
len ratingone However since the most recent update it has been crashing 
len ratingone This will be the second install to try to correct the near continuous crashing 
len ratingone Hey Google it doesn t work and reinstalling is it isn t working either 
len ratingone I don t know what the problem is but no longer works on my iPad or iPhone S 
len ratingone Freezes constantly 
len ratingone Good lord I hate chrome now 
len ratingone It used to be great now it s bad 
len ratingone  star
len ratingone  Jim McClure has been using google maps for locations for the law he brags about how he has cameras live streaming videos live running apps

len ratingfive This app is way faster than safari
len ratingone  Freezing issue affecting Android and all versions of iOS and iPad OS including betas 
len ratingone Deistalling untill it fixed 
len ratingone Every time I open it since right before the last update it freezes and crashes within seconds 
len ratingone Fix your app 
len ratingone Eeeee
len ratingfive  on chrome for IOS i wish there was a downloads section like there is on the pc version on the IOS version you can only download one file at a time
len ratingtwo Using your google account across multiple devices still needs help 
len ratingtwo Passwords do not translate to the mobile for some reason despite being synced to the google account 
len ratingtwo This makes for a super annoying experience 
len ratingtwo I
len ratingfour  I really like the Chrome browser for numerous reasons and I will wait for as long as it takes until it is updated 
len ratingfour This has giving me a chance to use many of the other browsers and realize how much I like Chrome 
len ratingfour I have reinstalled it numerous times and basically it only runs for about one screen until it locks up 
len ratingfive  Aw man
len ratingtwo  Autofill does not work majority of the time 
len ratingtwo I will be clicking on my information and it won t work 
len ratingtwo Also when I use autofill for credit card in Shopify it makes me autofill for every slot 
len ratingtwo One time for cc number again for name and again for exp date 
len ratingtwo Also for some cards it prompts me to enter my last three digits to verify even though I ve used the card on the browser already 
len ratingtwo And when I need to verify for every slot when autofilling my cc then I might as well enter it manually 
len ratingtwo I love not getting hit with captcha for using chrome but with all these set backs it s quicker to check out with safari 
len ratingtwo This is where safari outshines any browser 
len ratingtwo Their autofill is amazing 
len ratingtwo One click and it fill outs everything 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately chrome is the worst browser in the App Store 
len ratingtwo Even Firefox and opera autofill works better 
len ratingtwo Also the refresh on this browser is retarded 
len ratingtwo Because you need the scroll down to refresh and scroll down right to close the page it s very easy to accidentally close the page when trying to refresh 
len ratingtwo Does google not know it s very common for fingers to accidentally drift right or left while scrolling up and down 
len ratingtwo Also bookmarks are so inconvenient to access these things should be accessible with a click or two at the most 
len ratingtwo With safari I just click on the url as if I was gonna type in a new url and all my favorites show up right on the main page 
len ratingtwo This is honestly the most user unfriendly browser ever 
len ratingtwo The one good thing I ll say about chrome is how it keeps you on current page when opening a new tab 
len ratingtwo Every other browser switches to the new page when opening a tab and that s the one thing I love about iOS chrome but overall very crappy browser 
len ratingtwo Would not recommend 
len ratingtwo The simplest of features 
len ratingtwo Call me back when this basic feature present in Safari and even Chrome PC is present 
len ratingtwo I won t click times to get to a bookmark 
len ratingtwo It has been saved for a reason 
len ratingtwo Quick retreival 
len ratingfour  I try to couple different ways to have my passwords transfer over to my mobile chrome app without success 
len ratingthree Does this happen to anyone else try to forward a link and a small banner with a key for saved password pops up in imessage 
len ratingthree Is this a Apple or Google problem 
len ratingone Serious performance issues after latest update 
len ratingone Latest iPhone latest OS 
len ratingone Uninstalled and reinstalled but no help 
len ratingone I love Google Chrome are used to be tolerable even with unstable bugs and occasional crashes but this recent update and with the iOS update it just freezes and is useless I ve started using alternate browser already and I really don t want to have to permanently in so please fix this
len ratingthree  Needs better communication techniques for its users 
len ratingthree Especially millenials 
len ratingthree Don t sell our information 
len ratingone  Smells
len ratingone Google is NOT your friend 
len ratingone If you like Chrome check out the Brave browser which is Chrome stripped of all its surveillance capability 
len ratingone Same look amp feel as Chrome even the extensions work on the desktop 
len ratingone I used to LOVE Chrome 
len ratingone Literally the only browser I used to use 
len ratingone It has been crashing on both my iPhone and my laptop recently 
len ratingone Now I m forced to use other browsers 
len ratingone I m So disappointed 
len ratingone Whatever they changed they need to change it back 
len ratingthree Everything is about too large in landscape 
len ratingthree Please fix this it s intolerable 
len ratingthree Other things that would be really nice Needs download options Permanent desktop view setting Ability to change text size Everything else works fine 
len ratingthree Google account integration is great 
len ratingone  Ok so i hate this app and its keep sereching a creepy picture and l did not type that
len ratingone Has become unusable now that it is constantly crashing and freezing 
len ratingone Super frustrated
len ratingone The app constantly freezes and crash 
len ratingone Been doing this since the last update 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingfive  Love It
len ratingone I used to be a huge fan of chrome but for the last few weeks it has been freezing and crashing on my iPad and also on my google phone Pixel 
len ratingone I have tried everything and still no fix so I am deleting it and will use any other browser just not chrome 
len ratingone Not sure why Google thought this was ready for release but just like some other users Chrome has become completely and utterly unusable 
len ratingone I actually had to open safari for the first time ever 
len ratingthree Isso muito bom mas aparece ter virus mas antes n o tinha isso eu tento instalar o app que fala que bom mas pago quando desinstalei voltou ao normal
len ratingone  Beware this app beams whatever is in your clipboard to the mothership when you open the app 
len ratingone I sense GDPR penalties coming
len ratingone  Why did they change it 
len ratingone It used to be so simple click on the G icon for an interesting assortment of current articles which they called cards for some reason asking Was this card helpful at the bottom 
len ratingone If I wanted to google a topic I just clicked above the articles on the bar and proceeded easily 
len ratingone Now there is NO article feed and googling is made slow and difficult as the last topic I searched for remains in the bar 
len ratingone WHY 
len ratingone So annoying 
len ratingone I want the old system back please 
len ratingone Not sure what s going on but the app keeps freezing up 
len ratingone Can t access my bookmarks 
len ratingone I ve reinstalled and still messed up 
len ratingone Come on chrome 
len ratingone I m about to switch to Firefox permanently 
len ratingone Well I love the browser till but all it does now is lockup that s a major issue 
len ratingone I have deleted it and reinstalled it with the same result 
len ratingone On to others browsers till I here you fixed it yours 
len ratingtwo The latest update freezes continuously 
len ratingfour Good app need to have an are you sure when you hit close all tabs 
len ratingfour I ve lost so many tabs and have no way to recover them because it doesn t have a restore tabs option like it does with the computer 
len ratingfour So many things lost now 
len ratingfour I can proudly say that google chrome allows me to do things safari isn t short review awesome only used sometimes 
len ratingone  to new switching tab system and incognito mode design
len ratingfour We all love chrome and for those of us iphone users know that one of our favorite feature has to be that when you scroll down you can tap on the little taskbar where the clock is on the top to automatically take you back to the top of the page 
len ratingfour I don t see why that feature is enabled on every website 
len ratingfour I noticed some website doesn t allow the tap the taskbar to scroll back to top working on some sites 
len ratingone I ve been a long time loyal user but since the last update when I open chrome it freezes for about a minute before it works again 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingone Reinstalled 
len ratingone Rebooted 
len ratingone Any website 
len ratingone Still the same problem 
len ratingone Very frustrating
len ratingone I am very disappointed in this app 
len ratingone Mainly cause I need it to use another app and it won t install and work so neither will the other app 
len ratingone I m giving no stars 
len ratingone I hope I can recant this review ASAP 
len ratingone Crashes all the time 
len ratingone  seconds after starting it it becomes unresponsive to input then closes 
len ratingone One of the recent updates has made Chrome unusable 
len ratingone The app will not load websites and will stop responding to touch on a semi regular basis 
len ratingone I will be using another browser until this is resolved 
len ratingfive U can use intago
len ratingone  Starting days ago chrome has started freezing and crashing on both my iPhone and iPad 
len ratingone It happened before and after installing the newest update and I haven t a clue why 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive  Chrome could have the possibility to have extension or install extensions 
len ratingfive The end 
len ratingfive  Review options 
len ratingthree When trying to open Chrome last night it continuously crashed immediately 
len ratingthree Gave up and went back to open it this morning and my approximately open tabs were gone with no option to restore 
len ratingthree This is a lot of cached info I m aware but just bringing this to the developer s attention 
len ratingone Google is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junkGoogle is junk
len ratingone Updated the app and it freezes every time I open it 
len ratingone I have to sit there for a minute for it to respond now 
len ratingone I don t think so 
len ratingone It also wiped out all my open tabs 
len ratingone unusable
len ratingone im reading an article in portrait orientation 
len ratingone why is that when i rotate my phone to landscape i lose my place in the article 
len ratingone seems like such a simple feature to build in 
len ratingone who would want to rotate their phone and be bounced to the top of the pg they re on 
len ratingfive  Install to iphone
len ratingone I have an iPhone s and since the latest update the browser freezes for seconds upon first interacting with the browser 
len ratingone I have tried swipe closing the app making more memory on my iPhone by deleting old apps rebooting the phone and the problem persists 
len ratingone Fix this now please 
len ratingone Otherwise the chrome browser is my preferred utility on my iPhone 
len ratingone Every time I think it s safe and I update Chrome crashes and I lose my incognito tabs 
len ratingone Every 
len ratingone Single 
len ratingone Time 
len ratingone There are other search engines out there I think it s time that I move on 
len ratingone I encourage others to do the same 
len ratingone The pull down refresh feature is by far the most annoying feature on a mobile browser 
len ratingone Google does not consider web apps and many sites that are easily affected by this 
len ratingone I have been using chrome for many years with little issue 
len ratingone I picked it because it was nothing like safari 
len ratingone Accidentally updated the app recently and now I stuck with the terrible redesign that s exactly like safari 
len ratingfive in case of privacy protection 
len ratingone Did you seriously remove the cast function on Chrome for iOS 
len ratingone Did you really 
len ratingone The icon appears nowhere on any of my pages on my iPhone so I have to keep going to the App Store searching for Chrome then clicking Open 
len ratingone What gives 
len ratingone  I use Chrome on all of machines pc iPhone and iPad 
len ratingone But the mobile version of Chrome is severely lacking 
len ratingone The latest updates for the iOS and PC consistently locks and Chrome requires a restart 
len ratingone Clearly the latest version was not tested before roll out 
len ratingone If it was it should never have been released 
len ratingone As a result I am installing a different browser and may possibly never returned 
len ratingone Each version on any OS continues to get worse especially removing useful features in previous versions 
len ratingone C mon Chrome team wake up and stop tinkering with a product that used to be near perfect 
len ratingone You have significantly downgraded your product and its usefulness 
len ratingone Extremely disappointing and sad 
len ratingone  MB of cache that can t be removed 
len ratingone FIX IT 
len ratingone After opening the app on my iphone it starts to freeze on input of any text this takes about minute for it to unfreeze and then it starts working as normal 
len ratingtwo I love chrome 
len ratingtwo I use it on my desktop all the time but all of a sudden it freezes every time it opens a page 
len ratingtwo It force shuts down and closes all your open tabs 
len ratingtwo Serious bugs with this version that need to be fixed 
len ratingthree It s a good app but you can t use ad blocker which makes the experience frustrating 
len ratingone It freezes everytime i try to open it
len ratingtwo It d be great if it didn t crash constantly
len ratingone Now it s too bug y to use 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingone Stop trying to change what works just for the sake of saying it s new 
len ratingone This app is too involved and complex 
len ratingone I just need a simple search engine 
len ratingone The app just seems to want to collect my personal info rather than be a quick and convenient platform to search web content 
len ratingone  everything is so cramped and u literally need to reload the page or go to the site google to get into ur settings 
len ratingone i hate this so much and it s so frustrating to even CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD 
len ratingone i recommend to just use ur computer for anything on chrome because this will not get u anywhere 
len ratingfive  It s a great browser 
len ratingfive Is it possible to add a Browsec extension for Mobile iPhone IOS systems such as what is found in desktop computers
len ratingfour It is a really good platform to find what you need without trouble but it will crash randomly whenever I m in it
len ratingone Useless now 
len ratingthree  There have been times when chrome crashes and I lose all the pages I had open 
len ratingthree As far as I can tell there is no ability to just restore the session 
len ratingthree This is beside the additional pop up message to restore when you open the app again 
len ratingthree A feature I would desperately like to see 
len ratingone The update is horrible 
len ratingone I can t even get it to load 
len ratingone It locks up every single time 
len ratingone Won t restore tabs from the crash won t let you do ANYTHING 
len ratingone You MAY get lucky enough for it to accept one button press before it locks up but that s all 
len ratingone Bring back the old version 
len ratingone I use quite a few tabs and many sites requiring login 
len ratingone All of my saved passwords are cleared out and I have to type them all back in again 
len ratingone Very inconvenient update 
len ratingone Avoid if you aren t good at remembering passwords 
len ratingone Very horrible side down refresh 
len ratingfive  Thank you for the new update 
len ratingfive  Omg this app is just amazing 
len ratingfive No words just stars
len ratingone  The desktop version doesn t work at all if you click for the desktop version of a site it will still be the same thing
len ratingfive Thanks Jerry amp Daniela great job 
len ratingtwo Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible
len ratingone Junk takes up screen small space at bottom 
len ratingone Garbage now need old one back easy top screen menus Waiting and hopefull 
len ratingfive Jfkxudhsmxhzhhxjcjd
len ratingone It s frustrating to open another window or to even close the app and to still have sound playing 
len ratingone I have to force close the app to make it stop 
len ratingthree I just switched to iOS and I noticed that there is no font size on chrome I m wondering if the accessibility could be add 
len ratingthree Long time user of chrome desktop here I m quite frustrated to see some essential features missing in chrome iOS which are standard in most desktop browsers 
len ratingthree The ability to save a webpage as PDF this is the reason I keep going back to Safari 
len ratingthree The ability to find in a page i e 
len ratingthree Ctrl F when viewing PDF documents I m sure I ll find more and will try to keep the list updated 
len ratingone iPhone X crashing now
len ratingone Generally slower than safari tracks what you do to build a Facebookesque marketing profile and most features are worse versions of standalone websites you can bookmark to use more quickly in safari 
len ratingone Gotta ask why is this is in the App Store and who finds utility in it 
len ratingfive Better than Safari
len ratingfive  I love it
len ratingone The worst I tried opening it and it kept on glitching I have good WiFi
len ratingone  Google tilts its search results strongly in favor of its left wing bias 
len ratingone See Project Veritas interview 
len ratingone Google should be broken up and severely regulated 
len ratingtwo Used Chrome for a long time never had any issus kept from updating it for at least a year now 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately I accidentally updated it 
len ratingtwo  Stupid AppStore Now instead of being a nice browser that worked like Chrome it is Safari which I explicitly downloaded this app to not have to use 
len ratingtwo Not sure whether I will continue using the app or just get another one 
len ratingtwo Way to ruin a perfectly good browser 
len ratingtwo Always improving what needs no changes 
len ratingtwo May as well use Safari now take up less phone space

len ratingone When I first got Chrome it said Someone is looking at your browser 
len ratingone I didn t get to even ready the rest because I got so scared I deleted the app and turned off my phone immediately 
len ratingone I don t really know what they meant by that but I m never downloading anything this again because know I m scared that a hacker is going to get on my phone 
len ratingtwo I ve gotten used to it but the Washington Post website crashes Chrome on iOS constantly 
len ratingtwo Any story has to be reloaded as the ads load 
len ratingfour  How do I disable the news feed suggestions 
len ratingfour Some how porn and sex news articles started popping up in mine and I m becoming a bit perturbed and might stop using it because they re getting worse 
len ratingfour I never look at stuff like that so I m a bit annoyed that chrome would allow this 
len ratingone  Good app unfortunately google wants to save all your info and save passwords 
len ratingone Do not use this app if you use Android devices it is very unsafe google s security is very weak and they are more interested is selling your info than keeping you secured 
len ratingone Scam unsafe 
len ratingone If you login to any google platform app or parent company such as you tube You will be login all the time 
len ratingone This is very unsafe and your info is open to virus and other scamers such as google 
len ratingone Try it If you are signed in in you tube 
len ratingone Go to google g mail and is going to be already open and the worst thing is that they track every movement in your phone not browser 
len ratingone SCAM safety is not their number one priority 
len ratingfive Honestly I just use this app to beat my cheeks
len ratingfive Less
len ratingone Google vs google chrome the standard always goes to the homepage 
len ratingone Simple and microphone right there 
len ratingone Chrome returns to your last page 
len ratingtwo  Love Chrome but it s not opening anymore on my ipad pro 
len ratingtwo I deleted and reinstalled but no change 
len ratingtwo sorry Google I can t use your chrome 
len ratingtwo Fix it please 
len ratingone After last update completely unusable just freezes up 
len ratingone Pretty ridiculous that a company this big could screw up so bad 
len ratingone Should never have been released like this
len ratingfive dark mode for IOS or IpadOS for chrome please
len ratingone Terrible new changes for credit card autofill recently 
len ratingone Now instead of filling out my info at once I get a CVV security check for every single field 
len ratingone Who proposed this new intrusive design and was it even tested 
len ratingone This new broken behavior cost me a limited item I was trying to purchase 
len ratingone Never using Chrome again with huge broken changes like this 
len ratingone  Hi 
len ratingone Thanks for sharing your feedback could you let us know in which website did this happen 
len ratingone Does it happen in any other website 
len ratingone Please let us know more details by creating a new thread here so we can
len ratingfive Panera at th and camelback It is my favorite place 
len ratingfive The staff is unbelievably friendly and supportive and so generous with their attention 
len ratingfive The entire store is extremely clean and cozy and such great music and tea 
len ratingfive I just love it there 
len ratingfive Thanks so much 
len ratingfour I preferred the older styles yes it may have been a little hard to load but still 
len ratingfour I would like the see more button back along with the option if you click on a picture it would full screen it and it would stay full screened even if you changed pictures thats all 
len ratingfive  I really like Google Chrome 
len ratingfive I would recommend 
len ratingfive Thank you developers 
len ratingfive Chrome is gay
len ratingfour If you are gonna crash why don t I just use safari 
len ratingtwo I use Chrome almost always but the iPad version crashes way too much because of ads and things loading in the background on pages 
len ratingone The most biased search engine you can find 
len ratingone BOYCOTT and get bing 
len ratingone They censor right wing media or thoughts 
len ratingone This app does as much good as the steamer my dog just piled up in the backyard 
len ratingone  Every time I browse the web i get a video of some girl with out her shirt on 
len ratingone Now as a devout christian this offends me deeply because sex is a sacred act and this fr cking cr p makes me very amgry 
len ratingone I demand that the internet gets deleted 
len ratingtwo  I m not sure what happened but since last week every single time I open the app the same exact page that I ve been on some time ago pops up and replaces the most recent tab 
len ratingtwo I tried deleting all my browsing history cookies and cache but I just can t get rid of this page 
len ratingtwo I never had this issue before while using Chrome app 
len ratingone  Very horrible aNd the monthly bill they told me that I would be paying when my bill came in the mail it was extremely high and it wasn t what the policy amount stated
len ratingtwo  Airplay with videos super laggy lately 
len ratingone I made a gmail account for my psn and I wanted to verify my account using gmail but every time I click gmail it will ask my to sign in 
len ratingone After I sign into my gmail and I click gmail again after I ve signed in it would ask me to sign in again and it would not let me look at my gmail 
len ratingfive Chrome but it need some changes but I don t no what
len ratingone I want to be able to google something without getting on another app and being bombarded by their ads 
len ratingone Then you updated it and broke it to unusable
len ratingone They spy on you sell your data and censor you
len ratingfive  I Loved It
len ratingone Chrome will not save your tabs and you ll end up losing them one way or another 
len ratingone Don t bother if you re a tabaholic 
len ratingfive  Google Chrome is almost perfect just needs Adblock support and a dark theme other than that it s perfect
len ratingone It s so bad because it won t make me download google chrome I hate this dumb app 
len ratingone This app used to be good however the past few months it has been crashing within the first few minutes of using it 
len ratingone It s literally unusable at this point 
len ratingtwo Hey I m a student who used Google Chrome to do homework but I ve been trying for the past week to use it on a certain website where I have my assignments but it s lagging with the keyboard and words i write and then I try to delete one mistake and then all my writing erases this is SOOOOO FRUSTRATING 
len ratingtwo I HAVE TO TURN IN THESE ASSIGNMENTS TOMORROW 
len ratingfive When you search green in the images section if you scroll down long enough you ll find BLUE 
len ratingfive I know but BLUE 
len ratingfive GOOGLE ARE YOU DRUNK 
len ratingone You can t block cookies block ads enable do not track disable JavaScript or exercise any control over the privacy settings for your browser 
len ratingone Google chrome is a surveillance machine and I do not trust their browser 
len ratingone  Previous review Can t disable images can t add DuckDuckGo as a search engine 
len ratingfive  Faster easier to use one handed muscle cleaner look best browser for IOS thank you for updating the design 
len ratingfive Also if you can just add Adblock that ll make the browser perfect
len ratingfive  The Chrome version is good better than the app safari or google Or Firefox or DuckDuckGo So it better than those apps so yes I like it that s why ok google people that made Google Chrome is good
len ratingone Literally every thing I search i get ads on Facebook or Instagram STOP SELLING MY INFO 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome after all these years 
len ratingone Today I got a notice that Chrome is dropping me because my I pad isn t compatible 
len ratingone Probably Google realized that I am a conservative constitutionalist and am a liability politically 
len ratingone Actually I m dam mad and disappointed 
len ratingone Fortunately I m discovering other creative browsers 
len ratingone There is life beyond Google 
len ratingone It was good while it lasted that is why I m giving it star 
len ratingone  So I use to always use chrome and it s going to be hard for me to switch but this is the fourth time now that Chrome has deleted my tabs 
len ratingone I ve had multiple tabs open for important work and research and it s closed all of them 
len ratingone I know that I didn t do it because I hadn t used chrome at all today and it saved random tabs 
len ratingone I m switching to Firefox 
len ratingone They re better about security and you can keep Adblock on that browser 
len ratingone The update is horrible with my phone 
len ratingthree This is actually a great app to use for surfing the web 
len ratingthree I love the interface especially on the iOS 
len ratingthree However my problem is that there is no reader mode for when I want to read my articles and the reason I switched from Chrome to Firefox was because of the reader mode 
len ratingthree I hope the developers can integrate this option as soon as possible 
len ratingone  I need a login
len ratingfive  Like why the hell people staring google like bruh its google 
len ratingone It s a trap
len ratingfive Junior
len ratingfive Recommend
len ratingthree  There were NEVER MORE THAN lANguges spoken 
len ratingtwo ZI have grown more and more displeased with Google as a whole 
len ratingtwo Something needs to be done as Google and FB are both taking control of everything you do 
len ratingtwo Yes it is nice to have a lot of the apps the make but they are monopolizing everything on a day to day operation 
len ratingtwo I am unable to complete my online college assignments without some sort of party McGraw Hill without the use of Chrome 
len ratingtwo Give me a freaking break already 
len ratingone WHY does this browser not have an adblocker 
len ratingone I CONSTANTLY have ads that redirect the webpage and then I have to go back to the original site only to have it happen again 
len ratingone This is an obvious issue that should have been fixed by now 
len ratingfive  IF YOU HATE GOOGLE THEN YOU SHOULD GO TO HELL
len ratingone I have an iPad Pro and I can t even download it 
len ratingone It s telling me to put in my password for Apple ID and I do that then it just says I need to update billing but its free and billing is up to date 
len ratingthree This has been my main browser for a while but it needs a new look with improved UI and it really needs to catch up with dark mode 
len ratingfive Reds R G Eve T RayR R
len ratingtwo Please bring back the home button
len ratingone This app is really irritating there are a lot better alternatives 
len ratingone If you like the view as desktop feature then your out of luck cause it either doesn t work for most sites or doesn t load correctly 
len ratingfive C H E S S E
len ratingone All I have to say is wow just wow DO NOT DOWNLOAD
len ratingone Unusable app 
len ratingone Useless in my opinion 
len ratingone What s the point when you have the safari option right on your phone 
len ratingone Cannot get the update 
len ratingone Great ad for Safari 
len ratingone It used to be a great app but ever since this new format came out I have to go to the trouble of pressing translate every time I want to read a page 
len ratingone As someone who does nothing but read Chinese novels online this is very annoying 
len ratingone I wish I never updated this app 
len ratingfive Depend quite a bit on Google 
len ratingfive Makes me feel like I know what I m doing 
len ratingfive So many questions but great answers from Google 
len ratingfive Just did Hawaiian State Taxes thanks to help from Google 
len ratingone  Now this update won t allow me to access the app 
len ratingfour Devon was suede
len ratingfour Just downloaded the app it s very useful and I think it has potential to be on my laptop
len ratingone Washington Post article the author stated that he is not using Chrome anymore due to Google tracking recording and selling everything that you do 
len ratingone Even allowing the government to spy on you 
len ratingone I have done more research on Google a company embroiled in privacy issues and I am not going to be using any Google products anymore 
len ratingone Safari Firefox Brave the safest browser are better options 
len ratingfour Chrome is a great browser but it s not well optimized for Apple devices 
len ratingfour Its kindda slow and not really intuitive 
len ratingthree I used to love the Google app but after the update I hate it 
len ratingthree It looks just like Safari 
len ratingthree If I wanted to use the platform of Safari I d use Safari 
len ratingfive We love the shirts we ordered 
len ratingfive They fit great 
len ratingfive We would buy more 
len ratingfive Love the quality and how long the shirts last 
len ratingthree The new update has made we re the search bar jumps when your searching google will lose your entire search and go back to the last search you made and it will completely crash on some graphics searches 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingone Does anyone know how I can use chrome it won t let me open it anymore was there an update or something 
len ratingone I have an iPhone and this has never happened
len ratingfour  Absolutely need an option for permanently keep desktop view on 
len ratingone I ve been using just chrome for years until recently been going great 
len ratingone However now that I can literally not search for anything on chrome without ads popping up for my search especially if it s a product 
len ratingone And this is not just on chrome it s any app I use that has ads 
len ratingone For example 
len ratingone I recently purchased a different VPN since my ISP looking at you Spectrum is terrible 
len ratingone I ve already purchased the product through no effort on chromes part 
len ratingone Now I cannot pull anything up without seeing an ad for it 
len ratingone And I do mean I cannot get away from it on any apps even after marking the ad as irrelevant 
len ratingone Pop up blockers are apparently being disabled started seeing more and more get through so I guess it s time to switch back to Firefox only 
len ratingone And please note when force fed ads over and over for products means I will never buy said product at all or ever again 
len ratingfour  Hmmm I think you need to start talking about what your problem is
len ratingone Had tabs erased after app crashed and lost all my sexy time videos thanks a lot you sorry excuse for a mobile web browser 
len ratingtwo  Well my kiddo uses this all da time It get fuSTRaTIng sometimes when he she is CURIOUS he is to scared to ask me bout da question and it gives TOO MUCH detail and not appropriate age articles DA AGE RATING IS DUM 
len ratingtwo It s been a good browser until recently 
len ratingtwo Now it just won t load certain videos 
len ratingtwo It just doesn t do it 
len ratingtwo And it s like if you go to another website to watch them it still won t load 
len ratingthree  I have the ad blocker on but it s not working the ads are still popping up fix it
len ratingone  I just got use to Chrome and loved it 
len ratingone Then hear comes Crap why they as in GOOGLE have to go and screw up a good thing 
len ratingone I hate this new update and I pray that in days it s fixed are WALA HELLO FIREFOX 
len ratingone I m tired also of loosing plus emails and I had to buy a yubikey too stop the hacker 
len ratingone But NO GOOGLE WOULD NEVER SHARE A PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN OUT FOR PLUS YEARS 
len ratingone But hey I purchased a YUBIKEY AN I LOVE IT 
len ratingone  of them as a matter of fact and I m getting more for family members 
len ratingone  I really wanted to like the Chrome app for iOS but it turned out to be counter productive 
len ratingone I use a lot of other Google apps over Apple notable Gmail and Google Maps and after a lot of prompting from those apps to use Chrome when pushing to Safari I decided to give it a try 
len ratingone After a month of Chrome usage the app options gestures buttons are counterintuitive and slow 
len ratingone For example I understand some people like to close their browsing session after but I never do sure have a close all button but why is it displayed so prominently in the app start 
len ratingone I have pressed it accidentally so many times and closed out my plethora of tabs which is really annoying 
len ratingone There s no way to recover them if you open a new tab 
len ratingone There s no option for opening tabs in background quick new tab from a current tab just to name a few others 
len ratingone Page loading is slowing and constantly reloads instead of saving page data 
len ratingone The iOS Chrome app needs a major refresh and update before I use it again 
len ratingone But right now it is counterintuitive inefficient and unproductive 
len ratingfive  I order the wrong one but this one fits the M P shield I need to reorder one for a glock 
len ratingone Please update this app again soon I m encountering the same glitch over and over again 
len ratingfour  Works good
len ratingfive  Choosing safe internet is good and listening to advice for safe environment
len ratingfive  I know who you are ok b watch me
len ratingone  This works amazing on my android phone and pc 
len ratingone Apple iOS is complete garbage and sh t
len ratingfive  It s a great app thank u it helps me a lot searching things I need
len ratingfive  Why
len ratingone  Karen please let me see the kids again 
len ratingone im begging you
len ratingfive I love this app it hides all my stuff and it s so hot omg
len ratingtwo To slow when chrome want to boot up
len ratingthree  I have the ad blocker is on but it s not working the ads are still popping up fix it
len ratingone Why is there an option to Delete Passwords in the Clear Browser History section 
len ratingone I was just clearing my browser as I do on the Chrome for Desktop and afterwards realized that all my passwords for all my sites on iOS android and desktop were deleted 
len ratingone It s a horrible design decision to put that option there where it can be so easily selected by accident 
len ratingone I literally just fat finger deleted every password I have because of this 
len ratingone Every time I use the search bar it keeps messing me up and have a weird glitch with it
len ratingfive  Turn your phone completely off 
len ratingfive Wait minutes and hold the home button down until your fingerprint or using passcode opens it 
len ratingfive Try what you were doing before it may work now 
len ratingfive You have basically rebooted your phone giving its internal programming systems time to clean up clutter and get itself organized 
len ratingfive Try to do what you wanted to do 
len ratingfive This may not fix this immediate problem but you should give your phone OFF time regularly mo depending how much you and the other people on your plan use their phones iPods iPads etc etc etc 
len ratingfive Second thing to try once you have cleaned your phone in OFF mode try using Firefox 
len ratingfive You may just decide to forget both Safari and Chrome 
len ratingfive Try it for a little while you may like it better than either 
len ratingfive OR from Firefox download Chrome again 
len ratingfive Select it and see if coming to it from another door has picked up the lost pieces and it will work as best as Chrome can 
len ratingfive Good luck from Foxy
len ratingtwo Straight Democrat 
len ratingone I use chrome religiously like pretty much the rest of the world 
len ratingone I have everything integrated on my Google but every time i try to open a pdf word document or pretty much anything it WILL NOT DO IT 
len ratingone At all 
len ratingone Period 
len ratingone PLEASSSE FIXXX before I m forced to use firefox 
len ratingfour  Xin chan thanh cam on
len ratingfive This is the top rateing but I want to rate it stars because it is a super good app to search on the app is awesome and I love it so much more than anything else YouTube stars better YeEt
len ratingtwo Chrome was my favorite browser until the last update 
len ratingtwo Now it crashes regularly again and again 
len ratingtwo Competing browsers are looking better every day time for a change 
len ratingone Among other problems 
len ratingone Google translate is now completely useless 
len ratingone There s a whole rest of the world I can t enjoy 
len ratingone And forgive me but the rest of the world seems to be a lot more culturally and morally entertaining than anything in the states right now 
len ratingone I don t know what s new 
len ratingone But it s useless 
len ratingone Oh and I got hacked 
len ratingone Thanks for that 
len ratingfour Yes somehow I pushed the wrong button s and I have missed chrome The note I just read saved up my feelings exactly
len ratingone Never received refund when I received order was wrong could not see a thing 
len ratingone Waste of money 
len ratingone You might as hell throw it on trash 
len ratingone And they never replied 
len ratingone Horrible service 
len ratingthree  Fix the ad blockers
len ratingthree Every time the app needs to update and I m in it the app freezes and kicks me out of it 
len ratingthree Then it proceeds to delete all my tabs and I have to then spend far to long getting them all back 
len ratingthree Fix this crap 
len ratingone Doesn t work piece of crap
len ratingthree I have been a satisfied Safari user for as long as I have had a computer and an iPhone 
len ratingthree I only installed Chrome because a few websites were misbehaving and on contacting their developers concerning these issues I was told that they worked better with Chrome so I installed it reluctantly 
len ratingthree I have made a valiant effort to adjust to Chrome for those websites but overall I just don t find it user friendly 
len ratingthree My biggest beef is that when I am a long way into a website and need to back out by one step when I hit the Back tab in Chrome it often backs out by about three levels at once 
len ratingthree That creates a massive headache because if I then hit Forward it skips all of those steps again landing me back where I was before hitting Back 
len ratingthree In Safari if I am a long way into a website and hit Back it takes me one step back as logically it should without the major headaches 
len ratingthree Most of the time I use Private or incognito browsing and it may be that this is why I am having some of these issues with Chrome 
len ratingthree My other beef is that Chrome drastically slows down everything on my phone especially if I am using a Bluetooth keyboard 
len ratingthree Just now I had to type most of this review very slowly because I had a music program playing on Chrome while I was typing 
len ratingthree When the program ended everything on my phone came back to normal speed so now I am able to type faster and more efficiently 
len ratingthree I will probably be deleting Chrome because I would rather have a website misbehave a little in Safari which is way more user friendly especially for screen reader users than go through the mess I m dealing with now 
len ratingthree For the record I do not use Google as my search engine for the most part because I want as little of being tracked as possible 
len ratingthree I don t know what to say to those who say that Safari is bad 
len ratingthree At least it works even if a few web developers are still married to Google or Windows and don t want their sites to cooperate with Safari and Safari is very intuitive 
len ratingthree As for the battery drain I don t seem to be having that but then most of the time I still use Safari 
len ratingthree If I find that Chrome works better when not in Incognito Browsing I will definitely uninstall it 
len ratingthree Update Well it s goodbye Chrome 
len ratingthree It s the day after I wrote my initial review of Chrome 
len ratingthree Not only do the Back and Forward tabs jump over too many steps but sometimes it goes far enough that it takes me all the way out of the website I was on and if that site included audio the audio stopped playing therefore not only did I have to find the proper tab and then find the proper program but I then had to find the proper episode get it playing and then scroll to where I was when it shut me out often near the end of a two hour episode 
len ratingthree In addition to that there seems to be no way to tell whether you are in incognito mode or not unless you open a new incognito tab 
len ratingthree I m back to Safari full time 
len ratingthree There you know whether or not you are in private browsing or not 
len ratingthree You will not be shut out of the audio stream unless you hit Pause or as occasionally anything can do it crashes 
len ratingthree I feel that three months is long enough to know if something will work for you or not and Chrome has only gotten more frustrating over the past three months If someone else wants to deal with it go ahead 
len ratingone For some reason when I was using chrome on my iPhone all of a sudden I was kicked out then when I pressed the app again it told me to sign in 
len ratingone When I pressed the cancel button it told me that I needed to purchase the app in order to install it 
len ratingone Fix this now 
len ratingone If you fix this I will make my rating higher 
len ratingtwo I downloaded Chrome days ago and am removing it today 
len ratingtwo I already have a Safari app why would I need another 
len ratingtwo I ll go back to using Google you guys messed up on this one 
len ratingfive Gracias
len ratingone  Spent a ton of money and time only for somebody to screw up putting numbers into the computer correctly upon the early return of my rental 
len ratingone Still arguing nobody can pick up a phone or get their act together 
len ratingone Terrible

len ratingthree If I find that Chrome works better when not in Incognito Browsing I will definitely uninstall it 
len ratingone I have been using Safari and Google Chrome for a while now and ever since the new update it seems like Chrome is just plain ol copying Safari 
len ratingone You can have tabs you can close tabs and everything 
len ratingone You do the same thing in Chrome and in Safari so why waste ur storage on a app that is the complete same as Safari that is already pre downloaded into ur apple device 
len ratingone Just change up Chrome so it will not be copying Safari 
len ratingone Please and thank you for reading this 
len ratingone My chrome keeps crashing after the latest update 
len ratingone Won t even fully open up 
len ratingfive The icognito works good 
len ratingfive Ouoywyygiooeb
len ratingone Aw Snap 
len ratingone This app gets only out of stars for me 
len ratingone Far too buggy for my use on the iPad 
len ratingone I love it on PC but I ve seen it show the Aw Snap screen far too many times on iPad 
len ratingone I ve emptied my cache and reinstalled the app but it still crashes on sites loading ads 
len ratingone I m not a big fan of Safari but it successfully opens the websites and doesn t crash so I guess it is now my browser of choice on iPad 
len ratingone So aw snap 
len ratingone I have to give Chrome a bad review 
len ratingone Screw this company and their censorship 
len ratingone I m out 
len ratingthree W
len ratingone  Please have the pop up blocker work I get constant ads and it s quite annoying also chrome now all drains of my battery and that s not good at all please improve and add the ability for extensions
len ratingtwo Duck Duck Go is much better and doesn t track your data or invade your privacy
len ratingthree This Chrome Browser works like magic except every time I open it the temperature of the battery of iPad went very high not the situation when I open the same page on safari
len ratingfive Warren Osborne l love chromne
len ratingone Even using google s online support I can t figure out how to switch google accounts on chrome 
len ratingone  I will not be using this company as my main source of web browsing until they become more transparent about the politically biased search results they create 
len ratingone This company has taken away the trust I had in their product 
len ratingone Well made app 
len ratingone Shame that don t be evil means training humans to be machines that adhere to what a select few consider as good 
len ratingone The mental gymnastics it must take for these pompous people to justify that the world is unfair and must be made fair by becoming tyrants over information 
len ratingone Google is becoming a concern and trying to actually control and censor the st amendment 
len ratingone I am deleting and trying to use other browsers
len ratingone Always crashes recommend google
len ratingone I just downloaded this app and it doesn t work 
len ratingone I m trying to use a website that requires google chrome and it keeps telling me I need to install it 
len ratingone It s installed and this is a brand new iPhone XR that is days old 
len ratingone Seriously frustrated 
len ratingone  Its true

len ratingfive  If you own an import vehicle specifically a Mercedes Benz you must visit Kent and Jon at Import Autowerks 
len ratingfive They are simply the best 
len ratingfive They are truly the best in Hampton Roads 
len ratingthree Chrome is my preferred browser even on iOS but it clearly hasn t been optimized for iPads 
len ratingthree The keyboard is glitchy and many times won t minimize and I have issues with the scroll function and any webpage with form entries 
len ratingthree Fix these and we re golden
len ratingone It just quit playing mp files 
len ratingone Used to play fine but no more 
len ratingone Bush league product
len ratingone Tracks your every move and influences political searches 
len ratingone Ever since I watched the WEBTOON on Internet Explorer and google chrome I never really realized that Google Chrome was basically destroying Internet Explorer and never realized that Google Chrome was really slow as well
len ratingone No stars 
len ratingone Just downloaded the updated Chrome and every time I try to open the app it wants me to download it again 
len ratingone Hola no puedo recuperar mi contrase a de google
len ratingone uninstalled 
len ratingone not looking to have content curated 
len ratingfive So I only downloaded chrome to play the T rex run game and was not disappointed 
len ratingone  Used chrome happily for years but in the past two noticed performance steadily eroding while ad tracking increasing exponentially 
len ratingone I locked down all the settings I could within my phone on the google site and on the ad council and other sites but still the cookies multiplied 
len ratingone The browser has worked less reliably over the past two years with slower and slower loading and multiple reloads while reading and finally freq crashes 
len ratingone I used to be ok with googles tentacles in everything but something has changed now and I no longer feel they have much of any interest in providing a quality product anymore they are all about exploiting the data they collect on users and I m fed up now 
len ratingone I am deleting chrome in favor of Firefox and no longer use google as my search engine and I m going to transition off gmail in the coming months it will be a huge job 
len ratingone Google is eating itself and I no longer want to be on the menu 
len ratingone I cannot in good conscience recommend this browser because of the company it represents 
len ratingone Google has been caught saying that they want to control what information their users can see 
len ratingone If it doesn t fit their way of thinking it will not be recommended in their search engine 
len ratingone As an American citizen I feel that this is an attack on my country and it s values 
len ratingone Delete this browser and stop using the search engine that has been built by terrorists 
len ratingone Start using something like DuckDuckGo or Bing instead 
len ratingthree I ask a lot of questions and it seems that most people cannot answer them so I turn to the helpful Google 
len ratingthree However beginning about the end of May my Google Chrome has not worked over my mobile date but all of my other data using apps have 
len ratingthree For example I will be using data in a public place and Snapchat will work but Google Chrome won t load any of my searches 
len ratingthree I only get an ERR CONNECTION TIMED OUT message 
len ratingthree I miss being able to search questions 
len ratingthree Please help 
len ratingone They are acting as a publisher and providing results and views that they want us to see 
len ratingone They are supposed yo be a platform that doesn t provide any editing to their results but they do 
len ratingone This company needs to be dismantled and placed as a publisher 
len ratingthree Chrome is a good search engine but it has a lot of bugs 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingone Searching with google is akin to inviting a spy into your most private thoughts and activities 
len ratingone Use Ecosia 
len ratingone Use Duck Duck Go 
len ratingone Work with a search engine that respects you 
len ratingone  Why can t Bookmarks be accessed on it s own tab 
len ratingone Along the lines of Safari or Opera s Speed dial 
len ratingone This is a deal breaker for me and the fact google refuses to address this blatant UI UX flaw is astonishing 
len ratingone Moving to another browser 
len ratingthree N o mais r pido que o Safari 
len ratingthree  lerdo 
len ratingthree S tenho o app instalado pela fun o de Traduzir s p ginas da web 
len ratingthree E a sincroniza o do Google 
len ratingfour I like Chrome but when I zoom in on a web page to view smaller text my screen goes almost half white 
len ratingfour It really is a bummer 
len ratingfour I try flipping my phone to landscape and back because that sometimes fixes the issue but most of the time it doesn t get any better 
len ratingfour Please fix this in the next update 
len ratingtwo Such an awful idea 
len ratingtwo Hope you are listening to your users 
len ratingtwo After my last update I stopped receiving gmails 
len ratingtwo No one could fix it 
len ratingtwo I did have to move on to Safari 
len ratingone Chrome welcomed trackers even at websites you would think would be private 
len ratingone I watched Aetna and the Federal Student Aid website set cookies for Facebook and Google 
len ratingone They surreptitiously told the data giants every time I pulled up the insurance and loan service s log in pages 
len ratingone And that s not the half of it 
len ratingone Look in the upper right corner of your Chrome browser 
len ratingone See a picture or a name in the circle 
len ratingone If so you re logged in to the browser and Google might be tapping into your Web activity to target ads 
len ratingone Don t recall signing in 
len ratingone I didn t either 
len ratingone Chrome recently started doing that automatically when you use Gmail 
len ratingone Chrome is even sneakier on your phone 
len ratingone If you use Android Chrome sends Google your location every time you conduct a search 
len ratingone  If you turn off location sharing it still sends your coordinates out just with less accuracy 
len ratingtwo Why isnt this compatible with Samba live it makes my ipad useless
len ratingone Read a review of how Google continuously uses chrome to monitor you throughout your searches and use of the internet 
len ratingone No thank you Spyware 
len ratingone Chrome has changed into an Ad based surveillance browser that no longer respects its users 
len ratingone I encourage everyone I know to get firefox 
len ratingone  I don t like Google because they suppress conservative free speech 
len ratingone They should stop imposing their left wing bias and allow legal speech 
len ratingone Also a recent study shows that Google Chrome is basically surveillance software 
len ratingone Time to switch 
len ratingtwo Since the last update Find on Page has been buggy on several websites including DeviantArt 
len ratingtwo It will highlight words but won t scroll to focus on them meaning you have to swipe up and down the page finding them manually so it s basically useless 
len ratingtwo It works just fine on those same pages in Safari and Firefox for iOS so it s definitely a Chrome problem 
len ratingtwo This review regarding the external part of the business was lousy not one bit of communication from the pest control person 
len ratingtwo No updates No conformation on how many traps were set No honestly on how many pets were caught No questions to be answered As far as the internal Was able to find one person that would at least offer to give us a glimpse of what was going on 
len ratingtwo And then billed without notice before service was completed 
len ratingtwo WOULD NOT RECOMMEND 
len ratingfive  Yeah Jersey
len ratingone I have had my step granddaughter get into my computers her name is dusty Elmore she is not to be on my accounts ca n you fix this now thank you Delores Cumber
len ratingfive Juan Xito
len ratingone Thank you Google team to make it so dam hard to turn it off 
len ratingfive I will not take no more I m going to destroy the corruption now
len ratingfour when i try to move the location of my tabs by dragging it it gets sent all the way to the back and i have to wait to drag it to the front 
len ratingfour at least safari won t automatically send it to the back or where ever 
len ratingfour can you fix that 
len ratingthree The find in page option does not work 
len ratingthree I type something in and no results are displayed when there are supposed be actual results being displayed 
len ratingfive The new update is only bad words
len ratingfive  J aime Google chrome
len ratingfive  Google
len ratingone In my iPhone settings I have location blocked 
len ratingone But in the app it has my legitimate precise location 
len ratingone This has been a thing for god knows long and this has never been fixed how come you can get my location if I have it blocked on my settings what other settings are like this this is really concerning 
len ratingone Yes I understand that you re not ever going to get away from being known where you re at by from your phone 
len ratingone But if I set my settings for Privacy Control settings and block Location Services why does Google surpass that setting 
len ratingone Either this shouldn t be allowed or this needs to be fixed 
len ratingtwo I m not the only one with this problem 
len ratingtwo Ever since I downloaded the newest version of Chrome my screen freezes or I cannot open half the pages I visit 
len ratingtwo Colossal disaster 
len ratingtwo Whole engineering crews need to be fired 
len ratingtwo How could they have released this version 
len ratingone Okay 
len ratingone I like the formatting and everything but when I logout from one account it just goes back 
len ratingone It s very annoying 
len ratingone I have to to it at least times a day 
len ratingone Deleting this app
len ratingfive This is a great app works very well I enjoyed using it 
len ratingtwo Ive pretty much gone to Safari on my iPhone for web browsing as Chrome let s too much of the browser landscape to be filled with advertising 
len ratingtwo You can no longer distinguish between content and click bait 
len ratingtwo Why does there have to be so much advertising intermixed with web content to the point that it s no longer productive to search on my phone 
len ratingtwo It forces one to use a PC browser just to get to actual content 
len ratingtwo Chrome mobile is useless for browsing without ending up accidentally clicking on ads scattered within the page 
len ratingone When I use Chrome to Add to Bookmarks on YouTube to share a video I check Added but always fails 
len ratingtwo I have used Chrome on every iPad I ve owned 
len ratingtwo Almost useless for me now 
len ratingtwo Seriously install Puffin and run the same addresses 
len ratingtwo Just clip and and run them 
len ratingtwo No comparison 
len ratingfive  I only downloaded for the no connection game
len ratingtwo I m using an iPhone that s why we re here on the App Store 
len ratingtwo This is an Apple machine 
len ratingtwo The best PDF reader on the iphone is iBooks period but Google won t tell you that because Google doesn t support exporting PDFs to iBooks 
len ratingtwo Boys get with it 
len ratingone My iPad is old i don t have the luxury of getting apples new software chrome crashed a lot bare that but now I cannot even access it anymore I had to delete it because it was glitching only to find out I can never access the info I had on it ever again some of which was important
len ratingfour Still learning 
len ratingfour Nice to work with it
len ratingone  I love google but one thing I hate is that it s actually listening to you 
len ratingone Like I was talking about video games with my phone open and on my articles for you thing it showed up 
len ratingone Everything I pass or talk about shows up 
len ratingone I don t have location microphone or literally anything enabled so this is super creepy and I hate it 
len ratingone So google stop literally listening to us 
len ratingtwo The app keeps crashing on my iPhone for the last several days several times a day 
len ratingtwo I have to close the app and restart my phone for the app to work at all
len ratingfour I love chrome or I did until the new update 
len ratingfour I did not take the time to download chrome to have a copy of safari 
len ratingfour If I wanted to use safari I wouldn t have downloaded chrome 
len ratingfour I really wish you hadn t released the update but since you did I wish you would make it to where we can use a previous version of chrome 
len ratingone Has caused me to switch to Firefox as this change is awful and no one wants more ads online 
len ratingfour The reason why this is the best because I get to watch youtube which I don t have the youtube app so I just use this app XD but this might need a big of arrangement sometimes I want to watch youtube on the way to school but I can t because I need internet so I ask if you could fix that please I would like this a bit more
len ratingfive It s a good app 
len ratingfive I d like to thank Nate green at the west freeway location for being an outstanding salesman in my purchase of a set of brand continental tires for my black Jeep Cherokee 
len ratingfive I had never purchased anything from NTB although after yesterday that will certainly change 
len ratingfive I m a satisfied customer and will continue to do business with NTB and will tell all my family and friends about my experience 
len ratingfive Thank you NTB
len ratingfour  Needs AirPlay support for videos 
len ratingone Calm down your mad over a new design and how is it what s so called a Risk 
len ratingfive  I use it to hide my borno
len ratingfive  Flooaw EL FUEGO
len ratingone  This browser was so nice before they ripped off safari 
len ratingone Now you have to click like times to switch tabs if you have the keyboard open 
len ratingone I don t care for the new app but I do know once I get used to it it is like Indiana weather turn around and it will have changed to something else to try navigating through 
len ratingfive Also the design is fine it works perfectly normal the people yelling about the design are way to picky it does its job get over it
len ratingone Love Chrome 
len ratingone I ve used it for years on the exact same iPhone 
len ratingone Since May it crashes at least once daily on my iPhone ONLY requiring the apps deletion and reinstallation to unfreeze and make it useable again 
len ratingone Basically it s unusable on my iPhone since May 
len ratingone So I m back to Safari until they fix it 
len ratingthree It is WAY too easy to accidentally close all tabs with no undo or are you sure prompt 
len ratingthree I ve only ever done it accidentally and every time it s tabs that would be so annoying to open up one by one 
len ratingthree PLEASE implement an undo or restore all tabs feature so I don t have to go through this madness again 
len ratingfive  Aaron Tyler Norman
len ratingthree First you can just turn on and off the don t track me option but now not anymore now I am not sure we can even be free to move to insecure sites anymore please google I know my post can t change anything but please you should just make some changes in the next few days thanks 
len ratingfive This is one cool shoe that s comfy and stylish 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingthree I have the app downloaded but it s not showing up on my home screen and it won t let me open it from the App Store 
len ratingthree How can I fix this 
len ratingfive For everyone saying oh i used to love the old design more i don t like updates like that either but people act like google isnt the only app besides safari which has google too they search on so please complain less thank you
len ratingfive  The latest design syncs the look and feel of the desktop and mobile versions 
len ratingfive Easy to use and full featured 
len ratingfive Can easily disable unwanted features and continue browsing from other devices open tabs 
len ratingfive Best browser to watch porn
len ratingone Umm thanks for making Chrom almost exactly like Safari 
len ratingone Now the things I could do in just one click previously now require or even clicks and all over the screen 
len ratingone Just bring back what worked 
len ratingone I m literally shocked that you allowed this update to be release 
len ratingone What a joke 
len ratingfive I love going to my Google Chrome and to see who s been in my phone my phone my phone my phone
len ratingfour Needs iPad optimized version for better desktop like experience 
len ratingfour Please also make tabs works like desktop version where the title bars shrink to fit instead of the scrolling like safari 
len ratingfour Tabs is why I use Chrome instead of Safari 
len ratingone  does not retain private browser setting 
len ratingone useless 
len ratingfive  chrome app for iOS emails and business services emails are owned by mark aaron wortham 
len ratingfour I love google chrome and I would have given the app stars but I don t think it deserves it 
len ratingfour The reason for this is that if you accidentally hit the close all button when you re not looking at the screen you loose most of the tabs you have open 
len ratingfour I literally did this not even minutes ago on the desktop version of chrome you can re open tabs in sets instead of individually am there s a hotkey command Todo this on the app you simply can t because it has a tab recently closed tabs memory which is really inconvenient when you have over tabs open at once 
len ratingfour There are other apps that have a similar feature but they give you a pop up to make sure you meant to hit it 
len ratingfour That is all that this app needs in order to get a star rating 
len ratingone I will want to play games that sign in with google but there not my accounts and if I forget them because there old I do the forget password sign in to get the account but it s not mine I am not happy
len ratingfive When I got a chrome book I loved this app so I started watching YouTube 
len ratingfour I have been using this app for years on IPad but I really wanna move search bar to the bottom of screen so that I can reach my finger with touching keyboard 
len ratingfour Currently I need to lift my palm to touch top search bar 
len ratingfour Why don t we use the bottom part like the function bar of MacBook 
len ratingfive I love this app cause I can search stuff and a really smart app and that s all bye
len ratingfive  Dear DarkenedXavier I m sorry for everything I did to you 
len ratingfive I didn t mean it 
len ratingfive But now it s time to make my chance a deferent wiki instead of the battle cats wiki forever 
len ratingfive Any way I m very very sorry 
len ratingfive I hope you forgive me 
len ratingfive Your friend naaji blocked 
len ratingfive  Gg
len ratingfour I love that I can change tabs by swiping left or right from either the address bar or the navigation bar on the bottom 
len ratingfour Excellent feature 
len ratingfour I actually wish it was a bit more sensitive 
len ratingfour I have to swipe too long before it takes 
len ratingfour Also the Find in Page feature doesn t work as well as Safari s 
len ratingfour It doesn t scroll the part in the page where the text that you are searching is for some sites like github com or golang org 
len ratingtwo I have no choice but to update I hate the new format ugh 
len ratingone I don t sign in to google 
len ratingone App has no bookmarks toolbar and bookmarks are to hard to use 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingone Google used to be my favorite search engine and chrome used to be my favorite web browser but for the past couple months I can t use the app or the search engine if my cellular is on only once in a blue moon if it randomly decides to work 
len ratingone I literally have to turn on WiFi if I want to use it 
len ratingone Now I just use safari and yahoo search engine 
len ratingfive I love the app because it is better than safari
len ratingone So the last time I downloaded this app it had a bunch of ads about naked ladies and boys it was gross I hope it s fixed
len ratingone Make a new one this one is dope
len ratingfive I love Chrome and slowly transitioning from safari to Chrome but I want to be able to switch to Dark Mode in settings without going to the incognito 
len ratingfive Love the new chrome it s fantastic 
len ratingfive Thank you google
len ratingtwo Hello I signed up to cambly to tutor English for some cash 
len ratingtwo Was told to download Chrome 
len ratingtwo So I I did 
len ratingtwo On Chrome go to cambly website sign it go to tutor tab takes me to another link that reads download latest version of google chrome to blah blah 
len ratingtwo I click that link 
len ratingtwo App Store all up to date 
len ratingtwo What s the problem 
len ratingtwo Help 
len ratingfive I like using this app 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive Chrome never seems to fail me unless the other sites 
len ratingone IF YOU SEARCH UP ANYTHING IMPORTANT DON T KEEP IT ON HERE 
len ratingone I had several important tabs open and I just exited out of the app and that s when all of my important tabs got closed 
len ratingone I m warning you this app crashes often so it s not safe to use 
len ratingfive Chrome is the best searcher
len ratingfive  J aime google chrome
len ratingtwo Yes hello can you fix it so it doesn t reload my page and lose my place EVERY TIME I CLOSE THE APP FOR EVEN ONE SECOND it used to reload and return you to where you were but now 
len ratingone I believe Apple could be messing with Chrome because we already know Apple and Google don t play nice hence why you can t cast your tablet or your iPhone to a chrome cast device and vice versaAre used to be able to cast movies from a certain website onto my chrome cast device but it seems like apple does not let you cast any website movies to Apple TV I also noticed that I use Chrome on here in the movie takes longer to load on Chrome then it does on Safari which leads me to believe that Apple could be tampering with chrome
len ratingone Seems very unstable now and adds all over the place 
len ratingone Been using Chrome since it first came out like a decade ago look like I ll be using Safari now on my phone and on Mac 
len ratingone They are making it so you can t block adds with their browser 
len ratingone The increase in adds and likelihood of getting malware or virus the increase in instability Google s lack of privacy their lack of supporting freedom of speech on YouTube 
len ratingone Google is going down the drain 
len ratingthree  I m giving this three stars because I liked the previous version but the new design is one of the most confusing moves Google could have made 
len ratingthree Even more befuddling than an out of context mashup of Arrested Development episodes 
len ratingthree As someone else said why would you make a browser that s a copy of the one pre installed on the phone 
len ratingthree If people used the previous version what in the eternal hell of misused Autotune would make you think people preferred what they already had 
len ratingthree What 
len ratingthree Even disregarding that why why why why would you think that drastic design changes people can t choose between were a good idea 
len ratingthree Dude why 
len ratingthree What in the name of giant snakes do you think people are going to think of that 
len ratingthree  Hey I sure do love this new look Google forced on a perfectly functional app No you lobotomite orangutans in zoot suits people like choice 
len ratingthree I wonder if there s a way to rate Google s quality control system 
len ratingthree Perhaps they should turn their attention to removing Elmer Fudd from R D 
len ratingfive  Pee
len ratingone Play music doesn t work since upgrade 
len ratingone My phone does not see my chrome device 
len ratingone  Chrome 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo It s not good it s terrible because the old swipe to remove tabs isn t there otherwise you really need to update and make services faster
len ratingone Chrome is STILL susceptible to popups and redirects 
len ratingone Feels like browsing circa 
len ratingtwo App now freezes all the time since last update 
len ratingtwo Tried rebooting iPhone and router 
len ratingtwo Didn t work 
len ratingtwo Not happy because google is my main web browser 
len ratingfive I love chrome but you guys always snatch my tabs every now and then I always report it but I never get a reply or get them back I lose a lot of stuff Nvm found all of my tabs that got snatched in my recent tabs thingy
len ratingfour  I think I will use this app more it is perfect I love it 
len ratingfour The only thing is it s the same as safari so if you don t like that not recommended 
len ratingone Cannot open links when searching google the new design is not the best but not being able to click on a link is FRUSTRATING 
len ratingfive This app is great and the design is just great 
len ratingfive But still needs some improvements to the privacy 
len ratingfive But it s a great app if you one of those people that like new refreshed design 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfive I bet anybody who gets it will be surprised 
len ratingone Chrome is my go to browser but this new version is so frustrating 
len ratingone The list of results after a google search are formatted in a really confusing way 
len ratingone Each one is in a rectangle that takes up a lot of space and the url for each one is tiny so you have to really look to see the source of each one 
len ratingone There doesn t seem to be a way to change the formatting 
len ratingfive Jj
len ratingtwo Half the time I open this app to search in the Omni bar it fails to load the search regardless of if I m on cell service or WiFi 
len ratingtwo I ditched this for Firefox and I m never going back 
len ratingone I noticed my battery seems to be going down very rapidly lately 
len ratingone Lo and behold the Chrome app is the issue 
len ratingone  battery used while I was asleep it was force closed and there is no longer an option to take off the background app refresh 
len ratingone Used to love google but their shortcomings are getting old 
len ratingone Get your crap together Google
len ratingfour Seriously just do it everyone would love a dark mode on this app 
len ratingfour For the upcoming IOS it ll really fit in 
len ratingfive excellent browser
len ratingtwo  I tried to open a pdf form from a site using chrome but i couldn t find open in and could not use my pdf app to open in 
len ratingtwo I was only able to use it using safari 
len ratingtwo Why dont you add open in app like pdf app or other apps 
len ratingtwo Add this as i do not want to use safari as a sideline just to be able to use that option 
len ratingone If you use chrome in a daily basis this is a star app 
len ratingone Otherwise you can say its stars 
len ratingone If you wanted a quick non bloated ad free browsing experience chrome used to be a no brainer 
len ratingone Not so much anymore 
len ratingone Firefox is now my browser of choice 
len ratingone Notice how you can t review google with google reviews 
len ratingone They know they d get a terrible rating 
len ratingone  I went to epic games website then it took me to a sex and love page
len ratingfive I use it a lot
len ratingfive Thank you for helping me retrieve my Google Chrome account 
len ratingfive Easy prompts and help to get my account going 
len ratingone I hate it because I was delete it a account and now all my history is gone
len ratingtwo I used this app before changes now it is difficult to navigate
len ratingfive The new design is perfect and a lot easier to navigate no complaints here
len ratingone Um 
len ratingone It ok hmm this is I don t no about this program so I hate this 
len ratingfive  thanks
len ratingone Why isn t this compatible with my Ipod 
len ratingone I used it last night accidentally deleted it and I can t redownload it 
len ratingone what s the deal 
len ratingone Update is unbearable
len ratingtwo Your app keeps closing my opened tabs 
len ratingtwo Please fix it s anoying 
len ratingfive  Fred Montgomery
len ratingone I do agree with the other user everything he said is right FIX YOUR APP
len ratingfive Love the app
len ratingfive  Review Optional 
len ratingtwo  This
len ratingone Chrome crashes way to much these days 
len ratingone It cannot handle pages with too many ads maybe 
len ratingone It s been a nice few years 
len ratingone Bye 
len ratingone Okay they need to fix the startup screen because it scares me a lot and the start up screen isn t like the other google apps startup screens YouTube is the exception 
len ratingone If they fix it then I d not be scared any more
len ratingthree Please
len ratingone Safari is better
len ratingone Can we please fix the issue where it says something went wrong when I m creating account when I click the I agree button 
len ratingone It s ridiculous how I cannot make an account 
len ratingone I ve even tried on safari which I usually don t use 
len ratingfive This app makes my everyday browsing fun and easy 
len ratingfive I like the new tab layout 
len ratingone I tried to cancel and it won t let me
len ratingone i ve used this app for years but recently i ve been getting frustrated every time i open it 
len ratingone i absolutely cannot stand the fact that every search link opens in a new tab 
len ratingone this didn t happen before but now i can t browse without having links open automatically 
len ratingfour Animal AR takes long to open the page not to load to simply go to the webpage and sometimes doesn t work
len ratingone Can t read it 
len ratingone Ads for the first pages 
len ratingone You made it worse 
len ratingone Firefox is my new browser 
len ratingfour  I had a bottle of wine and I forget to get my wine opener 
len ratingfour The front desk brought his opener 
len ratingfour I wish they add breakfast and parking included in booking 
len ratingfour Thank you all 
len ratingone Done with google chrome because of greed 
len ratingone  Switching back to Firefox 
len ratingone Nothing has made me more uncomfortable 
len ratingone I ll be switching to something else until google comes to their senses 
len ratingone If i wanted to use a safari like browser i would ve just kept using safari instead 
len ratingone They show u what they want u to see and not what u want to see 
len ratingone They will put things that they have sponsored and most of the time it s not related to what ur searching for and it s annoying 
len ratingone I used to enjoy using Google Chrome 
len ratingone It was fast accurate and it s features were cool too 
len ratingone But recently Google has decided to only allow people in their company to use ad blockers 
len ratingone This may seem like a small change now 
len ratingone But it s possibly a percursor to worse 
len ratingone Rumors spread that companies considered charging people for using the internet 
len ratingone So this could also be an invasion of our rights 
len ratingone They make money with their browser apps and communities 
len ratingone Why should they make you do more to give them more profit 
len ratingone With this in mind I ve started using Yahoo to search online and have deleted the Chrome app for Firefox 
len ratingone So please understand when I say that Chrome is not the best and I give it no star ranking 
len ratingone Oh 
len ratingone They won t let me post unless I do 
len ratingone One star and not a single other 
len ratingtwo Please give us the option to get the predictive text bar back and turn off the auto fill shortcuts I use predictive text all the time but don t want those shortcuts there all the time 
len ratingone Be careful Google plans on blocking ad blockers in the near future 
len ratingone Bye bye chrome 
len ratingone I m switching to Firefox 
len ratingone It s not working at ALLLL I can t access things without it but it doesn t work so I can t access anything AT ALL 
len ratingone It s a really good app
len ratingfive I love using it so much I use it so much and it s so amazing and I love it
len ratingone It s crazy 
len ratingone I need to zoom out so I can see more on the screen at once 
len ratingone It works on the laptop but not on the ipad 
len ratingone Please update this 
len ratingone Google is changing their extensions system to break ad blockers except to enterprise accounts 
len ratingone Uninstalled there are so many alternatives that are just as good if not better at this point
len ratingfour It will stop working if it translate the web
len ratingfive Google can virtually do anything
len ratingtwo I use Chrome of the time 
len ratingtwo Since March Chrome will close all my open tabs and not prompt to restore or doesn t allow me to any tabs under recently closed 
len ratingtwo I ve lost around saved open tabs this way 
len ratingfive Micah Dattel 
len ratingtwo Trying to copy paste URLs from sites Adds the google search site link in front of the actual site 
len ratingtwo Very deceptive 
len ratingfive  The mighty Google Chrome web browser is my favorite place to go and surf the web on my Chromebook computers 
len ratingfive Apple Safari is not a smart default web browser on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is directly the opposite of Apple Safari on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Google Sheep me reported that each update on this Google Chrome app keeps the app itself safer and easier to use with new features and bug fixes 
len ratingfive Nice job on your part Google in bringing this Google Chrome app on the App Store 
len ratingfive It stinks that you Apple Inc doesn t come as close to my web standards when it comes to my way of surfing the web 
len ratingfive When I opened it it went right to the website i wanted to get on
len ratingfive  h
len ratingone Chrome used to be my go to 
len ratingone This latest update is absolute trash 
len ratingone Any search result returns a page full of Ads or sponsored links before anything useful or an actual search result appears 
len ratingfour  I don t understand why there s Google Chrome and Google when they re both the same thing 
len ratingfour It s literally a dupe 
len ratingfour I just don t understand the point 
len ratingfour I mean there s nothing wrong with that 
len ratingfour If that s y all preference go ahead 
len ratingfour Y all do great at y alls job and I m proud 
len ratingfour Keep up the good work but remember I am still questioning why to have two of the same app 
len ratingfive  Pienso que la Compa a solo muestra su producto es una el probarlos si no estamos tengo la opci n de serrarla 
len ratingfive I tried Shopbrain app and was impressed with the result 
len ratingfive It helps me to save time in browsing and looking for a good deal because it automatically compared prices so I don t need to open each store website just to compare 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingtwo I used to love chrome I wouldn t use any other internet app on my phone 
len ratingtwo Yet now it is ever more becoming a clunkier version of the hated Safari 
len ratingtwo I also have now had several instances where all of my tabs disappear without a trace 
len ratingtwo Nothing appears in recently closed no group of tabs that have been recently closed 
len ratingtwo I like to keep those tabs open for a reason 
len ratingtwo Hope google gets their act together soon 
len ratingfive GUYS I LOVE THAT
len ratingone I made a mistake and I paid so I wanted to be back I would like it to be refunded please thank you
len ratingfive Fcchysxmj
len ratingone  Why is Chrome for iOS so horrible 
len ratingone Chrome on Android is so much better and resembles the desktop versions Chrome OS MacOS Windows 
len ratingone Chrome for iOS has an odd and awful design 
len ratingone Please make it look like the Android counterpart 
len ratingone Title says it all 
len ratingone I m going back to Safari 
len ratingone Trying to navigate through google with this app is frustrating 
len ratingone I don t remember having this much grief in using this application 
len ratingone Chrome was my go to browser now I feel it is not as user friendly as safari 
len ratingthree Ugh 
len ratingthree This was one of the reasons I hated and deleted the Chrome app years ago 
len ratingthree You had it fixed 
len ratingthree Now with this latest update I am seeing that again 
len ratingthree When I switch between tabs it should be seamless 
len ratingthree Why does the tab not only have to reload but also give this silly black and white screen for a second before reloading 
len ratingthree That is a very odd design 
len ratingthree And like I say it was gone 
len ratingthree The last version worked perfectly 
len ratingthree Please please fix this back 
len ratingone I would love keep this browser on my phone but this app drains battery even when I am not using it 
len ratingone  Fuck 
len ratingone The Open In function for PDF viewing does not work correctly on Chrome for iPad making it extremely difficult to use on my iPad without having to pair it with Safari or my Mac 
len ratingfive I love chrome despite the other things reviews may say 
len ratingfive Chrome is great and it deserves a place on my iPhone 
len ratingfive I refuse to use safari it is so weird 
len ratingfive I personally use chrome on all my Devices everyday and it is a great experience 
len ratingfive So all of you hating on chrome just because it looks different just stop and don t use it but stop trying to stray peoples beliefs before they even get it 
len ratingfive  Sincerely Growlie
len ratingfour  One time I had airplane mod on and it showed the T Rex I clicked on it and started running what is this 
len ratingone This just was not good I wanted to search something but now I cannot because I couldn t work it and it would not let me down lode it
len ratingone i have always preferred chrome to safari but with the recent updates it s become a nightmare to use 
len ratingone it brings up unrelated information the icon for the websites is very distracting and i can t find anything i m looking for because of the ad websites 
len ratingone unfortunate 
len ratingfive Add Theme color tag
len ratingone There are bugs everywhere
len ratingone Title says it all 
len ratingone New design makes no sense 
len ratingone I don t know why someone thought it was a good idea to change the standard layout for search results but I hate it 
len ratingone I actually think I d prefer to use Bing instead 
len ratingone  Every time I click a new link it opens up a new tab instead of opening in the same tab 
len ratingone Extremely annoying 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingthree Yep
len ratingone You can t pick what you want to read and the set up is nothing like it was 
len ratingone I used to go in every day now why bother 
len ratingone Why can t you just leave things alone 
len ratingone No one asks us how we d like it 
len ratingone Someone decides for us as usual and it stinks 
len ratingone Another unhappy people go add to the list 
len ratingfive Helps a lot when researching and facts it s awesome
len ratingone Chrome recent update filled with great features is fantastic except for the new UI searching page 
len ratingone The UI design when you searched for something is just simply horrible 
len ratingone I thought everything was ads clicks 
len ratingone So ugly that I no longer wanted to stay on Chrome 
len ratingone It s like the UI and UX department is smoking pot in the back and not doing their jobs properly 
len ratingfive  It is fun
len ratingone New Mexico
len ratingone I can t disable enough features or use Private VPNs to not have show my exact location in search listing 
len ratingfive Thank you now I can use translations again 
len ratingfour Chrome needs to bring back the feature of syncing chrome saved passwords with iCloud Keychain 
len ratingfour That would give it stars 
len ratingthree Chrome is my lifeblood for searching 
len ratingthree I ve been using it on the computer and my iPhone for years but now there is an annoying feature to the app 
len ratingthree It always opens a new tab when clicking links now which at least for me is frustrating 
len ratingthree It virtually nullifies the previous page arrow and leaves my browser full of tabs I don t want to see 
len ratingthree I know it may be petty but I just cannot stand this new feature 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingfive I waited minutes on hold for help only to be told you couldn t take my call 
len ratingfive Why am I having to log on and resign up 
len ratingfive Everything was fine before this change 
len ratingfive So here I am not able watch YouTubetv due to technical issues and nobody to help 
len ratingfive Hello hello is there anybody there who gives a crap about customer service 
len ratingfive Monday is a holiday by Tuesday morning I hope to have heard from you or I will be cancelling my account if I wait that long 
len ratingfive Oh BTW MY MONEY IS ALWAYS ON TIME why aren t you with answering your phone 
len ratingfive You get negative stars 
len ratingone It gets to the open page after download and then locks up 
len ratingone Have removed and installed again same thing 
len ratingone Terrible update please go back 
len ratingone Interface is much too wordy 
len ratingone So difficult to use hard to easily find a hat you want to do 
len ratingone Also silly me isn t an app something you use as a convince 
len ratingone This is not so far
len ratingfive Hi 
len ratingtwo I downloaded Google Chrome for my iPhone and was really enjoying it as I could access bookmarked sites utilizing my saved passwords for most until recently when bookmarks were no longer accessible from my iPhone which put me at a loss when I needed access to certain site information 
len ratingtwo I hope you can fix this problem as I m an avid Google user 
len ratingfive Simplemente chrome haciendo su trabajo el navegador nativo de iOS es bueno pero no tiene la rapidez y las funciones de la estrella de Google 
len ratingfive Chrome en todos mis dispositivos y a navegar 
len ratingfive Dear creator I like it but put the original and fix all the browsers issues okay From 
len ratingfive  I m
len ratingfive  I Have It On My Laptop And It Can Give You Websites Like Minecraft
len ratingone Horrible setup like it s apple 
len ratingone I enjoy my apple phone but not the Safari part so I download everything that s Google for easier navigation ND now it s the same as the apple web I ll rather stick to Safari then to fill my memory up a look alike not comfortable at all my kids ask me why I always download everything Google on an apple phone I just thought the navigation was much calmer and easier to understand and I m used to having an Android so I just wanted the same features but now it s just annoying as Safari and the bar at the bottom is idk lol just change it back lol I m very upset I love Google apps 
len ratingone  Old google chrome was pretty good 
len ratingone Here s a list of things I found from the ten minutes I spent trying to use the updated version before giving up in absolute fury my tabs are all boxed so they re displayed like icons instead of full page swipe ups 
len ratingone As are my incognito tabs 
len ratingone Believe it or not I don t actually want increased readability at a distance for things I didn t want other people to see 
len ratingone  I thought I accidentally opened safari to start 
len ratingone The site bar at the top is small and hard to X aesthetically displeasing and best of all I can t get rid of it 
len ratingone This pairs with my next point menu bar is now on the bottom and automatically hides 
len ratingone The whole f king reason I didn t like safari is because using a menu bar at the bottom was unwieldily and annoying that s the whole reason I downloaded google chrome 
len ratingone And because so many people downloaded google chrome over the default app they decided they should become more like the default app 
len ratingone Not clever 
len ratingone  I can take pictures and upload them directly to google 
len ratingone Which would be neat if I didn t want to lobotomize myself after using the app for more than seconds 
len ratingone  the websites now look markedly different in mobile versus web version and there s too many steps between to get the web version 
len ratingone I thought that was a individual website thing but even websites I ve been on before look different now 
len ratingone  I can t remember if there were ads on the last version 
len ratingone I believe there were but they were subtle 
len ratingone There is definitely ads on this version it looks almost like a pop up bubble from you guessed it 
len ratingone The bottom of the screen 
len ratingone So it s easy to tap an ad instead of the menu bar 
len ratingone So easy I m almost inclined to say making ads harder to avoid was the whole reason for the change but maybe they really did just want to infuriate their user base 
len ratingone  Now normally what I would do is restore from last backup and look for alternatives 
len ratingone However this app update came because my phone crashed and then decided it could update iOS without my permission and in doing so also updated all my apps also without my permission so I don t have a recent enough backup 
len ratingone So I m going to download Firefox and see if I can use that and safari in the interim 
len ratingone Google chrome is already pretty suspect about what info it keeps but I kept using it because it was the easiest to use app 
len ratingone Now I m happy to obliterate it from my phone and memory and you should too 
len ratingone Give my old chrome back 
len ratingone  Personally I use chrome on my PC so I wanted to use the app just because it has all my saved information already but the app looks really weird 
len ratingone It s almost as if it was made for the elderly 
len ratingone The bottom toolbar is way too big and overbearing 
len ratingone And it also looks unflattering compared to the rest of google s design choices which are usually sleek and minimal 
len ratingone The fact that the first tab is on the top left and is only close able by using the tiny x at the top right of it is super user unfriendly 
len ratingone Why would anyone remove the swipe feature on an app browser if they are going to show show a mini tab preview in the tabs section 
len ratingone The swipe features in the tab mode are also unnecessary 
len ratingone If I wanted to use private mode I could just enter it manually through a button somewhere 
len ratingone I don t need it to replace the swipe to close tab feature 
len ratingone Also there is a weird bug where if you sync your chrome bookmarks with your phone the icons of the bookmarks disappear and turn to a weird gray earth type thing on both devices 
len ratingone Also when you swipe down on a new tab to reveal the three commands that are either refresh close tab or make a new tab it sometimes works and sometimes doesn t 
len ratingone This is very inconsistent 
len ratingone Sometimes I have a smooth experience using the commands but other times it just doesn t even work at all 
len ratingone  I had used it for translation but after update it stopped
len ratingfive  thanks
len ratingone I can t see one simple document without it redirecting me every single time i try to Clear Cache and Cookies support page 
len ratingone GOOGLE CHROME IS AN IDIOT 
len ratingtwo I run this on IOS 
len ratingtwo Used to be able to turn the phone degrees and observe web pages with more room for text 
len ratingtwo This feature is now gone 
len ratingone Every link I click on opens a new tab 
len ratingone I have tried everything through settings including blocking pop ups and resetting to default settings 
len ratingone Stupid and annoying bug that makes me have to close tabs at the end of the day 
len ratingone PROBLEM chrome opens a new tab every time I click on a google search result and I can t fix it 
len ratingone It makes it inconvenient to go back to search results and leaves me cluttered with too many tabs 
len ratingone The new interface is also terrible and functions are inconveniently placed 
len ratingthree I love google software but unfortunately Safari has better speed and experience by far on ios 
len ratingfour I only use this web browser 
len ratingfour Unfortunately if I close the application and reopen it it switches to my incognito tabs 
len ratingfour That defeats the point of having incognito tabs 
len ratingone No ad blockers No extensions Not as fast as safari
len ratingtwo I deleted chrome because I couldn t clear the search history anymore 
len ratingtwo An Apple tech said it was not possible anymore and that it was using data storage on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo I just googled how to clear it and got some instructions so I ll try chrome again and see if I can clear it 
len ratingtwo If not I ll delete it again 
len ratingtwo The tech said Duck Duck Go is a safe replacement for chrome and you can clear its history 
len ratingtwo But it didn t have as up to date information as chrome 
len ratingone No reason to have this update lost the ability to cast to chrome cast 
len ratingone Big waste of time and effort 
len ratingone Bring it back 
len ratingfive Shah pourman was very helpful And i like dealership Thanks shah i love my proud
len ratingone I used to love chrome but it s getting unusable on IOS because of the continual crashes 
len ratingone So unstable it s not even funny 
len ratingone Trying to read an article is just crash after crash 
len ratingone I had hoped it was just Google trying to shut down sites by deliberately crashing on them but it seems to do the same on virtually any blog these days 
len ratingone Maybe it s dying because of the ad overload it tries to push 
len ratingone But I do think they crash on sites they don t like content on deliberately I d give it a if I could

len ratingone Google fix your downloading problem
len ratingone It won t let me download
len ratingone App doesn t download at all after I uninstalled it
len ratingone Deleted it and now i am unable to redownload 
len ratingone Please fix
len ratingone Safari is better
len ratingfive Wife lives it
len ratingfour  Don t let this app run as a phone search engine instead make it run like a social media app because that would fix a lot of problems 
len ratingfive I love the new update 
len ratingfive I hated the old one like most people but with the new one it is so good looking and has good privacy 
len ratingfive I used to use edge in stead of chrome because it WAS bad but now it is amazing 
len ratingtwo  This is a bastardized version of chrome To save pages it s takes digging down two levels below WAY less useful commands BUT the clear all button is where it can be grabbed by accident and there is no confirmation needed to trash all you searches 
len ratingtwo And unlike the full version on desktops there is no restore function
len ratingone Every time you click the back button to go back to google search results it goes back to the top of the page 
len ratingone Super annoying 
len ratingthree Google is a good way to look things up but I have had some issues 
len ratingfive  I want a pc xD
len ratingfour What happened to scan the item picture that was located with the mic in the search bar 
len ratingfour I used this a lot 
len ratingfour Can t find it 
len ratingfive I hate this app Done and done eww don t get it
len ratingtwo It s very different and not in a good way very disappointed in the mix that up like most
len ratingfive  So far so good 
len ratingfive It has at least one thing to help me use the application properly 
len ratingone The app just won t work 
len ratingone It was just fine and for the last months it keeps crashing and won t bring the results 
len ratingone DL the app and it doesn t allow me to access my gmail 
len ratingtwo Every update to this app has made it worse 
len ratingthree Sometimes it will add about three of the same tabs
len ratingone Google is evil
len ratingone Says site can t be reached
len ratingfive Did d ethe is Eric day dftf ends ik ikmwhm Ma fr ff f Ok thx kkeep uoujiuk Ik I kkhjMI Ik K nomomo
len ratingfive Es buen servicio
len ratingfive  You guys are weird for rating google chrome
len ratingone Horrible app 
len ratingone Layout is awful
len ratingfive  SUB TO MY YOUTUBE DUBLETZ
len ratingone I just downloaded the app for my iPhone so I can visit one of my friends and the app won t even open or anything and keeps saying that I need to download it again
len ratingfour Not bad
len ratingone Google Translator doesn t work
len ratingone I even hate safari web browser
len ratingone it literally looks like safari 
len ratingone it s terrible
len ratingfive  Chrome is good but my suggestions are that if we want to exit a search we can actually exit instead of doing harder things to exit but I don t know how to exit so there 
len ratingfive I really like Chrome but it needs a little more like a more easy way to exit and if we are doing something like a research it needs more interesting more FUN facts instead of old facts 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive I hope ALL OF THE STUFF I SAID WILL BE IMPROVED 
len ratingone I basically can t even use Chrome anymore without it crashing and asking me to send feedback 
len ratingone  Switching back to Safari which is at least reliable 
len ratingone PDF functions don t work as well as they used too 
len ratingone In safari i can save to files 
len ratingone In Chrome the open in function doesn t work anymore
len ratingone Why not use safari this update is just trash if you are gonna update your game release a update that will bring people to your app not make people go to safari
len ratingfive Google chrome is a great way of surfing the web I really like it Michael
len ratingfour  Every time I remove the bookmark from my iPad my Google Chrome in my phone is still there 
len ratingfour I wonder what s going on with the syncing 
len ratingfour  Hey there 
len ratingfour Could you confirm you tried the instructions in the Fix problems with sync section of this help center article 
len ratingfour If you re still having issues with your bookmarks you are signed in to your Google account in Google
len ratingtwo While I think the app s functionality and speed is great chrome consistently drains or more of my battery in less than an hour 
len ratingtwo This occurs on an iPhone s with battery life remaining brightness turned down and for basic non streaming usage over WiFi 
len ratingtwo Would happily trade speed for longevity 
len ratingone I agree with the others who do not like the way you have diminished the value and use of google 
len ratingone I have deleted it from my phone and I am glad it is gone 
len ratingone It s a waste of my battery 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Everything you want in chrome but in a mobile version 
len ratingone Delivery is too late I wanted to start dahlias and begonias indoors I haven t received delivery yet may twelve 
len ratingone This puts my dahlias a month behind schedule and the begonias essentially a waste because the y won t be available to display until the summer is over The other perennial could have been planted two weeks ago 
len ratingone I m very Dissapointed I ordered early to get an early start and longer blooming season the late deliveries lost that for me
len ratingthree I usually have this same problem on any rd party web browser on iOS Chrome is slow and doesn t link to iOS when you ask Siri to search something on the web Siri will search on Safari 
len ratingthree Chrome is great and is my preferred browser on PC but Chrome doesn t work well on iOS 
len ratingthree I recommend just staying with Safari 
len ratingthree If not use the Google app it s faster

len ratingone Please help with anything else I can do I have downloaded the application and taken all the proper steps And then when I get back to the website it does the same thing again you are using an unsupported version please install but still nothing happens 
len ratingone What did you guys do with the app 
len ratingone It was great before but now it s just as bad as safari 
len ratingone Its uncomfortable counter intuitive and a total downgrade from what it was before 
len ratingone We should be able to revert back to the old version of chrome because no one wants to use this garbage
len ratingone Getting tired of being Kidnapped by ads ever other Day 
len ratingone Once the ad pops up I have to press ok to be able to use the app again and be diverted another site I or delete the app and download again 
len ratingone Had to do it twice today 
len ratingone This shouldn t be allowed 
len ratingone The offending ad today is marketwatchhome site 
len ratingfive It Is Great 
len ratingfive Don t Listen to any of the bad comments because this is nothing like safari at all 
len ratingfive It is easy to navigate and all you have to do to close a tab is tap the x in the corner 
len ratingfive I totally recommend this over Google Safari Fire Fox and any others like that 
len ratingfive This is a Great app to download and I totally recommend it 
len ratingone  Google I get that you wanna take over the world but your policies are ridiculous 
len ratingone I highly recommend to anyone reading this find another way to search the web because Google tracks every single thing about you 
len ratingone Down to the exact device you re using when you re using it and for how long 
len ratingone I for one am searching for different company to do business with in the future if Google is going to continue these utopian policies 
len ratingone This was my favorite browser now I totally hate this crap this is not user friendly nor convenient to anyone anyone who came up with this functionality clear thinking about themselves 
len ratingone THIS IS NOT USER FRIENDLY
len ratingfive  Using this for years just gets better and better
len ratingthree  Doesn t work auto translate 
len ratingthree All settings are good 
len ratingthree I think something wrong with website 
len ratingthree Please fix it

len ratingthree Please fix
len ratingone  I was at the bar with my friends and a lady took me home and but she told me she was a guy so I ran as fast as I could out of that house
len ratingtwo I loved Chrome before and now I can t stand the new layout 
len ratingtwo It s not user friendly or streamlined like it used to be 
len ratingtwo I agree with another reviewer if I took the time to download the app why would I want something just like Safari that is already on my phone 
len ratingtwo May just use safari unless Chrome gets better 
len ratingone Fix Find In Page 
len ratingone It doesn t work 
len ratingone At all

len ratingone Sent numerous feedback and no response from Google 
len ratingone I ll just switch back to Safari
len ratingone Before the last update this app was perfect 
len ratingone Now I have to find a new web browser 
len ratingone Please revert back to the previous version

len ratingone  YouTube has a dark UI option why not Chrome 
len ratingone I would update but if there s no dark UI that could help the eyes at night then no way 
len ratingone Every time I try to fullscreen a video the navigation bar does not go away and even blocks a portion of the video frame 
len ratingone Was this intentional or is it a bug 
len ratingone I have restarted the app my phone and uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the issue is not resolved 
len ratingfive I just started using chrome to help me out with my just starting YouTube channel I will have to say some features are a exact replica of safari but it still has some of its own features and I really like that about chrome it also helps me out with school homework 
len ratingfive Like I said before it helps me with my YouTube channel it lets me creat cute YouTube art to put on my account so it looks more aesthetically pleasing go subscribe to my YouTube channel my snap is unicorns tysm 
len ratingfour  I think google Chrome is the best when you compare it with the competition

len ratingone I loved Chrome before the update and no it s hard to use
len ratingone Love Chrome but since the new update after I attempt to search something through the search box I get a blank dark gray screen and it does nothing after that point 
len ratingone I even restarted my phone hoping it was that 
len ratingone Now I have to use Safari 
len ratingone  Shutter Please fix 
len ratingfour Bit of a battery drinker used to be more simple 
len ratingfour Connections with other Google products require other apps 
len ratingfour Overall smooth and attractive UI searches are speedy and efficient Editors Please introduce a dark mode 
len ratingone I reloaded Crome and this new version stinks
len ratingfive  I do like it how do you expect me to not the new design is perfect I love how you can do con flips get v bucks for free get robux for free all that stuff so I do like it but I DON T like that you have to prove your a human on some stuff robots can t even type on phones i m not a robot can the owner just change that or no 
len ratingfive Because I don t prove anything if I see that any where in google I m not using google for or weeks or or months but I give it a star it s so amazing thank god god made the owner of google but google now it for s but idc it s old but idc it s so amazing great app kids adults and grandparents use this likes aunts and grandpas an yea all that stuff but in my approval it s amazing I hope everybody likes this app I hope everybody has this app and gives it a stars awesome app 
len ratingthree Loooove the app 
len ratingthree Just started crashing on me all of the sudden please help 
len ratingtwo I do not want I order thru you I want my orders to go through Amazon and comcast
len ratingone I can t do nutthin
len ratingone I use incognito mode so I don t have to worry about cache and unnecessary junk 
len ratingone I had tabs open for convenience 
len ratingone Lost all tabs from an unexpected shutdown 
len ratingone Always happens once in a blue moon 
len ratingone This is the last straw 
len ratingone I will be transferring my bookmarks to Firefox and stop using Chrome 
len ratingone When I do a google search then click on the link and go to the searched for website I can t copy the link of the website to share with friends 
len ratingone The copied link is the google search 
len ratingone Tried to get around this with no success 
len ratingone I deleted the app 
len ratingone There s no use in having it if I can t share or copy and paste links 
len ratingfive This search engine is the only good engine fite me
len ratingone This place is one the worst hotels in the world they lied in every way possible the service is behind bad on every level please stay away is way too small to over price for the bad service you get honesty stay away also the don have an ocean view whatsoever plus is a very bad on every way
len ratingone Chrome needs a foundation for users and stop morphing 
len ratingfour Every thing is super easy to do with chrome and its much useful synchronized pages on different platforms 
len ratingfour The only thing missing is the ability to add shortcut to home screen on my iPhone 
len ratingfive I was told by a representative from DraftKings that I should use Google Chrome to post its App 
len ratingfive So how do I do that 
len ratingfive I already use yahoo to post my present DraftKings app 
len ratingone I ve been having problems with Chrome since December 
len ratingone I took my iphone to get checked with a tech and they were able to search using bing and yahoo but when on chrome or google com the search would stop and say err Internet Disconnected 
len ratingone On my Mac Chrome has a bug virus and no matter what I do I cannot remove it 
len ratingthree WAITING for a DARK MODE on iOS IF one is coming in iOS that s fine BUT what happened to Google Cloud Print 
len ratingfive Love this service 
len ratingfive So easy and convenient 
len ratingfive Employees very helpful and friendly 
len ratingfive Jealousy is always happy and represents Walmart very well 
len ratingone I recently switched my Mac desktop to Chrome and have been basically satisfied with it 
len ratingone It s simple but has everything I want 
len ratingone However the mobile app is pretty much useless because it s so limited 
len ratingone I just wish it would replicate the same look I have on my desktop 
len ratingone One would think that an outfit like Google could hire capable mobile app designers 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive Google crome
len ratingtwo  I don t recommend this app 
len ratingtwo Use safari instead 
len ratingone  Locks up on me several times a day 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingone Use to not have any problems but now on my iPhone X pages are loading halfway 
len ratingone If it does load it becomes unresponsive soon after 
len ratingone This is a knock off of a app it takes your space it s horrible 
len ratingone  After the recent update the app constantly locks up 
len ratingone Every other version of Chrome Windows macOS Android has the dark theme 
len ratingone Give us a clear advantage over Safari on iOS 
len ratingone Either the dark theme or extensions so we can use uBlock Origin but hopefully both 
len ratingone  Why does Chrome for Android resembles Chrome for desktop but Chrome for iOS doesn t 
len ratingone Terrible design so ugly and not intuitive 
len ratingone Since they released this new design I switched to Safari and I m waiting until they fix this mess 
len ratingfive Between google creative Commons and open source software I have found that it is very easy for anyone especially local law enforcement to digitally harass someone of course using networking throughCell phone providers this is how it s all possible
len ratingone  Be gone trackers
len ratingfive  J aime Google chrome
len ratingtwo Since the last update the sites don t render properly on the iPhone X 
len ratingtwo Sometimes only half the content shows up 
len ratingtwo It becomes unresponsive at times really 
len ratingtwo It is usually such a a reliable app 
len ratingtwo And not it s just not functional 
len ratingtwo Will have to use safari from now on 
len ratingfive  Candomening
len ratingone The recent redesign made at least two huge steps backwards It removes the ability to delete tabs by swiping them to the sides 
len ratingone  It moved the new tab button and put a close all tabs button that has no secondary confirmation dialog right where the new tab button used to be 
len ratingone The second issue is absolutely inexcusable I ve lost track of the number of times I ve gone to open a new tab and accidentally closed all my open tabs due to this horrible redesign 
len ratingtwo The new app is fairly easy to use for simple browsing opening new tabs and I like the read later feature 
len ratingtwo But in terms of saving PDFs or other files you find online the app is way too glitchy 
len ratingtwo Sometimes the menu options to save to files or send to Acrobat pop up sometimes they do not 
len ratingtwo Sometimes the options pop up but they don t actually work 
len ratingtwo I never have this issue with Safari or Firefox 
len ratingfive IMO the best browsing app
len ratingfive I accidentally deleted Google 
len ratingfive I want to get it back 
len ratingfive How can I get Google back
len ratingfive IT IS AMAZING I love the app
len ratingone  A few updates back the app was perfect running smoothly with updates that actually fixed problems 
len ratingone Suddenly there s a new interface and new issues popping up and random 
len ratingone The interface is clunky every link I click opens up in a new tab for some reason opening a new tab will often completely overnight an old tab pages don t even bother trying to load before error messages show up just overall it seems to have gotten worse 
len ratingfive This app is pretty fast for downloading My only advice is You need to get this to be able to download in the background using iOS device also a download folder Cause after downloading your file vanished in thin air And multi downloading options is needed More than that i love the app Great work 
len ratingone  The app crashed and my tabs are gone 
len ratingtwo I have used google chrome a lot recently I find it easier to use and such 
len ratingtwo But i am very mad because so many websites or things i look up can t be reached because the site is down but when i use my other browser i have no problems 
len ratingone  Darn
len ratingone I usually just use Firefox but it won t let me open something actually good like a link it it so now I m mad so I write this
len ratingone I have the latest update now nothings works 
len ratingfive  This is a great app it is very good 
len ratingone New design is very appalling 
len ratingone There is no need to emulate Safari s design what so ever 
len ratingone The new update is horrible 
len ratingone Every time you click on a result in the search it creates a new tab 
len ratingone It creates a new tab for everything 
len ratingone And there s no more pages results just one long endless scroll 
len ratingfive  It helps me with everything
len ratingfive  No duck duck go
len ratingfour Seems to be fine on pc so far
len ratingone I love Chrome for the desktop however the iOS version leaves much to be desired 
len ratingone There is no way to turn off recently visited sites from showing on the main screen and without extensions no way to adequately block ads 
len ratingone App freezes up and messes with my phone calls and everything and I m using an XR and nothing is wrong with it 
len ratingone chrome on mobile devices doesn t restore browsing sessions as well as it does on a desktop 
len ratingone i lost nearly tabs and they are basically irretrievable because there is no way to separate mobile browsing from desktop browsing in history 
len ratingone i ve come to peace with having lost them all thru digging i found about of them but it s still annoying 
len ratingfive I always have to many tabs open and chrome closes them for me if you don t want them to be closed don t close chrome 
len ratingfive People say it s flawed and became downgraded after the new update but I think it s great 
len ratingfive Chrome is simple fast and reliable and I will use this instead of safari from now on 
len ratingtwo  as title
len ratingone constantly freezing and crashing i can t even use it
len ratingone  Why did you charge me dollars today for 
len ratingtwo  The auto translate has been bugging out in the last update
len ratingtwo I went to Chrome for something different from google but the legit screen says google and I can t seem to find the difference 
len ratingtwo Now I m not complaining I m just saying why would you have two Google s 
len ratingfive Yuck
len ratingone  Hacker and stacker police report

len ratingone I have noticed several highjacking attempts through either safe websites or ISP charter 
len ratingone One locked Google chrome trying to force acceptance of a free gift 
len ratingone I shut down the page by stopping Google app from running 
len ratingone When I started the app again it came back 
len ratingone No matter what I did I could not get around it 
len ratingone The new design prevents me from deleting the physhing scam 
len ratingone Specific site that locked Google was SI com 
len ratingone The message started out as Hello Charter Communication 
len ratingone You qualify for a gift 
len ratingone Press OK to 
len ratingone I looked for a way to clear history in the Setting menus 
len ratingone Non found 
len ratingone So I deleted the app and am back on safari 
len ratingone This is horrible 
len ratingone It keeps lagging me out of my search and I hate the new design 
len ratingone It s like a Firefox mobile ripoff 
len ratingone Ugh
len ratingone We obviously liked that layout of the chrome browser so why would you update it to basically copy safari 
len ratingone I might as well use safari 
len ratingfive I personally love new UI animations are so smooth and chrome overall is fast 
len ratingone Crashes constantly especially if you have like tabs or more open at a time it will lose every single one when it crash and freezes while doing simple tasks 
len ratingone Would not recommend 
len ratingfive I love how it s like ur on a computer I know TRUST ME I read the reviews but IDFC I rlly like it
len ratingone  It automatically connects to converters now and doesn t let you search anything 
len ratingone DONT GET THIS 
len ratingfive When I find things that I don t know or just want entertainment I ll go to chrome right away 
len ratingone When i try to watch a video it keep lagging and over all this update is garbage
len ratingone Causes constant freezing on iPad and is sluggish and often unresponsive 
len ratingone Constantly Crashed usually gives you the restore button but after crash it didn t give me the option so now all my important are are gone 
len ratingone Don t update the app is very difficult to navigate and work 
len ratingone Definitely wouldn t recommend 
len ratingone Horrible design and hard to use 
len ratingone I started to download this app but thanks to the review I change my mind
len ratingone I try to read news articles that are listed on the search page but I get bombarded by pop up ads 
len ratingone You start reading a paragraph and it disappears while a new ad is loaded or you get ads coming in from the margins that block the text 
len ratingone I recently was trying to read a paragraph news article and had to quit after frustrating minutes of constant ads or having to reload the article 
len ratingone Chrome has me looking for an alternative browser 
len ratingone In the past everything else seemed worse 
len ratingone But this latest version has lowered the bar so far there has to be a worthwhile alternative 
len ratingone PS I ve read dozens of star reviews and when you consider the myriad of complaints seemingly all different their star rating sounds like google group think trying to bolster their sub par performance 
len ratingone When I download the newest version it opens FaceBook 
len ratingone Go figure 
len ratingfive When I walked into the establishment it was very clean and welcoming 
len ratingfive From the manager to the employees my service was amazing 
len ratingfive Everything was accomplished and in a timely manner 
len ratingfive I will recommend anyone to go see Chris and his amazing team 
len ratingfive urysyzwynowyyi
len ratingone I hate this app also 
len ratingtwo More recently I ve noticed that when I talk about something I think this browser listens to key words 
len ratingtwo I ve tested it where I turn off the mic and then turn it on 
len ratingtwo When the mic is on in settings I notice I get ads in different apps tailored to what I ve said recently 
len ratingtwo Seems like other apps Instagram for example mic is turned off on those apps are pulling from Chrome 
len ratingtwo Kind of creepy just wish they would explicitly tell us 
len ratingtwo Also not really liking the way different windows are shown 
len ratingtwo It s much more tedious to close the app when they are laid out like cards 
len ratingtwo Sticking with Safari now 
len ratingone The new version for iPhonescis not friendly at all
len ratingthree Please add the password feature that safari has where you can auto fill from iOS keychain that s a really useful feature that I need 
len ratingthree Also please add extension like Adblock or etc 
len ratingfive Would love to see a dark mode for IOS
len ratingfive Muchas gracias A Brandy Leyva por su gran ayuda en la compra de mi carro 
len ratingfive Yo la recomiendo ampliamente en la proxima compra de su auto 
len ratingfive Great app love the Dino game when u have no WiFi or connection lol
len ratingone Put the bookmark star back in the address bar 
len ratingfive  I have not tried this yet well all these comments are making me want to delete this
len ratingone I cannot stand the new app 
len ratingone It used to be so easy to use 
len ratingone Now you have to open another window to see all the open windows 
len ratingone It takes longer for pages to load 
len ratingone The new layout is an eyesore 
len ratingone I m uninstalling it and moving to afari 
len ratingfive I need this app downloaded and closed From Terri Cobb
len ratingone The app use to e good now itSucks and Google Suckstoo
len ratingfive Google chrome mobile browser is sleek and intuitive 
len ratingfive I love the integration of my google account and google chrome browsers across multiple devices 
len ratingfive It s fast and so far seems more reliable than the previous non Safari browser I was using on mobile 
len ratingfive Wish I switched sooner 
len ratingone So I can t put any PDFs into my note taking app 
len ratingtwo W texasazv yvc 
len ratingtwo  zem w you Elm wtz d
len ratingone Downloaded specifically to use the sketchup app 
len ratingone Refuses to work one error after another 
len ratingone Delete 
len ratingone Once again all tabs are gone after app crashed 
len ratingone They are in history but have to load them one by one 
len ratingone Time to look for new browser app 
len ratingone Darn Google 
len ratingone  This is the largest source of knowledge learning and incoming information 
len ratingone We trust Google to give us honest and real answers but they re not 
len ratingone They are purposefully throttling relevant information and searched for information in favor of their communistic views that they would like to push on to the public 
len ratingone This is a dishonest and disingenuous company 
len ratingone They have every right to be that seeing as they are their own company But this is still the free market system and in a free market system companies that practiced dishonest and disingenuous business practices will always lose their shares eventually 
len ratingone Google is just praying that the communists take over first so that they can subsidize their failing company 
len ratingtwo Fast browser but fast energy consommation
len ratingfive Never had any problems with this app 
len ratingfive CHROME IS AWESOME IDC what people think FIRST it s a lot faster than safari ND U CAN CONNECT IT TO UR GOOGLE ACCOUNT FOR WORK RD U CAN CHECK UR MAIL WITHOUT ANY SLOWNESS 
len ratingfive Download this app it s a gift from God
len ratingfive  Thanks
len ratingfive  Much faster than Safari 
len ratingfive I received it on time in perfect condition 
len ratingfive I love it better than safari
len ratingtwo The close all button is too easy to hit on accident 
len ratingtwo I have lost all my tabs and will have to go through the torturous process of finding all the pages again 
len ratingone I can t sign in for a week because of their security picture matching keeps popping up and up 
len ratingone For a solid week 
len ratingone This is after I m already linking from the email they already sent to my email 
len ratingone So I m already verified 
len ratingfive Pewdiepie pewdiepie ROCKS 
len ratingfour So lately the Mac version on google chrome has been crashing a lot 
len ratingfour Like I mean A LOT 
len ratingfour It s a problem and I d like it to be fixed
len ratingthree  I went to open the browser and it closed out immediately 
len ratingthree I decided to turn my phone off and on again to see if it made a difference 
len ratingthree It still closed out on me so I figured the next logical thing to to was delete the app and reinstall it 
len ratingthree Once I deleted it I went to the App Store to reinstall and for some reason my phone still thought I had chrome installed because instead of an install button the open button came up 
len ratingthree So I clicked on it and it still closed me out 
len ratingthree Also no matter how many times I delete the app it ll still show up in my apps and every time I click on it it still closes me out 
len ratingthree Any idea what might be going on 
len ratingthree I d love to have that app working on my phone again but can t see that happening anywhere in the near future unless I can talk to someone directly about this 
len ratingfive It was a pleasure to do business with All State Gutter 
len ratingfive David came for estimate followed through 
len ratingfive Provided a competitive quote 
len ratingfive Fixed the price and scope 
len ratingfive Came exactly as promised 
len ratingfive Completed all services on time as promised 
len ratingfive Others should follow them 
len ratingone The voice to search does not work in chrome or google assistant 
len ratingone On iOS for iPad A 
len ratingfive This condo was lovely 
len ratingfive The decor was so carefully done many personal touches that made it so fun to come back to after a day of walking golfing or beach time 
len ratingfive T he location is so convenient to everything that makes Amelia Island special 
len ratingfive We will definitely be back and will stay at this particular condo 
len ratingfive The owner is terrific 
len ratingone This app is by far the less superior web browser when compared to Safari 
len ratingone I have given Google Chrome multiple chances to redeem themselves but they consistently come up short 
len ratingone Ex no compatibility with enlarging video screen Furthermore the internet connection is horrid 
len ratingone Multiple times while searching for internet Chrome failed to produce results while Safari come through in a timely manner 
len ratingone I don t know why anyone would choose this hot garbage over safari 
len ratingfive I have an iPhone and used safari these past couple years 
len ratingfive Got tired of it and just started using Chrome 
len ratingfive It s cute fun and FASTER 
len ratingfive A good deal faster so thank you 
len ratingone The sole reason I keep Chrome around is to sync bookmarks from my Google account 
len ratingone Otherwise it s rather sluggish compared to Safari 
len ratingone I don t like the redesign either it now looks more like Safari 
len ratingone The main reason I installed this app in the first place is so that I don t have to use Safari 
len ratingone New design is horrible 
len ratingone Users shuld have options
len ratingfive Easily the best browser 
len ratingfive More options to navigate google and easier to save pics 
len ratingfive Wish iPhone would allow to save videos like with android phones just let us use this browser as a default
len ratingone The update ruined this app bye Felicia
len ratingfive  It s cool
len ratingfour This Chrome already needs an update 
len ratingfour Cannot sign in to a few websites as it states the Chrome browser as being obsolete 
len ratingone The new design is garbage 
len ratingone The whole reason I use Chrome was to have a simple yet easy to use and good functionality design 
len ratingone Now it s no different than Safari and it s awful 
len ratingone I accidentally updated the app and now I wish I didn t 
len ratingfive The google chrome did not open I tried and didn t open the browser didn t even work I Need help please 
len ratingone It directs you to mobile pages the option to switch to desktop version of the website just reloads the mobile one 
len ratingthree Whenever I go on sites pop up scams like the Facebook rewards scam keep popping up far too many times 
len ratingthree The pop up blocker doesn t do it s job at stopping that 
len ratingthree Good app otherwise 
len ratingone used to work great as an everyday browser as of thursday last week Android messages has not worked 
len ratingone It s been a few days with no fix so far 
len ratingone Safari and other off brand browsers work fine 
len ratingone Come on google if you want to compete with IOS IMessage you have to step up your game 
len ratingone Takes forever to load and only loads half pics 
len ratingfive  Thanks
len ratingone  Google is obviously intentionally degrading the application to a state of unusability seemingly in an effort to move people from the iOS platform 
len ratingone The latest version does not resemble a browser whatsoever

len ratingone  Spies on me like crazy 
len ratingone A whole bunch of malware 
len ratingone I hate google because it wants to hack you and it s always looking for ways to hack any users 
len ratingone That s why I switched to Brave it s like a chrome but that s not taken over by the Chinese and that blocks all spyware 
len ratingone It doesn t do what I want it to do because it spied on me and it s always asking me to access my location which is just begging me for all my information and you know what google wants to do with that information right 
len ratingone That s why I just use brave and if a site doesn t work I just just occasionally turn off private browsing mode Incognito mode is really just being anonymous BUT google can always tell a spy who you are and then when I m done with that site I go back on to private browsing mode 
len ratingfive Muito bom adorei
len ratingone  Spies on me like crazy 
len ratingone A whole bunch of malware 
len ratingone I hate google because it wants to hack you and it s always looking for ways to hack any users 
len ratingone That s why I switched to Brave it s like a chrome but that s not taken over by the Chinese and that blocks all spyware 
len ratingthree There seems to be a small ad that keeps popping up at the bottom of the browser 
len ratingthree Even when I closed it it will appear on a new web page 
len ratingthree In a small phone screen it got too irritating 
len ratingthree I finally removed the ad 
len ratingthree When an app takes over my control on my own phone then it is time to find alternative app 
len ratingone Google always falls short of what they try to project they re never transparent 
len ratingone This is usually my go to browser but my biggest gripe is the app s susceptibility to malicious pop ups that cannot be closed and they are impossible to get rid of since Crome remembers the last website you are on and reopens the app on the malicious redirect site 
len ratingone Please provide an option that says do you want to restore open r tabs 
len ratingone or at least some way to click out of a tab so I don t have to delete the app every time I get stuck in one of these malicious pop up loops 
len ratingone It is maddening 
len ratingfive Chrome is very good
len ratingfour This is a very helpful app You can basically do whatever I like that you have other apps You can get almost anything you need and want on here 
len ratingfour It does have its down sides though The new version isn t the best and I don t like that it says that you need to be because it s a little unnecessary They should at least make it 
len ratingfour Other than that everything is perfect 
len ratingfour I do recommend this app 
len ratingfive I am looking for something to replace safari Google Chrome is 
len ratingfive I am love the new version Google Chrome is my favorite one to the top my phone works well for my iPad please thank you for making the same story to me I love the fact you have some good things thanks for good service please thank the developer for the good work update good luck
len ratingone  I have to pick my shifts for work on Chrome 
len ratingone Now when I go to the app it says download app which I push on which brings me to an open app button which doesn t do anything 
len ratingone I have missed being able to pick up any shifts my job has texted 
len ratingone VERY annoyed 
len ratingone Now I have to take a two hour bus ride both ways to go to my job and figure out what s wrong and I have missed over a weeks pay 
len ratingone There have been more than times that I ve accidentally pushed Close All Tabs 
len ratingone Either add a confirmation window Are you sure you would like to close x number of tabs or put it in the menu 
len ratingone Just anything but in the upper left hand corner of the tabs view 
len ratingone Since the update the app shows up like a desktop site 
len ratingone It is too small zoomed out and not user friendly 
len ratingone Please fix go back to how it was 
len ratingone I don t want to have to start using Safari 
len ratingone This new update looks horrible the old UI was better 
len ratingone Please refine the old look and try and work off it 
len ratingone Because the new one is bad 
len ratingfive  I don t know what s wrong I love the chrome app it s helpful with many things
len ratingone gmail app has very limited functionality while i was using inbox app for my security cameras email notifications it suddenly removed off from appstore now i am seeking to completely move from google and switch to alternatives disrespected disgusted and disappointed this my google user experience 
len ratingfour  This is a very good app You can search whatever is necessary you can get on websites and whatch whatever and when ever And I think it s a pretty good app You can get to almost anything on there without having to download the other app 
len ratingfour I don t like that it says that it s because you don t need to be that old I think they should fix it to be at least But other then that I think it s a great app I highly recommend it to everyone 
len ratingfive After this update 
len ratingfive Everything is awesome 
len ratingone Please please give an option to use Plan A This is just so crazy making I can t even spit 
len ratingone I used to love using chrome but now it feels exactly like safari If that s what I wanted I wouldn t have downloaded Google
len ratingone It is absolutely disgusting
len ratingone  People will find out we re I live
len ratingtwo  Syncing tabs between iPhone iPad and PC don t seem to be working anymore 
len ratingtwo I m signed in and I ve selected the Sync Everything option but with no luck 
len ratingtwo I recently purchased a XS Max and have also lost all of my open tabs twice within a couple months 
len ratingone  It doesn t show the option to open bookmarks in the Netlfix app 
len ratingone Chrome was great before it s User Interface UI was completely ruined by a recent update 
len ratingone Videos also are loading improperly now too 
len ratingone  star
len ratingone  Please have the pop up blocker work I get constant ads and it s quite annoying also chrome now all drains of my battery and that s not good at all please improve
len ratingone The Open In option is complete garbage 
len ratingone Everytime I download to save a pdf or ppt from blackboard it never opens the documents in external apps let alone any type of pdf or anything into other apps 
len ratingone Everytime I press open in it literally does nothing 
len ratingone Have to switch browsers and do the sign in process every time I try to get documents in general since I forget Chrome has that buggy export feature 
len ratingone And the little box above that says export only exports direct links and not documents mostly useless since blackboard and other sites requiere direct logins 
len ratingone When this feature gets fixed I ll instantly upgrade this review to stars without any issue 
len ratingone Thanks for your attention 
len ratingfour I rated stars cause it said bad words and my mom got mad so I deleted a long time ago then the update youtube cant change our profile delete this 
len ratingone In the beginning we were attracted to the simplicity and accurate results 
len ratingone The lack of clutter and ads supported what was once the best search engine 
len ratingone Results are now doctored and skewed with advertisements disguised as links to search results 
len ratingone Google curates content that conforms to a bias popularity 
len ratingone This application is anti Free Speech and corrupts communities around the world 
len ratingthree While I love chrome for PC despite it being a memory hog I expected so much from the iOS app and it just couldn t deliver 
len ratingthree I find that it is too slow compared to safari 
len ratingthree I enjoy being able to pick up where I left off on my computer but IT DOESN T DUPLICATE TABS 
len ratingthree All I really wanted from chrome on iOS was speed interface not internet wise the ability to pick up where I left off on my pc and ability to DUPLICATE TABS 
len ratingthree Seeing as how it failed to meet two of my requirements I won t continue using it 
len ratingthree I don t see why I should simply settle for Chrome s mediocracy on iOS 
len ratingfour  This app is great 
len ratingfour This is my go to browser 
len ratingfour It loads website fast 
len ratingfour I have this browser installed on my iPhone iPad and my MacBook Pro 
len ratingfour The one problem I have with this app is that there is no ad blocker in the settings that blocks all ads on all websites 
len ratingfour Just a pop up blocker in settings that works ok but not good enough 
len ratingone With iOS allowing content blocking in Safari and just about every other rd party browser offering ad blocking of some type the fact Chrome has no way to block ads puts this browser in an antiquated last place of available browsers on iOS 
len ratingfive Wirks perfectly
len ratingone  I would way rather use Google thanks to the update 
len ratingone Before You could easily find past tabs easily search and so on 
len ratingone It was perfect until the update 
len ratingone The update just made it worse 
len ratingone It might just be my internet but why is the screen blank 
len ratingone At least add a place where you can just touch to type rather then adding a big bar at the bottom just to take up space 
len ratingone And it just looks like a copy of Safari like many people said 
len ratingone Many of your users switched because they did not like the look of Safari so why did you make a copy of it 
len ratingone And you think this is better than Google 
len ratingone No way 
len ratingone Way rather use Google 
len ratingfour  I love this app it really easy to navigate the WiFi with it
len ratingthree There are pirates that take you away from Chrome and put you into a site called goodluckday site with a screen that says Congratulations iPhone user 
len ratingthree You have been randomly selected to a spin and get unclaimed reward 
len ratingthree Click OK to start 
len ratingthree I won t touch it 
len ratingthree It looks like a scam 
len ratingthree And it has captured me quite a few times 
len ratingthree The problem is that when their screen shows up and I ve been transported to good luck day site I can t get Google back until I delete it and reinstall Google 
len ratingthree Then Google asks me for my password 
len ratingthree I don t think I ever had a password 
len ratingthree I ve never been asked to use one except after I ve been kidnapped and then try to reinstall Google 
len ratingthree Can you do something about these guys who take Google customers away and put them into their site 
len ratingthree Or are you powerless over them 
len ratingfive Good job
len ratingthree Incognito 
len ratingfive I like 
len ratingfive It good for me search in 
len ratingthree The latest update enlarged the Open Tab tiles and I now have to scroll repeatedly if i have multiple tabs open 
len ratingthree Please provide the ability to make tiles smaller again 
len ratingfive The title is my review
len ratingone You copy cat copy puffin when you reload and scroll up you can reload it but that s puffins 
len ratingone You guys are going to get sued by puffin if you don t stop and I hope they do not cool guys just not cool chrome more like copyright chrome not cool just not cool 
len ratingone Finally decided not to share my internet browsing data with Google anymore and switched to safari 
len ratingtwo Listen I know I m behind the times but I rarely update my apps 
len ratingtwo I JUST got the design update and what 
len ratingtwo I m sorry but I use Google chrome because it s NOTHING like Safari 
len ratingtwo Never once have I thought wow I wish Google chrome were more like Safari 
len ratingtwo never has ANY PERSON EVER thought that 
len ratingtwo So why am I suddenly looking at a copy of Safari with Chrome splashed on it 
len ratingtwo I love chrome but this redesign is a complete disappointment 
len ratingthree It s a great browser it syncs my passwords and favorite websites 
len ratingthree the problem is that it does not have a blocker of advertisements and this becomes annoying 
len ratingfive Fast and well optimized 
len ratingfive Syncs with all your devices 
len ratingfive Can have like tabs open at a time on an iPhone SE with no extra lag 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingone  If it ain t broke don t fix it Because of the latest update I can no longer access my bank account 
len ratingone This is crap 
len ratingone I am going to check out Microsoft s latest browser 
len ratingone I think that my next phone will be an IPhone no more Google Android O S s for me 
len ratingone Have to type and submit searches twice for page to submit and load criteria 
len ratingone Also there is issue with placing the curser 
len ratingone I m going to try to uninstall and and reinstall 
len ratingone Otherwise I ll just use google search bar through Safari and see if that fixes it 
len ratingone I have been a chrome mobile user for a very long time on iOS 
len ratingone The recent redesign for the chrome app is not really that great because a lot of the new user interface is now awkward 
len ratingone For example in the new redesign there is both a top and bottom bar which doesn t expand on the functionality of the app at all and takes up a lot of space 
len ratingone Additionally one can t swipe to close a tab and instead have to click on the x button 
len ratingone Because of changes such as these chrome feels a lot more sluggish 
len ratingone Users should be given the option of reverting to the old design such as through chrome flags 
len ratingtwo Every time I try to type something the search bar goes up and I can t tell what I m typing aside from looking down at my keyboard 
len ratingtwo Also when you enter a new search it goes back to your previous one 
len ratingtwo I m not really liking this update at all 
len ratingfive I rate it five star because this app is a very important app for your everyday life Without it I m sure that y all people wouldn t be able to search information Find your destinations and find things that you re curious about Y all people that don t appreciate amazing people that created this app then create something you think is useful for your self I truly love it and I hope in the future people will love it 
len ratingone I m so blown I been using this app since iPhone and I never had a problem I updated and restarted my phone same problem I end up deleting and reinstalling the app but nothing changed 
len ratingone Smh
len ratingone You no longer respect meta name viewport content width device width initial scale viewport fit cover Fix this 
len ratingfour Loved the dog
len ratingfive  It is better in my opinion than safari
len ratingone get ur act together 
len ratingone this app was good now its trash 
len ratingone CANT MAKE VIDEO WORK WHEN BROADCASTING TO APPLE TV 
len ratingone app is missing core functionality 
len ratingone this is atrocious and infuriating 
len ratingone if your updates gunna break the app how about you DONT UPDATE 
len ratingone you just lost all the reputation this app used to have 
len ratingone congratulations dilweeds 
len ratingone Now the app cant even post to facebook 
len ratingone Keep getting worse or dont fix it and its getting deleted very soon
len ratingfive I only download crome so that I can watch p rn because safari is stupid and won t let me use the search bar
len ratingthree  The hold to finely place cursor does not work in the search Omni bar on the iPhone se a somewhat important feature 
len ratingthree Have to manually clear and retype if I want to alter query 
len ratingthree Will update to stars when fixed 
len ratingtwo I use the chrome as my default browser on all my devices and find it to be working quite nicely 
len ratingtwo But when using it with my Ipad Pro with the Folio Keyboard I ve noticed a simple but easy to solve bug or maybe not a bug but a very very disturbing one 
len ratingtwo When I press the or the CMD T combo and create a new tab I CAN T INPUT THE ADDRESS RIGHT AWAY as on the desktop version 
len ratingtwo Why is that so 
len ratingtwo The app has to know that i ve got my keyboard enabled attached 
len ratingtwo I really pisses me off every single time 
len ratingtwo Please GOOGLE SOLVE THIS 
len ratingone  What good does it do to have a Pop up Blocker in the browser if it doesn t block ANY pop ups 
len ratingone I ve tried turning it off and going to a page then turning it on and going back to the same page and the exact same ads pop up both times on every single page I ve gone to 
len ratingone Constantly causes page error reloads unreadable web pages and slow loads 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone The new design looks bad and is confusing 
len ratingone There was nothing wrong with the old design 
len ratingone Please give us an option to choose how the app looks 
len ratingfive Bruh
len ratingfive I literally JUST downloaded this app and was blown away by the intuitive interface 
len ratingfive I can remove useless applications witch vvill allow me to record videos and take photos without having to compromise on memory 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive Blanca
len ratingthree Can t see previews on tabs now 
len ratingthree Color seems almost black white at times 
len ratingthree Bookmarks not the same 
len ratingfive The title says it
len ratingone  BREAK THEM UP 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT 
len ratingone I ve been using chrome for several months now and I ve had maybe or tabs open for me to go back to the page later 
len ratingone Well turns out chrome deleted all the pages I had open even in incognito mode 
len ratingone Now I will not remember those pages 
len ratingone Thanks guys 
len ratingone Whatever ugh I hate this place now 
len ratingone Going with aloha 
len ratingone Browser 
len ratingfive Looks like they fixed the typing issue
len ratingfive Idk I just watch pornhub on here
len ratingone I am not a fan of google chrome 
len ratingone I have to take more steps to look up things such as local restaurants 
len ratingone I can t clear my history as easily which you need to be able to do in order to use this app 
len ratingone I looked up an income tax question found my site for the answer the multiple porn sites popped up 
len ratingone It took clearing my browser times to get them to go away 
len ratingone Is google chrome sponsored by porn 
len ratingone  Crashes every time you use it without exception 
len ratingfive  So convenient
len ratingone Updates are confusing 
len ratingone What was monkeyed with 
len ratingone What was supposed to be better than before 
len ratingone Google COULD just send an informative email to tell users what changed and how the change is better 
len ratingone Find Chrome MORE difficult and confusing AFTER the update 
len ratingone Google seems to forget that NOT ALL USERS ARE TECHNOGOOKS 
len ratingone I avoid Google Chrome now at all costs 
len ratingone I connect to where I want to be via Safari 
len ratingthree  Im not able to get to certain sites 
len ratingthree It says download google chrome when Im actually using google chrome 
len ratingthree So I switch to Safari and get the same issue 
len ratingthree Look guys fix this fast please 
len ratingone App needs a major update 
len ratingone I have a iPhone X and it runs slow on almost every site and becomes unusable 
len ratingone Even froze my phone a few times 
len ratingone No other app does this
len ratingone Gargantuan cluster f 
len ratingone Got so big so fast and forgot to listen to the customers who made them this big 
len ratingone For months now Chrome app on phone crashes if there s any long article 
len ratingone My solution copy the link to Safari 
len ratingone And wallah it works 
len ratingone I deleted app cleared cache and did all the recommended steps that a bit told me 
len ratingone But still 
len ratingone I see where this is going 
len ratingone Downfall is not far 
len ratingone When you stop listening to your customers you are preparing for day bezos 
len ratingone Unlike YouTube chrome has alternative 
len ratingone Take that 
len ratingone Keep staying in your lala land and continue to create distance from your customers by NOT LISTENING 
len ratingone I can assure you the results 
len ratingone Doesn t support good extension
len ratingone Crash crash crash and crash some more 
len ratingone Oh and have some zero days too 
len ratingthree Kinda boring it works doe
len ratingone Switching to Safari until you fix your last update 
len ratingtwo Used to be a great product until it somehow uses up more RAM and slows down the experience even to typing at the search bar
len ratingthree That previous update that reformatted the interface was fine but the most recent update that claimed to fix bugs did the opposite now the keyboard is SUPER laggy and essentially unusable I ve moved back to safari and I despise safari because of how bad it is 
len ratingthree Also what happened to autocomplete for queries 
len ratingthree Only things I ve previously searched show up when I m typing something 
len ratingthree Why does this app even exist if it doesn t do what it s supposed to 
len ratingthree I know you can do better google 
len ratingthree I m not mad just disappointed
len ratingtwo Only app I m experiencing an enormous keyboard lag Chrome 
len ratingtwo Ever since the last update 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo It drives me insane 
len ratingfive I deleted the app and redownloaded it and I believe the lag is gone 
len ratingone Then this is the app for you 
len ratingone On way too many occasions Chrome just decides delete every single tab including quite a few fairly important ones and then wipes my history so I can t even recover them 
len ratingone It ll delete tabs that I had opened two minutes ago 
len ratingone Great app 
len ratingtwo  Very laggy for the letters to show up when typing 
len ratingtwo In recent months my open webpages tabs have been lost closed 
len ratingtwo I am disappointed that there does not seem to be a way to restore the pages after the initial prompt is closed 
len ratingtwo It would be helpful to have a restore last session option permanently 
len ratingtwo Additionally it would be helpful to open more than one webpage from the history with out it closing and then having to reopen the history to open another 
len ratingtwo Recent issues have made me want to change browsers 
len ratingfour I use this app over my actual safari app on both my iPhone and iPad 
len ratingfour It s great and tends to load sites faster than safari 
len ratingfour The only issue is that sometimes there isn t the integration with different apps so if you open a link from an app it will open it in safari not Chrome 
len ratingfour Otherwise it s a great app 
len ratingfive This new update is lightning fast 
len ratingfive So far no lag none of the crashes that happened all to often the UI design is slick and elegant 
len ratingfive I like it a lot so far although I ve only used it for a couple of minutes 
len ratingfive Me encanta
len ratingtwo For the past week or two typing in the omnibar has had horrible lag with the default iOS keyboard 
len ratingtwo Pretty disappointing that not only was this able to make it through QA to release but that a fix still hasn t been issued despite many similar recent reviews 
len ratingfive Best Pharmacy team I have delt with 
len ratingfive Their always helpful and easy to work with 
len ratingfive I m on and need help 
len ratingfive Their always eager to assist and I have a lot of meds to coordinate with 
len ratingone This past month has ruined it for me for all things Google 
len ratingone The lag on this latest update is absolutely soul crushing 
len ratingone And the Gmail update is absolutely annoying and not even remotely intuitive especially when bouncing from one email account to another 
len ratingone What are you guys doing 
len ratingtwo It shouldn t take for ever for the letters to show when typing 
len ratingone  This had a cast creek bottom option on the top menu now after update it s gone 
len ratingone  bring it back immediately and io gibe stars again now we have to use other apps to cast the screen all the top apps have a cast screen button 
len ratingfour A setting for reader view would be great 
len ratingtwo  Great but it needs shockwave flash support 
len ratingthree I use several important Chrome apps with the Chrome on my desktop but they won t work on the iPad making Chrome not nearly as useful as it is on the desktop 
len ratingone All of these things are not showing in Chrome for iOS 
len ratingone I have made sure I m signed in and sync turned on on each device and computer and still nothing
len ratingfive Stop complaining
len ratingone Autocomplete locks up keyboard inputs
len ratingone The latest chrome update is absolutely broken when typing in the URL search bar googles predictive text algorithm lags the app SO much that text input is lagging behind as much as ms 
len ratingone Completely unusable 
len ratingone It s pathetic that a company the size of google can t even fix an issue that script kiddies could fix in minutes 
len ratingfive I it 
len ratingone  This app is now painfully slow and has a hard time doing anything that it is intended to do 
len ratingone So much keyboard lag and half of the time that I search something it just takes me to a white page
len ratingtwo Search bar has painfully slow lag 
len ratingtwo Needs to be fixed 
len ratingthree  Idk
len ratingone New version is absolutely horrible I lost all the tabs i had open and my google account stopped working 
len ratingone So I moved to apple and it is so much nicer and safari is also so nice apple is running very smooth
len ratingfive Can you do this off line
len ratingone This was my go to browser 
len ratingone It wasn t anything remarkably better than safari but I liked that you could ask google a question and incognito mode 
len ratingone But the keyboard issue is not only annoying it makes it harder to search and surf the web 
len ratingone Needs to be fixed soon 
len ratingone For now the app has been deleted from my phone and I m back to Safari 
len ratingtwo This latest update introduced a bug where typing anything into the search URL omnibox is painfully slow the keyboard lags and stutters as you try to type 
len ratingtwo This makes Chrome almost unusable for me 
len ratingtwo Back to Safari until they release an update that resolves this 
len ratingtwo Keyboard lags out after new update 
len ratingtwo Not cool man
len ratingone The keyboard has extremely slow lag 
len ratingone It is unusable 
len ratingone I have to go back to using Safari until it is fixed please fix it soon it s sooooo slow 
len ratingfive  Google is awesome I have a bunch of google homes and I love what this company sells 
len ratingfive Such amazement 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone I have been using this app for a long time and now out of nowhere there is keyboard lag 
len ratingone Only app that does this 
len ratingone When typing anything into the url search bar chrome lags between every letter now 
len ratingone Updated to iOS when it started so I thought I had to update chrome but the latest update for chrome didn t fix it either 
len ratingtwo I want to select my own shortcuts that show up on the Google homepage 
len ratingtwo Chrome keeps changing them randomly 
len ratingtwo The site that I go to most often will have a shortcut there one day and then not the next 
len ratingtwo Stop trying to be intuitive and using whatever algorithms you use 
len ratingtwo Just let me decide what shortcuts to place there 
len ratingthree Misspelled on your app
len ratingtwo  The latest update is laggy and I have difficulty searching and writing URL s 
len ratingtwo Browser keeps getting hijacked with no way to close the popup
len ratingone I ve been using the Chrome app for years but this last update has made it unusable 
len ratingone With the lag in the keyboard and delay lack of search suggestions I will be using the stock Safari app until fixed 
len ratingone Extremely poor keyboard response 
len ratingone Type a letter and it takes a second to realize 
len ratingone Only app on my phone that does this 
len ratingone  Typing in the search bar now is ridiculously slow in the newest update can t even use the app anymore
len ratingone  Can we please fire the morons who keep screwing up what was one the best browser on iOS 
len ratingone What moron took a page out of the Fisher Price school of web design with the latest UI 
len ratingone Complete garbage and a waste of human space went into this crap 
len ratingone  Why won t it open up in the App Store 
len ratingone Long time chrome user here 
len ratingone In this latest update the first time I type in a search nothing happens 
len ratingone It navigates away to a white page stays there for seconds and then navigates back 
len ratingone Sometimes it stays stuck there 
len ratingone This should have been caught in basic testing 
len ratingone On an iPhone each minute you browse uses of battery 
len ratingone Login with google feels really unsafe and shouldn t auto pop up on all websites
len ratingtwo In short Just get Firefox 
len ratingtwo In Long I ve been wanting to get away from googles environment for sometime but didn t like the interface of other apps 
len ratingtwo I tried safari that endeavor lasted for all of minutes and then I tried Firefox it was Okay I wasn t a huge fan of the UI and it would take some time to adjust 
len ratingtwo I was left with chrome until I could finally work up the endurance to get migrate over to Firefox but the UI just kept pushing me away 
len ratingtwo So I guess I was just stuck with chrome 
len ratingtwo I finally decided to update iOS on my phone and to go with it I figured I d update my frequently used apps immediately following the update 
len ratingtwo While anticipating a few more apps breaking outright or mildly falling apart with the updates I was surprised to find the UI of my unfortunate chrome app almost exactly matched the Firefox interface 
len ratingtwo Well chrome you ve single handedly pushed me out of the google environment take care 
len ratingtwo After latest updates lag while typing in app is horrendous to the point of unusable 
len ratingtwo No other app on my phone is having these input problems 
len ratingone The last update pretty much wrecked the UI 
len ratingone This browser is crap now 
len ratingone Stick to Firefox 
len ratingfour Enjoying the new look in the update thanks Google
len ratingthree Fix the search engine it s horrible now after the recent update 
len ratingone The latest update made Chrome so slow and laggy it is essentially completely unusable 
len ratingone The good news is their new update made Chrome look so much like Safari maybe I won t notice the difference when I switch 
len ratingone There s a blocking UI delay when typing into the url search bar 
len ratingone All other inputs are just fine 
len ratingone Only the search bar lags 
len ratingone I m running an iPhone X 
len ratingone This has always been my favorite browser but the last few updates have no improved the app 
len ratingone The latest update has caused the keyboard to be so laggy that it is unusable 
len ratingone Also my search suggestions stopped showing up from Google 
len ratingone Another recent update changed the layout to match Safari 
len ratingone I used to love to swipe through all of my open tabs amp close the ones I needed to close quickly amp easily 
len ratingone Now the app goes to the tiled screen where you see several tiny versions of each page 
len ratingone I have to click on each one to even tell what many of them are amp most of the time that page has to reload amp many times fails doing that 
len ratingone It takes about x as long to go through amp close tabs 
len ratingone Super annoying 
len ratingone Bring back the old way 
len ratingone  But first fix the laggy keyboard because I can t even use Chrome at this point 
len ratingone  You can Watch porn Thanks
len ratingone Everything about this new chrome is so slow I wish I never updated 
len ratingone Going to different browser now
len ratingone There are dozens of browsers 
len ratingone If they won t make it easy I ll use another one 
len ratingone I d suggest duckduckgo 
len ratingtwo  So I have a few suggestions for making the software better hope it could help 
len ratingtwo First I m not a fan of the chrome gestures 
len ratingtwo Using a iPhone SE it s typically hard for me to operate a full gesture on the cellphone and such a function although it s indeed pretty good doesn t necessarily helps me with my experience but make it worse in most times 
len ratingtwo Second translation is a critical function that needs updates 
len ratingtwo I ve also been using chrome on my MacBook and it s always good to have means to request a translation and see original text 
len ratingtwo But this is not working so well on IOS Chrome especially when I need a translation from English to other languages 
len ratingtwo I need to double check and skim both translated text and original ones whenever that I need to it s just something that s lacking consideration here 
len ratingtwo Third unlike Firefox and safari there a lagging area for previous pages 
len ratingtwo It s not quite helpful for me and also cause me an inconsistency when reading glancing at the articles 
len ratingtwo Also animation through pages is so bad I don t really ask Chrome to be as good as safari but at least make it like the Google app you guys have save some pages when you need to go back browsing news updates it s not really that hard right 
len ratingtwo Hope you guys can make iOS chrome better I really do 
len ratingone I updated the app on 
len ratingone I wish I hadn t 
len ratingone It was easily the best browser on the iPhone prior to the update 
len ratingone Now it s total garbage 
len ratingone Keyboard input is super laggy 
len ratingone The way it shows tabs is horrible 
len ratingone The google search page won t let me go back and add letters to existing text you hold your finger on the text and it opens the small zoom window 
len ratingone When you do that the little zoom window disappears and you can t input text 
len ratingone The app is totally broken 
len ratingone Thanks for nothing 
len ratingone Keyboard lag plus crappy safari design
len ratingthree After rolling dark mode for MacOs can we get a dark mode for iOS 
len ratingtwo  The newest update has significantly slowed down this app 
len ratingtwo The lag on using keyboard is horrific 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo I have iPhone Plus running on iOS and when I type the keyboard lags 
len ratingtwo This is for the last couple of day 
len ratingtwo Please fix it
len ratingone Chrome is basically getting unusable 
len ratingone Now they keyboard lags when typing and pages don t load going back to Safari
len ratingone There is no way to turn off the autoplaying of videos when doing things like Google searching and there are video hits 
len ratingone This is 
len ratingone Get your crap together Google 
len ratingone You know what you did 
len ratingone Fix it please 
len ratingfive  La traducci n de p ginas web es muy buena y fluida 
len ratingone One of my kids accidentally deleted chrome from my IPad I went into the store tried to download it says this version is outdated would I like the updated version I hit yes it downloads and then says could not download Chrome app at this time 
len ratingone Try again later 
len ratingone I have been trying for a couple of days now 
len ratingone Any ideas 
len ratingfour I would like to be able to make the fonts larger or have an easy read feature 
len ratingfour I keep my font larger on my phone because I m unable to see the smaller font well 
len ratingfour Please give us this option for those of us with vision impediments 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingtwo Reviewed as of March 
len ratingtwo I recently installed the Chrome update 
len ratingtwo I normally use Chrome very happily as my primary browser 
len ratingtwo With this update there seems to be a very bad keyboard lag 
len ratingtwo It s very distracting and nearly unusable 
len ratingtwo Google please fix
len ratingone  App crashes constantly while doing the simplest things 
len ratingone  The keyboard is beyond laggy 
len ratingone  Search suggestions are completely gone 
len ratingone If this isn t fixed within a week I m switching to a new browser 
len ratingfive give it a for the computer version because it s better than the app version
len ratingtwo  Ugh since I updated to this my bookmarks are stuck in an old version meaning they are from a few years ago 
len ratingtwo I can t get it to show the most recent and I ve done everything to fix google s fix 
len ratingtwo I love the chrome app but as of recent the app s keyboard is lagging so bad it s making the app unusable 
len ratingone I don t use this on iPhone but I use it on windows 
len ratingone And it is getting more and more annoying 
len ratingone Ads everywhere 
len ratingone Can t visit a sight without seeing an ad for it on the next sight I visit 
len ratingone Leave me alone already 
len ratingone Won t use chrome anymore 
len ratingone Like I said gbyd
len ratingtwo Typing in google chrome takes forever I m not sure what is wrong but it not my phone because I m easily typing this review right now 
len ratingtwo There s a huge delay in touch response time on the google chrome app 
len ratingthree I love Google Chrome and I use it on all of my devices but after the last update my phones keyboard is lagging only on this app 
len ratingthree I am not sure what this is about 
len ratingone There is bug while i want to translate a page from turkish language to english So much lags and i couldn t do anything 
len ratingfour Chrome is great 
len ratingfour Few suggestions Make Reader View available on Chrome like on Safari 
len ratingfour When I ask Siri to read the screen she goes through the site s table of contents which is annoying 
len ratingfour Plus when you view all yours tabs make the x to close at the bottom right of the tab for ergonomics sake 
len ratingfour Also have a function where you can easily switch from viewing something on the Google app to the Chrome app 
len ratingfour Chrome is the only app that the keyboard lags when typing 
len ratingfour Quite annoying 
len ratingfour I can t seem to figure out how to contact chrome support since the issue seems to be isolated in the chrome app 
len ratingfive Doing that made me reinstall Chrome again on my phone and computer 
len ratingfive Great job 
len ratingtwo Recent updates caused lag when typing almost unusable 
len ratingone I primarily use chrome synced up with my account for business purposes but the lagging is incredibly frustrating 
len ratingone I m going to be using safari until it s fixed 
len ratingone  Hey Google 
len ratingone Did you even test this update for one minute before you released it on an unsuspecting public 
len ratingone Autofill has disappeared from our solar system 
len ratingone Again how many times do we need to tell app developers to thoroughly test their apps and updates before releasing them 
len ratingone It s called a test script and it is the most basic and effective way of testing your work 
len ratingone Google putting something out as amateurish as this makes you look arrogant stupid lazy and incompetent 
len ratingone Well as Bill Parcells said you are what your record says you are 
len ratingone And this is a big loss 
len ratingone Congratulations on ruining a decent app 
len ratingone  Used to be an innovative product and company at the forefront of technology and speed 
len ratingone Now it s a copy of Safari crashes all the time slow memory hog the worst 
len ratingone Google used to be what every other tech company looked to and now they re operating products way below expectation 
len ratingone At this rate Google is the next Yahoo and Chrome the next IE 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingtwo  The keyboard is extremely laggy when using this app and this app only 
len ratingtwo I don t understand why but it should be fixed immediately as it is very annoying 
len ratingfive Problem was page auto translation
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone Keyboard is sooo slow autofill doesn t work sites take forever to load 
len ratingone My favorite browser is now useless 
len ratingone  There are a ton of settings missing from the Android version most of all dark mode and simplified view 
len ratingone  Recently the keyboard lag within the application is unbearable 
len ratingone To be clear the lag only occurs within Chrome 
len ratingone This app used to be my go to but it cannot keep up with my typing and is practically unusable at this point so much so that I ve started exploring other browser apps 
len ratingone Thus far Edge Safari and Brave built on Chromium so this one is odd all function significantly better 
len ratingtwo In the last three months of noticed chrome is lacking you can t hardly even use it to watch a video clip on you to as the developers of this app you need to keep it updated or remove your self from the market your app provides poor quality at best
len ratingfive Blugh nuff ergur me sammul ri ets huggc
len ratingtwo New updates clearly use more system resources and results in laggy slow keyboard typing on a iPhone
len ratingone Don t waste your time 
len ratingone Upgrade after upgrade and it will never open
len ratingfive  Like this app 
len ratingone The past updates cause the keyboard to be extremely laggy
len ratingfive  The only thing I want is the pull down action can be disabled 
len ratingtwo  I used to love having my desktop browser on my phone but over the past days it s been having major issues with typing input lag that make searching the web almost impossible 
len ratingtwo I have submitted feedback to google through chrome and will update the review once there is a patch available I just wanted to leave a negative review here to bring the bugs to the developers attention
len ratingtwo Pro 
len ratingtwo Same bookmarks as pc desktop and android phone version Con 
len ratingtwo Much slower than previously 
len ratingtwo Does not load in some long news site that other iOS browser does 
len ratingtwo Can not change font size set normal or minimum 
len ratingtwo Not text reflow when zooming in Can not override pages to allow zoom
len ratingone It s laggy and unresponsive on my new iPhone 
len ratingone Web pages have been crashing on their own as well 
len ratingfive sopasPsPasSsasssdSsospsspssrr
len ratingone Just make it work like it does on a desktop 
len ratingthree Got really slow and buggy recently 
len ratingthree Uninstalled and got Duck Duck Go 
len ratingthree Why settle when there s dozens of other options that aren t slower than the ceaseless approach of death 
len ratingone Seems some update made the browser basically unusable 
len ratingone Thought it was my phone but safari and even Edge seem to work faster 
len ratingthree Love Chrome but recent update caused keyboard lag and it makes the browser almost unusable 
len ratingthree Please correct 
len ratingone Im don t like this version I can t even do certain things for my school 
len ratingone So frustrating 
len ratingone  Lags when in search 
len ratingone Please message me when you fix will use Safari instead 
len ratingthree  When I click the visit button it won t send me to the website unless I press new tab 
len ratingthree Did I accidentally set up my settings or there is something wrong with Google chrome 
len ratingfive  It s a great browser
len ratingone Why did you completely ruin the app by making the tabs awful 
len ratingone Why did you have to take something good and piss all over it 
len ratingone Why didn t you leave it alone when it wasn t broken 
len ratingone I want you to sit in the corner and think about what you ve done 
len ratingone You should fire yourselves 
len ratingone Typing in the search address bar is painfully slow since the last update 
len ratingone I can t believe I have to use safari now 
len ratingone Get it together google 
len ratingone I ve been a Chrome user for at least years but in the last year or I find more and more websites not working properly in 
len ratingone Chrome but working fine in other browsers 
len ratingone The is true on iOS and even on my Windows PCs 
len ratingone If Safari was still available on PC I would be switching to it exclusively 
len ratingone I ve noticed more and more since the last update that typing in the search URL is incredibly laggy 
len ratingone You ll type a character and then have to wait before it ll register another one 
len ratingone I don t know if it s that they re synchronously trying to call their auto complete service and it s just really slow or what but it s really frustrating 
len ratingone Similar thing happens on their Maps app too 
len ratingfive Chrome has really helped me surprise
len ratingfive  The other child is
len ratingfive Seolle 
len ratingfive  Love it to be honest couldn t say anything better then this
len ratingtwo This app constantly crashes on my phone 
len ratingtwo I wish this issue would be fixed 
len ratingtwo I am always getting error messages 
len ratingone This app can t even play videos now 
len ratingone Absolutely junk
len ratingtwo Everyone is screaming to not use Chrome until you update it to prevent this Zero day exploit from messing up your life 
len ratingtwo No update days later 
len ratingtwo I guess Google wants to discourage its customers from using its products 
len ratingtwo MUSIC playing stops automatically when I open Chrome 
len ratingtwo How can I avoid that 
len ratingthree  Why is there an intrusive random link box that pops up whenever there s something in the images section that s completely random on where it comes and appears to be randomly related to what I m looking at even though if I wanted it I d have looked for it 
len ratingthree Its especially weird for the incognito necessary stuff if you get what I mean 
len ratingthree If I wanted an article on that I d have looked for it 
len ratingthree Seriously 
len ratingthree It s weird intrusive and slows down the flow of what I m seeing 
len ratingthree It s basically a huge reef spike in a vast open ocean that exists only where the sailing would be in that analogy 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s unremarkable in either direction 
len ratingthree Oh almost forgot no matter WHAT I look up I have to refresh it for it to work even for general searches like particular memes and political cartoons 
len ratingthree It s not like it s a website that changes 
len ratingthree NVM I just checked and the first search didn t do that but it HAD been doing that so keep an eye out for it 
len ratingone Features on desktop don t work on mobile NO EXTENSIONS SO EXPECT A PAGE FULL OF ADS SAFARI IS BETTER ON IPHONE
len ratingone Every time I go to type something in the browser there is a serious lag in the keyboard 
len ratingone Everything else on my phone works fine when I need to type something it s only in chrome I get the lag 
len ratingtwo Every time I type something into the search bar and hit enter and it will tell me This site cannot be reached And will show an ERR FAILED code at the bottom yet of I refresh the page it works fine 
len ratingtwo It seems to happen more when I am looking for news articles or information about current events more but that may just be me 
len ratingtwo It is very annoying and needs to be fixed promptly 
len ratingtwo This is my only issue 
len ratingtwo  Typing in the address bar is incredibly laggy for seemingly no reason Reordering tabs is a nightmare that often ends in a tab flying to the very top or bottom because of a UI issue Search autofill will usually just give you suggestions from one off searches months ago rather than pages you frequently visit Browser is somewhat okay overall but these issues really drag it down hard 
len ratingtwo Would appreciate some fixes 
len ratingone Any time I try to use the Chrome app it crashes no matter what I do it just stops working 
len ratingone I have no issue at all with any other apps I use the Google browser without issue all the time I can t figure out why it just doesn t work 
len ratingfour Heard there is a update 
len ratingfour Is it not for apps 
len ratingone This app used to be the go to app now it s very inconvenient the way everything is laid out and it makes my battery die extremely fast I never had issues with the app before but I really have no use for this app
len ratingone don t like
len ratingthree Especially Reddit Everytime I click a link it just open up blank Google chrome tab
len ratingtwo What the heck 
len ratingtwo I ve been sending clients to Chrome for their cell phones so they could easily go into settings and clear the browser cache but with the latest update i can no longer find that option under Settings 
len ratingtwo Guess I ll go back to using Safari as my primary browser and stop recommending chrome to our clients 
len ratingtwo Chrome used to be the only browser that allowed you to clear cache from the browser window but apparently no longer 
len ratingtwo This is a major pain for web designers 
len ratingone For many many months now it s like every keystroke is being copied to a cloud clipboard and is so extremely slow or some bookmark autocomplete is slowing everything down 
len ratingone Very very very Very annoying 
len ratingone What s the point of trying to use Chrome everywhere when it s this slow 
len ratingone Probably going back to safari 
len ratingone What a mess 
len ratingone And recently when too many tabs are open new browser tabs just don t load 
len ratingone Either Apple is purposefully crippling the Chrome browser or the devs are just failing 
len ratingtwo It baffles me why they took a superior sliding tab layout and put it in a grid format 
len ratingtwo It s basic iOS design philosophy that it s almost always better to design features with sliding fluid and physics based movement yet they did the exact opposite 
len ratingtwo I want to be able to easily slide through my tabs and flick to close 
len ratingtwo At this point it s better for me just to go back to Safari 
len ratingone Google do something
len ratingone This app is the worst search bowser because it drains your battery and is slow They aren t the fastest anymore because Microsoft edge is here It is way faster and uses way less power and is easier to understand
len ratingfive When I got it forced me to do school work
len ratingfour  Good apps
len ratingfive chrome is an app like google but helps u adventure a lot more for example u can keep what uu have read and be like can read this another time and boom u saved it
len ratingone It locked me out
len ratingone Tried to hang on to chrome for sometime because I was convinced it was the best but got fed up of it defaulting to a different language that I don t prefer after weeks of trying everything deleted chrome from my laptop and phone switched to another browser 
len ratingone I just got my brand new iPhone and Chrome crashes constantly due to add ons
len ratingfive Weeweww ee w you w qewwwwq was weewew woweeqewwa wwwwwwy you like to be the one you are going through to me and I will do you yyyyyytyiuuiiuuuiuuuuuuujjijijjiyjjjkujjjjjkkjjjjjjjjjkkkjikkkkkjjjkkkjjjjjjjjjjjjjyiuuuuuuuuyyyuyuyuuyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuiiuuiuuuyujijtjhwjgj
len ratingfive  Google is one of my favorite websites
len ratingtwo Very disappointing update 
len ratingtwo Certain websites take forever to load 
len ratingtwo Even then they don t load properly and I have to refresh the page 
len ratingtwo Sometimes the app crashing while having to tabs open 
len ratingtwo I m on the latest iOS
len ratingone Fix the problem
len ratingone Every time I try to move a tab from one place to another it will automatically go to the top most and I have to drag it down from all the way from the top to bottom 
len ratingone Very irritating
len ratingone When I open the browser I get an alert that states for example Facebook does not support this version of this browser 
len ratingone Please update 
len ratingone Never had an issue before 
len ratingone Uninstalling
len ratingone  The most recent update is horrible 
len ratingone They completely removed the simple user friendly mobile version of google to make it look like the desktop version 
len ratingone The desktop version is great as long as its on a desktop 
len ratingone iPhones come with safari already installed and the people who are going to go search for and download your app are the people who don t like safari 
len ratingone So why the f ck did you make your app into a clone of safari 
len ratingone I hope u fix this because for now ill just be using safari to save space on my phone since there pretty much the same app now
len ratingfive  This Ryobi pressure washer works awesome 
len ratingfive I used it to clean my mower deck Very pleased with it a lot of power 
len ratingone I was expecting the usual bug fix and small added features but the update brought a complete rehaul of the browser 
len ratingone It is not user friendly and completely made the reasons for using chrome null
len ratingfive Tivi
len ratingone  Didn t load a single page
len ratingfour  I have been using Samsung browser on my android phones 
len ratingfour I love the interface 
len ratingfour I could save shortcuts of my favorite web pages on the home page and there is a Home button showing during browsing web pages 
len ratingfour How convenient is it 
len ratingfour I could switch to all my favorite web pages in one second 
len ratingfour Simply click on the home button and all shortcuts are showing on the home page 
len ratingfive This app is amazing I recommend using this app rather then safari 
len ratingfive I believe like this because safari is much slower and google really adapts to was you search recommending more things that you may be looking for 
len ratingfive Thanks for the heads up concerning Chrome 
len ratingfive You just confirmed my already thoughts that they were fixing something that wasn t broken 
len ratingfive Hands off Chrome 
len ratingfive  Yes you know the app and it does get better with you working on it to check out what I was working online good app 
len ratingfive Thanks for the upgrade 
len ratingfive  I think this app will continue fix this problems give them chance Becca Kalis
len ratingthree My keyboard is working really slowly on the chrome browser 
len ratingthree I don t know why but it s just on the app 
len ratingthree That stress me so much 
len ratingthree Please st google repair this mistake 
len ratingfour Up until this week Chrome has been great 
len ratingfour Now when attempting to go to pretty much any website it goes to the desired sight for a few seconds reverts back to the Google Chrome home page on my ipad 
len ratingfour I hope a fix is in the works soon 
len ratingone If it ain t broke don t fix it 
len ratingone This update changed the way that previous results are listed on the google home page 
len ratingone Instead of showing related previous searches while you type your keywords it now displays a truncated list of your previous searches AFTER you ve already searched 
len ratingone An utterly useless feature that in fact breaks a previously useful one 
len ratingone See you can turn off remembered results but if you do you don t see your previous searches while typing either so there s no shortcut after your browser crashes to reload your previous search just by typing 
len ratingone  I m going back to safari 
len ratingone Everytime I get an update something goes wrong with my app 
len ratingone And I have to download it again why is that 
len ratingone And also it kicks me out of other apps make me have to sign in are you tapping my phone 
len ratingone That s not legal 
len ratingfour Pretty good app it s reliable and a bit better than what I usually use I say you should get it 
len ratingfive This google drive has let me accomplish so many things in life vote five stars for this wonderful website and make sure add a comment
len ratingtwo No plugins not like PC version so you can t block advertisements
len ratingthree I always preferred firefox for PC but I went all google on iOS gmail gmaps youtube etc 
len ratingthree Now the thing is I don t like the roboto font and really think material design fits with iOS 
len ratingthree I like the old chrome app more because of its design then because this new one it oversimplified 
len ratingthree When I exit the app my battery operates normally but when I am using Chrome suddenly my battery display would always be stuck on 
len ratingthree Not a big problem but it is annoying and distracting 
len ratingfive Slide into incognito 
len ratingfive A whole new layout 
len ratingfive Ok Google 
len ratingone  Don t use this unless you want to live in 
len ratingone Google wants to control what you read online and ultimately how you think 
len ratingtwo Google used to be a browser that I liked a lot 
len ratingtwo However with Google continually driving a left wing agenda and firing employees that have any kind of conservative opinions I am consciously trying to avoid Chrome 
len ratingtwo Additionally their tie to all kinds of apps You Tube where they are Geo Targeting you is SUPER CREEPY
len ratingfive Gave stars 
len ratingfive Great customer service 
len ratingfive Super attitude Accommodating and ease to mak friend 
len ratingfive Car was iMac ukase
len ratingtwo Actually not very good 
len ratingtwo Can t zoom 
len ratingtwo Saved passwords often aren t filled in 
len ratingtwo Safari is much much better 
len ratingone Google chrome for an iPhone is absolutely the worst convoluted garbage app ever 
len ratingone Plain google worked so much better when it saved your searches in the search box and in history 
len ratingone I absolutely HATE google chrome 
len ratingone What a waste 
len ratingone Time to find a new search engine 
len ratingone Get the regular google search engine it s better 
len ratingfour Ability to tag websites to read later is helpful I use it all the time 
len ratingfour However google developers would ve been smart to take this feature a few steps further to be able to create folders within the read later option 
len ratingfour Enable users to create bookmark these sites directly from read later list 
len ratingfour As it is if I want to add a permanent bookmark to a site I ve marked as read later I have to open the site and create bookmark from that point 
len ratingfour It should be doable just from the read later list 
len ratingfour Chrome is still the fastest and most user friendly web search engine out there 
len ratingthree Given that i own a chromebook i have essentially no choice but to use this browser 
len ratingthree But although seemingly a small gripe when an AMP website comes up all of the pull down gestures cease to function so my muscle memory for closing or reloading a tab fails me 
len ratingthree It s a small thing but hugely inconvenient given that the chrome interface has gotten smaller and smaller for valuable tasks in recent updates 
len ratingthree  It seems that we whom are the elderly are ignored 
len ratingthree However some of us are listening watching as our democracy is slowing but surely being destroyed by Mr Trump 
len ratingthree This must be a number one issue 
len ratingthree He and his compatriots DO NOT have our country s REAL issues or our country s needs on their agenda 
len ratingthree Our precious animals have no where to live and procreate 
len ratingthree Our pride in our history is has been destroyed 
len ratingthree Many of our countries history is disappearing 
len ratingthree This is what I see hear and ask you to help find solutions 
len ratingthree Please and thank you for your interest 
len ratingone  For many many months now it s like every keystroke is being copied to a cloud clipboard and is so extremely slow 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingone What s the point of trying to use Chrome everywhere when it s this slow 
len ratingone Probably going back to safari 
len ratingone What a mess 
len ratingfive join the nine year old army
len ratingtwo Hello Please fix the translation issue within Chrome 
len ratingtwo It was not resolved with the prior update 
len ratingtwo Otherwise I love Chrome and love the mobile app 
len ratingfour It has it s shuts downs because it says google chrome hasn t shut down properly would you like to restore I keep having to go thru that randomly more often Idk if it s a bug 
len ratingfour Can t be fixed 
len ratingone The new update is very recharging the battery 
len ratingtwo Use a lot background activity and no option to turn it off 
len ratingtwo So I uninstalled it 
len ratingtwo Bye
len ratingone Why am I forced to sign in to the app itself when browsing a google service 
len ratingone I expected the same experience I get in my desktop experience and was very disappointed 
len ratingone  RerrrrrrrrrrrrrrtrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrddrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrerrrrrrrrrrrrrderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrdrrerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrdrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrerrrrrrddrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrdrrrrrerrrrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrdrdrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrderrrrdrrrrrereerrrrerrrrrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrddrrdrrrretdrerrrrrrrrerrerrrrrrrrrRerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrdrrrrrrrrdrrrrrdddrdr
len ratingtwo  Used to be an innovative product and company at the forefront of technology and speed 
len ratingtwo Now it s a copy of Safari crashes all the time slow memory hog the worst 
len ratingtwo Google used to be what every other tech company looked to and now they re operating products way below expectation 
len ratingtwo At this rate Google is the next Yahoo and Chrome the next IE 
len ratingtwo Sad 
len ratingfour This app is wonderful because well I like Chrome 
len ratingfour But when the app freezes then crashes I lose all my open tabs 
len ratingfour It s very frustrating especially when your trying to get work done 
len ratingfour Then you try to recall what you had open only to just say it gotta start all over again 
len ratingone  Ive asked an never ending amount of ios and droid chrome users if they use the page pull down refresh or even like it Out of people the last year or so I have only come across that said yes 
len ratingone Asked them why they like it and they didn t even know why for what reason or a particular site that they need to use it on Nearly any site that might possibly have needed the option to be useful years ago now uses a separate frame window widget api etc to display the content realtime without having to refresh the entire page 
len ratingone Because of this I still only rarely use a mobile chrome browser for syncing and random pages that don t load properly on safari puffin or firefox 
len ratingone You want to collect data from users and make more money while not being evil then at the very least offer setting to disable it 
len ratingone For the last week or so the app keeps crashing 
len ratingone When it crashes I lose all tabs I had opened 
len ratingone This app seems to get worse with every update 
len ratingone They need to start reverting backwards to improve the app 
len ratingfive Wow believe it this will make your feet beautiful 
len ratingfive Gets rid of rough calluses 
len ratingfive I saw improvements in just a few days 
len ratingfive  absolutely amazing 
len ratingfive Read the title idiot
len ratingthree I agree with the above guy I miss my save button family and friends post pictures on Facebook I would like to be able to save for myself 
len ratingthree Disappointed not finding that available rather readily available 
len ratingtwo The last thing that annoyed me was using the Recent Tabs under the menu now it replaces the current tab with an old one why would it do that 
len ratingtwo The Back button is disabled so the tab I was just looking at is gone 
len ratingtwo And it isn t listed in Recent Tabs so I have to open it from History if I can find it and the tab Back button has lost the previous pages 
len ratingtwo I have to train myself to open a new tab before using Recent Tabs 
len ratingtwo Grrrrrrrrr
len ratingone  The quality of the wood was quite good but besides being small the back of the drawer was missing also it took me too much time to make it
len ratingone  Remove swipe down reload and 
len ratingfive The new interface is great 
len ratingfive Much cleaner and easier to use 
len ratingthree They put the period next to a the space bar 
len ratingthree every time I type a sentence into search I end up with a period between every word instead of a space and end up deleting everything and starting over 
len ratingfive Isn t it the same as Google itself 
len ratingfive They are both on the internet and they both use google as a internet explorer 
len ratingfive However I don t really love the tabs that you get to open 
len ratingfive They just make it confusing 
len ratingfive Excellent service 
len ratingfive Floors look new
len ratingone  Adp doosin urk I wog en n sermeria si nut dur y uggest dat u no by urp do soomen esle
len ratingthree Works well for most thing today after a history cleanup cookies could not be re enabled
len ratingone Didn t used to do this 
len ratingfive I have many years experience with the Android phone and IPhone 
len ratingfive There is just a matter of fact that the IPHONE is far greater and much easier to find what you need 
len ratingfive This app is amazing
len ratingtwo It always freezes and I need to close tabs and restart app 
len ratingtwo I find myself using Safari more often 
len ratingtwo Safari has become much more reliable
len ratingfive  The Blessings just don t stop coming though I still don t know how to collect theme but I know one that always opens doors of blessings 
len ratingfive it s my secret but I can t hold on to it any longer and I half to let the World know 
len ratingfive I know him by Jesus Christ and he is my healer my redeemer my counselor the one who lifts up my head he forgave my sin way back on Calvary Cross he cast them to the depth s of the see and never remembered theme and today he is still representing me holly before he judgement Throne of God 
len ratingfive He s the best of all the rest nothing compares to his love 
len ratingfive the one and only that could have created the Universe at the sound of his voice he takes care of what I can t for accomplish of overcome with my own strength 
len ratingfive Brigido Jr L C 
len ratingthree  the update that put the new tab button at the bottom 
len ratingthree F that s man 
len ratingthree I can spend a solid flipping seconds trying to hit that at the bottom of the window only to repeatedly open one of the two bottom tabs I have open 
len ratingthree RRRRRR
len ratingone Just use actual Chrome on a computer it works way better then this app which has disappointed me more then I expected 
len ratingone I love using this app but the update has completely threw me off 
len ratingone I often use google and when I m scrolling down my fingers are always on the bottom of the screen and swiping things all the time 
len ratingone I read a lot and the new google update isn t helping 
len ratingone I prefer the old version where everything is on top of the screen where I can easily swipe up to hide and not accidentally click a button to go back or forth when I don t need to 
len ratingone I just want to know if there s anyway to downgrade the app 
len ratingone I also had over tabs open 
len ratingone I lost it all in an instant and have NO way of getting them back 
len ratingone I haven t the slightest clue what majority of the tabs were called and it s extremely difficult to try to find EVERYTHING all over again which I don t have time for 
len ratingone I need a section in which the tabs I have recently deleted ON ACCIDENT CAUSE IM NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY WILLINGLY DO THAT can be replaced in an instant 
len ratingone Without going into my history because let s be honest 
len ratingone History is a mix of what happened on one tab 
len ratingone NOT ON ALL TABS THAT WE HAD 
len ratingone It s really starting to annoy me by how google chrome is starting to fail 
len ratingtwo It s basically a revamped version of safari The pop ups keep coming through and crashing web pages no matter how many times I block them 
len ratingone Can filter matches on criteria that are important to me such as politics education or distance in big city traffic miles is too far 
len ratingfive Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle
len ratingone More bug s
len ratingone Chrome used to be the best mobile browser but after both the latest iOS and Chrome app updates all chrome does is crash and restart in a nonstop loop 
len ratingfive Wonderful 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone App has become unusable after recent updates 
len ratingone I am unable to load webpages or fill forms through this browser 
len ratingone If I wanted safari I would use safari 
len ratingone This new update is ugly and inconvenient 
len ratingone Please go back 
len ratingone  I tried to open the webpages but it took too long to respond so if chrome could update then it would be better so you guys can have more webpages load more faster and a better update
len ratingthree I ve been using chrome for the past months 
len ratingthree With the most recent update it s been crashing frequently 
len ratingthree Please fix this with your next update 
len ratingtwo Instagram was deleted by me and now it is showing that I am on it 
len ratingtwo It is a major problem for me 
len ratingtwo Would like a quick response please 
len ratingone Never seen that before 
len ratingone Try it 
len ratingone I m guessing that the latest update got so many bad reviews that Google asked Apple to disable it 
len ratingone They re hiding OUR reviews of the current Chrome update 
len ratingone I can select every other option 
len ratingone Just not most recent reviews 
len ratingone Selecting Most critical shows some very recent reviews so just put one and one together 
len ratingone They ask for our reviews and then they hide them when they don t like them 
len ratingfive I love all this google so you know this will be good 
len ratingfour  I think Google Chrome is better than Safari 
len ratingfour Sometimes it is slow and doesn t wanna load but that could also be my internet playing apart 
len ratingfour But so far good chrome has done perfectly fine for me 
len ratingone Yes Google I am aware of this feature 
len ratingone I do not need you to remind me of it with that little blue pop up EVERY TIME I OPEN THE BROWSER 
len ratingtwo Decade long chrome user on any of its platforms until this latest iteration 
len ratingtwo The developers have finally managed to update and change it into a browser that is no longer usable 
len ratingtwo Finally made the switch to using safari about months ago 
len ratingone I figured out how to play YouTube videos in the background and I m not paying you a month to do it either 
len ratingone I have two iPhone s yes the original that Steve Jobs created 
len ratingone  new batteries too Play any video you want on YouTube just like you should be able to for free on the old iPhone and it works perfectly purchase on eBay for don t give google another penny of your hard earned money 
len ratingone  months its money in the bank They can t fix the iPhone it will always play anything in the background even on chrome Safari whatever browser you choose 
len ratingone Used to be a great company then they started charging you a month for YouTube red just to play an audio clips in the background don t you make enough money at google you greedy greedy people 
len ratingfour You give me night mode theme I give you five stars 
len ratingone The latest update does not work with chrome cast 
len ratingone Please fix asap 
len ratingtwo Why did google get rid of the custom date range search on mobile devices 
len ratingtwo I have an iPad Pro that I use for research 
len ratingtwo I often use the custom date range search option 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately it s no longer available 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo Why would google do this 
len ratingtwo Have they gone mad 
len ratingtwo are they trying to limit our ability to get information from the past 
len ratingtwo Is this some form of control over what we have access too 
len ratingtwo What gives and why aren t people up in arms about google restricting our access to time related material on mobile devices 
len ratingtwo Maybe they want to make the communist Chinese leaders happy 
len ratingtwo Very sad bad google 
len ratingone After the new update the keyboard will pop up OVER the text box 
len ratingone How stupid 
len ratingone It s made the app entirely unusable as I can t see what I m trying to type 
len ratingone Insanely frustrating 
len ratingone This used to be my MAIN app I would download on any and all devices and now I question if I want to even keep it on a single device now 
len ratingone They updated the app and now it crashes 
len ratingone Constantly 
len ratingone Never was a problem before so don t bother with it until they get it fixed because it s unusable 
len ratingone Really disappointed in the duplication of bookmarks 
len ratingone Hi for some reason chrome covers any text field making it imposible to write correctly please fix this 
len ratingone  How can I delete chrome from my iPhone
len ratingone  Why would someone download chrome if there is already Safari And Safari is really good and better than chrome 
len ratingone Also Google Chrome waste more battery
len ratingfive It s good
len ratingtwo  The program does not work with the site of YouTube when converting the browser to the desktop can not modify the browser user s videos please solve this problem
len ratingfive  Powerful Worship Experience I Agree and Declaring to Say sickness be gone now In Jesus Christ Name and the Power of His Blood 
len ratingfive IN JESUS CHRIST NAME AMEN 
len ratingfive Thank you Jesus Christ 
len ratingone Used to be a pleasant alternative to Safari 
len ratingone But you made it almost impossible now to do a reverse image search 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Why is removing something considered an update 
len ratingone Terrible awful 
len ratingone Mrs Minnie needs to bake y all a special pie for this piece of crap 
len ratingfive  Best internet app
len ratingone Update version keeps crashing and won t open pages on start up
len ratingone Breaking my silence in the yrs I ve shopped in the App Store w o one review to express my frustration w the most recent update to the Google Chrome app that I m using on my new generation iPad 
len ratingone One it auto updated so that p ssed me off on sight 
len ratingone Then when I saw how utterly hideous the pages were that added a whole other level of outrage 
len ratingone I ve been too busy this week to research ways to reverse the update like I successfully did with my phone and got a feel for the performance which not to my surprise is also lackluster 
len ratingone Additionally the bottom toolbar that holds the autocorrect fill covers the content near the bottom of the page which was not the case in previous versions 
len ratingone So not only am I being force fed your incompetence I will also be forced to look at your ugly mug during that realization 
len ratingone No bueno 
len ratingone The Google s privacy violations were more than enough actively researching alternatives 
len ratingone  No search engines were added
len ratingfive I left a bad review before but I forget exactly why 
len ratingfive The app is good 
len ratingfive Chrome feels more like a native iOS app than Safari does 
len ratingone I swear by Chrome on my desktop but Chrome on iOS is completely useless 
len ratingone If you go to almost any mobile webpage you know that they are just covered with intrusive ads by companies like taboola and outbrain and also auto play misleading ad videos and such 
len ratingone You can disable these things with rd party content blockers if the browser supports using them 
len ratingone Chrome does not so Chrome is essentially saying they re okay with giving you an ad filled web experience 
len ratingone Just say no 
len ratingthree With last update now most links in my gmail just open a home chrome window but don t navigate to the page 
len ratingthree Something broke 
len ratingthree Used to work flawlessly 
len ratingtwo  I figured out how to play YouTube videos in the background and I m not paying you a month to do it either 
len ratingtwo I have two iPhone s yes the original that Steve Jobs created 
len ratingtwo  new batteries too Play any video you want on YouTube just like you should be able to for free on the old iPhone and it works perfectly purchase on eBay for don t give google another penny of your hard earned money 
len ratingtwo  months its money in the bank They can t fix the iPhone it will always play anything in the background even on chrome Safari whatever browser you choose 
len ratingtwo Used to be a great company then they started charging you a month for YouTube red just to play an audio clips in the background don t you make enough money at google you greedy greedy people 
len ratingone Newest update constantly crashes
len ratingfive  Really good 
len ratingone This is crap now 
len ratingone Every time I use it it thinks I m a freaking bot so I have to do the security tiles every time to prove I m human 
len ratingone It keeps saying there is unusual traffic coming from my IP 
len ratingone News flash I m always doing a search idiots various topics different reasons from homework to recreation 
len ratingone Now it seems I can t search at all now on my iOS 
len ratingone Another once great browser gone to trash 
len ratingone I haves used chrome for years and loved it but recently I can t use it at all due to crashes 
len ratingone Can t even recover the tabs after 
len ratingfour Your updates keep closingbmy open tabs 
len ratingfour At least reopen my tabs after updating the app 
len ratingthree The new Chrome update was awesome but it s been crashing a lot lately closing all of my tabs 
len ratingthree Hoping for a fix soon 
len ratingone New update is awful now I remember why I never update 
len ratingone I wish I hadn t I don t want a safari look alike 
len ratingone I LIKE having the bar at the top 
len ratingone And the way the tabs are organized 
len ratingone PLEASE give us the option to go back to the old view 
len ratingone I will gladly give stars for that 
len ratingone Also I had tabs I had been saving for a few months not that many tabs and it still crashed and lost them all 
len ratingone They were only accessible through direct link so basically I m never getting them back without a ton of work 
len ratingone Awful awful update 
len ratingfive I love hallmark diy and I love the show I watch it every day I think google is a very good thing
len ratingtwo  Chrome has been crashing since the update 
len ratingtwo I usually have to open it times now to get it to work 
len ratingtwo Hopefully will be updated and fixed soon or else I m going back to safari 
len ratingfive Best browser
len ratingfive Love the app but one thing that keeps me in safari is the ad block feature 
len ratingfive This app needs a ad block like chrome on computer 
len ratingone Popup blocker seems to be broken after the recent update 
len ratingone  Find in page functionality is broken also 
len ratingone i ve literally never had an app as poorly designed as this or one that crashes so much
len ratingone Hi I love chrome it s my number one browser but recently it has keeper crashing every minute I m trying to use it 
len ratingone I barley can search anything without the app crashing three time 
len ratingone Another problem I m having is when I do get to search something I have to type in my search times before it loads the page up 
len ratingone Hopefully this can be fixed soon or I ll have to start using another browser because frankly the current app is unusable 
len ratingthree The stupid close all tab that always near my fingers no matter which angle I turn my phone 
len ratingthree I keep closing all the tabs and constantly have to undo it
len ratingthree One constant source of frustration is the voice search 
len ratingthree It will not stop listening and execute the search with even a small amount of background noise 
len ratingthree This makes the feature useless at least half the time 
len ratingthree It picks up exactly what I want to search but just will not stop listening and do it 
len ratingthree Add a button to manually run the search on demand and this will be solved 
len ratingthree I ll upgrade my rating to stars if this is added 
len ratingone Can we have the option to revert back to the old UI 
len ratingone  I couldn t fit my whole butt in it 
len ratingone  I used to love chrome but it s getting unusable on IOS because of the continual crashes 
len ratingone So unstable it s not even funny 
len ratingone I had hoped it was just Google trying to shut down sites by deliberately crashing on them but it seems to do the same on virtually any blog these days 
len ratingone Maybe it s dying because of the ad overload it tries to push
len ratingfive  It s a great app I love it 
len ratingfive RGB CLW 
len ratingone Chrome use to be amazing but it keeps crashing and all my tabs keep closing unexpectedly 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed
len ratingone And no way to revert back 
len ratingone New pages are ugly and clumsy 
len ratingone It feels far less orderly and organized than before and uses schticks like animations for opening links in a new tab 
len ratingone I do not like it very much 
len ratingone A once perfect app since the latest update my browsers crashes unexpectedly every other time I open the app 
len ratingone Very disappointed with what once worked fine for me 
len ratingfive  Apple I cloud
len ratingone  Avoid if you don t want your searches and online privacy to be curated monitored and recorded by this leftist run monopoly 
len ratingone There are better browsers out there 
len ratingone Duckduckgo is an exceptional search engine that is built on protecting your privacy and not steering you towards a biased agenda 
len ratingone Time to kick google to the curb 
len ratingone Will not retain username domain plus password for work same for Google while Edge and Safari boot right up 
len ratingone In fact Google Chrome caused so many failed logins that I was locked out of work and had to call tech services to unlock my account 
len ratingone Utter fail by Google 
len ratingfive  I have no problem with google but I do think there security feature needs to be fixed up I lost my same account times recovered it times feels bed but I m over it
len ratingone Chrome has gone from my favorite browser in iOS to the biggest disappointment on the app store 
len ratingone The recent interface overhaul is clunky browsing is slower tab management is unnecessarily cumbersome and simple things that set it apart previously such as button placement have almost entirely changed 
len ratingone Now it s just a slow Safari clone with worse features 
len ratingone I submitted similar feedback via the app but received no response there used to be a way to revert to the old interface but that was recently removed 
len ratingone Really unfortunate to see this app fall apart so greatly 
len ratingone Sad to say it s no longer my default browser 
len ratingone Not worth the download at least until or if it s fixed 
len ratingfive Seriously 
len ratingfive What is the difference between chromonium and google canary 
len ratingfive Google needs to be put down 
len ratingone App is slow to load lately 
len ratingone Not sure why 
len ratingone It used to be faster than safari but is currently much slower 
len ratingone Leaving a star review for now because there is no longer a green lock icon it just a lock icon 
len ratingone This may be a small grievance but a big part of chrome has always been the ease of security built in 
len ratingone The green lock icon vs just a lock icon is not a great design decision 
len ratingone  New UI is horrible and has forced me to delete and download a new browsing app 
len ratingone Idiots change something that was already working 
len ratingone If it broke WHY THE HEL YOU GONNA CHANGE IT
len ratingone Not only the app but the entire browser bout efficient as windows or a one leg man in a buttkicking contest
len ratingone  With the ad blocking and other extensions readily available for the desktop version along with the excellent bookmark and history browsing syncing I think Chrome is the best however the IOS version leaves out most of that and is but a shell of the desktop version 
len ratingone And there s no built in reader like in Safari no synced reading lists from desktop to mobile and vice versa the IOS version needs a LOT of work 
len ratingone I really want to support the iOSversion of Chrome but I just can t until it has as good of functionality as the desktop version 
len ratingone That said I imagine Apple is partly to blame for a strong iOSversion 
len ratingfive  I like safari i like edge i like internet explorer i like firefox and also i like chrome This review is like a poem 
len ratingone  Ever since the last update Chrome has been crashing several times a day 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingthree When ever I leave google and don t close the window for a period of time it shows one of my recent incognito tabs open and this could be very frustrating especially because I share my phone with people sometimes 
len ratingthree This is very embarrassing sometimes 
len ratingone The app spontaneously crashes every time I open it causing the loss of any tabs I have open 
len ratingone This app used to be good 
len ratingone I used it instead of safari on my iPhone 
len ratingone But with the new update it s too much like safari 
len ratingone I downloaded FireFox and I m loving that so far

len ratingthree Chrome is totally good but the only thing we really need is download button which is really necessary
len ratingtwo I love Google Chrome but this newest version crashes a ton and I just lost all of my tabs 
len ratingtwo No restore button 
len ratingfive  I think this app is very Gucci 
len ratingfive It works well for me 
len ratingfive It is very easy to use 
len ratingone  input text boxes are now hidden behind the keyboard when typing in chrome because the page won t automatically adjust for them 
len ratingone i m going back to safari until this issue is resolved 
len ratingthree I want to be able to set fav websites on the New Tab page or at least make Bookmarks more accessible 
len ratingthree In one click 
len ratingthree Right now I need to tap the Bookmark icon then choose one of the proprietary folders and then SCROLL all the way down to my custom folders and only then I find my website 
len ratingthree UX team you re not living up to the expectations 
len ratingthree  Just cleared all my tabs because clear all is on front page and so can be accidentally bumped 
len ratingthree In contrast the save function is buried on the nd page of a drop down list 
len ratingthree There is no replace function in the apple version as opposed to the desktop version 
len ratingthree History doesn t exist either 
len ratingthree It only shows what is currently open not what was closed
len ratingone  Ever since the latest update Jan the app crashes extremely frequently 
len ratingone I don t know how you take something that works and breaks it but they did 
len ratingone I hate safari but at least it doesn t crash 
len ratingone Chrome seems to be crashing every time I use it 
len ratingone It s very frustration 
len ratingtwo Please
len ratingone  New update is awful now I remember why I never update 
len ratingone I wish I hadn t 
len ratingone I don t want a safari look alike 
len ratingone I LIKE having the bar at the top 
len ratingone And the way the tabs are organized 
len ratingone PLEASE give us the option to go back to the old view 
len ratingone I will gladly give stars for that 
len ratingone Chrome now crashes immediately when I try to go to any page 
len ratingone It s unusable on iOS 
len ratingone  This browser is not secure Please do not store any personal info or CC There are videos on YouTube showing how easy it is too access others Google is so out of touch with its own products it is disturbing
len ratingtwo  every time i go to click in a text box on facebook and twitter i don t want the apps so i use their mobile websites clicking in text boxes to type results in me not being able to see what i m typing because there s a UI bug where it s not moving the screen for the keyboard 
len ratingtwo i m sure it s the issues on other sites but these are the only i actually type in boxes at 
len ratingtwo  clicking on my recent favorites when i m on a blank tab results in the search bar moving and then nothing these are the only user journeys i really take in chrome and they re buggy 
len ratingtwo literally debating going back to safari rn 
len ratingone Okay I ve searched for something and it was nice to be able to go back to the search results and have them all still there so I could try multiple options for finding what I wanted 
len ratingone But that doesn t mean it s the only thing I EVER will want to search for 
len ratingone I try changing my search terms to refine my results and Chrome snaps it back to the last thing I searched for maybe thinking that I had made a mistake when I changed it 
len ratingone I don t get it 
len ratingone Also before you d get the sponsored or recommended results first and you d understand that you had to scroll past those ones to find what you needed 
len ratingone Now there s nothing past those ones 
len ratingone Maybe I m going off the deep end maybe there are some bugs with the new version that have yet to be ironed out but boy is it sure annoying in the meantime 
len ratingone Like someone else said if I wanted to use Safari I would 
len ratingone Don t be like Safari 
len ratingone  So in the latest update I cannot scroll up when the keyboard is on the screen 
len ratingone This is a critical issue I m typing blind or not at all 
len ratingone This is an issue across MULTIPLE device types and accounts iPhone iPad and in incognito mode 
len ratingone It is frustrating and infuriating 
len ratingone I m deleting and going back to Safari 
len ratingone  So in the latest update I cannot scroll up when the keyboard is on the screen 
len ratingone This is an issue on my iPhone iPad and in incognito mode It is frustrating and infuriating 
len ratingone I m deleting and going back to Safari 
len ratingone The newest update has caused the app to crash almost every time I start a search in the search bar 
len ratingone App crashes to home screen and then gives the option to restore previous tabs 
len ratingone But then crashes again if I start a search 
len ratingone Fix please 
len ratingone I keep automatic updates of for reasons like this 
len ratingone Updated chrome and now it is unusable trash 
len ratingone Physically can not hold my phone and use this new layout 
len ratingone Finally I can officially purge this cia company crap off my phone 
len ratingone Use Safari or Firefox 
len ratingone Heck Chrome won t even allow use of Gmail as my default mail app 
len ratingone Firefox does 
len ratingone And Chrome doesn t let me use duckduckgo as my default search engine as both Safari and Firefox do 
len ratingone Very low tech 
len ratingone They ought to pay me to use Chrome 
len ratingone But no they make ME pay I am their data merchandise 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingfive  Why I can see English translations on the series thank you
len ratingone Google hates the President Why would you have a image of put our president Donald Trump show up when someone search idiot If I could I would take you to court 
len ratingtwo App is causing phone to randomly restart 
len ratingtwo Uninstalled now won t be using again 
len ratingtwo I am not interested in the pop up new articles that pops up constantly 
len ratingtwo I am requesting that you remove them 
len ratingtwo They are distracting annoying and not of interest to me 
len ratingtwo I chose the time in my schedule for news not you 
len ratingone I used chrome on my laptop because ie was slow and horrible I used chrome on my phone because safari was ugly and inconvenient 
len ratingone Now chrome looks like safari acts like safari and crashes like safari 
len ratingone No actually safari runs BETTER than chrome does now 
len ratingone Try fixing the bugs and not overhauling the UI every month 
len ratingone The reason chrome won t offer the option to use the old layout is because nobody would use the new one 
len ratingone Because it s garbage 
len ratingone I might have to switch to safari because the new keyboard bug makes using a chat box at the bottom of the page impossible 
len ratingone And that s what I spend of my time on the app doing typing 
len ratingone Can t copy or paste because you can t see the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone Safari at least knows to put the keyboard below the page 
len ratingfive People can act all jealous because they don t have it and downgraded but there s no getting around it Apple is the best 
len ratingone  I have come across issues that simply aren t being addressed by google in the least 
len ratingone It would help if I could actually speak to someone apparently that s impossible 
len ratingone It s not my fault somebody changed some passwords and have their email on as my recovery email Nine years of heavy use on my account but because the recovery email isn t mine to verify my account nothing i say or do has valor 
len ratingone only they can check the recovery email address and only they can verify me 
len ratingone Months of this bs not even a reply which I can t remember the last time i received one it s been so long 
len ratingone Every time I see an update pop up I excitedly hope it s a removal fix for what was forced out 
len ratingone Or at the very least a response to all the complaints would be nice with a message that rollbacks actual improvements are coming 
len ratingone Please revert this Safari copycat 
len ratingone PLEASE 
len ratingone Again if we wanted to be using Safari we would been doing so already 
len ratingone Well officially uninstalling 
len ratingone Tired of waiting for a revert fix to this failure of a new UI 
len ratingone Just checking back again to see if this mistake has been reverted fixed 
len ratingone It s almost unbelievable that they are really digging in their heels and sticking with this version of what WAS a once really great browser 
len ratingone Not sure if iOS or chrome 
len ratingone Don t care 
len ratingone Click in text box can t see what I m typing after last update 
len ratingone Don t really care who s fault it is 
len ratingone Can t install android on my iPhone so make it work or lose the iOS market I suppose 
len ratingthree I really don t appreciate the new look that makes functionality more like Safari that s why I use chrome on my iPhone to begin with to get away from Safari 
len ratingone I want to watch NYSTV and google u tube will not let me 
len ratingone Dont know why 
len ratingtwo I recently updated the app and now I can t log in to my school website it locks me out and I never had problems with it before Aren t updates supposed to be helpful 
len ratingone The problem with the translation of the page into another language hangs and does not respond to the touch of the screen 
len ratingone Please correct please 
len ratingone Thanks you
len ratingfive Last update states I can add a search engine like DuckDuckGo 
len ratingfive Exactly how do I do this 
len ratingfive The apps up to date 
len ratingfive I m running current software on my phone 
len ratingfive And I ve dug through all the settings and see no way to perform this 
len ratingfive What the heck is going on 
len ratingone I don t know why every app uses this style now 
len ratingone It brings tears to my eyes please bring old UI back 
len ratingone Why would anyone use google chrome on iOS 
len ratingone This is a marketing advertising data collection tool first then a decent web browser 
len ratingone Id recommend Safari for more privacy and a better experience 
len ratingone Too many bugs 
len ratingone It s slow I m having all kinds of issues with google maps and the new tab design is just annoying 
len ratingone You should at least give us the option to pick which version we want 
len ratingone I like the old google 
len ratingone You know the version that wasn t Safari 
len ratingfour It needs a systemwide dark mode 
len ratingfour It s almost a no brainer at this point 
len ratingfour Most Chrome competitors have one and personally I ve been considering switching over because of it 
len ratingfour Please make me stay 
len ratingone The last update keeps crashing every time I open it 
len ratingfive  Downloaded
len ratingthree Whenever I try to search something the app crashes 
len ratingfour With the most recent update I ve found chrome crashing more often than before 
len ratingfour Random black screens cause me to restart the app 
len ratingfour Kinda annoying would look into it 
len ratingfive I can t update anything out of apps due to my sons father having everything in his name and every time I put my debit card in its denied due to his billing account 
len ratingfive He used to have his credit card in my phone so I could have iTunes however he s taken everything away so I have no credit card to update my apps and he s not going to help me
len ratingtwo There is no bookmarks bar option so that I can INSTANTLY access my favorite sites with the single tap of a icon 
len ratingtwo So 
len ratingtwo I went with Safari 
len ratingtwo It is the only browser I ve come across that gives such a simple albeit powerful feature 
len ratingtwo Fix this and then I ll finally be able use my original favorite browser 
len ratingfive  I porn
len ratingone I downloaded Chrome a long time ago but Google doesn t seem to know it 
len ratingone I even have the Chrome symbol on my computer but it still asks me every time to download it 
len ratingone I am really sick of Google 
len ratingthree New comment I am attempting to see if my VPN or possibly the AMP page ability is a potential cause of this issue 
len ratingthree Previously Find function broken 
len ratingthree It cannot even find words that I Copy from your Browser and Paste into your Find field 
len ratingthree Words which are in front of my eyes on your Browser 
len ratingone  It s weird to say but this version of Google Chrome made me unhappy 
len ratingone The previous version of it was really great there were no lags and bugs it rarely stopped or malfunctioned but this version isn t that great 
len ratingone I was using an older version of it I can t remember which one it was that was awesome in any way 
len ratingone I recently updated it as I reseted my iPhone but thought it would have been great ignoring the reviews I reinstalled it and alas 
len ratingone They were saying the truth 
len ratingone The previous version was great it was smooth one could jump between tabs much more easily there was a refresh button at the top now we have to scroll all the way up to refresh a page no more saving images 
len ratingone It looks more like SAFARI now 
len ratingone The bigger tabs just makes it more messy 
len ratingone Just changing the interface doesn t gonna help it is a clear sign they are just copying other browser s stuff 
len ratingone I really wish there was a way you can download previous versions on iOS 
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingfour This is an IOS issue but nonetheless it turns out if you close an app the phone keeps memory of the last image that was showing for that particular app basically like a screenshot of the website that shows in the app drawer 
len ratingfour So if you were looking at something on Chrome that you didn t want anyone else to know about even if you were incognito 
len ratingfour they will see what you were last looking at 
len ratingfour It also is dependent on the orientation of the screen different previews are stored for landscape and portrait orientation 
len ratingfour Avoid potentially awkward or embarrassing situations and be sure to close those tabs people 
len ratingtwo I sent this report and issue multiple times and still nothing was fixed 
len ratingtwo Because of this new unneeded updates or one of them every image that I saved ended in my collections keep showing with a That s all we know message 
len ratingtwo This is just pitiful 
len ratingtwo I ve done nothing to my domain nothing with the URL 
len ratingtwo Nothing 
len ratingtwo All my image collection keeps showing up as a even the new ones that I literally just added 
len ratingtwo Fix the problem 
len ratingtwo It will only let me fully view pictures in my collection if I request the full site and not the mobile site 
len ratingtwo I don t want to use that every time I want to look at the collection of images I saved 
len ratingtwo It s hard enough using a full site on a mobile iPhone 
len ratingtwo Fix the problem 
len ratingone Still crashing and when it crashes it loses all my tabs 
len ratingthree If text fields appear at the bottom of the page when you select them the keyboard pops up and obscures the field so you cannot see what you re typing 
len ratingfive It s great but it would be cool if you could add an option in settings to disable the home bar on iPhone X XS and XR 
len ratingtwo If I wanted a Safari interface I d be using Safari 
len ratingtwo I m not sure why the UI has now adopted an a layout similar to Apples browser with the navigation pushed to the bottom of the screen and menu links in bright blue but I m not a fan 
len ratingone Today s update broke opening links from apps such as Apollo for Reddit 
len ratingone Won t open bookmarks anymore either 
len ratingone Basically useless now
len ratingtwo You can t access saved images on your collections because every time you try to open a saved image in the collection you get a page that the url didn t connect for no reason 
len ratingtwo This is a very bad inconvenience
len ratingone the only reason i downloaded was in the hope of using some of the extensions but nope not an option so for me it is a useless app
len ratingone Unsubscribe me I did not understand things about this and don t want it 
len ratingone Poorly written instructions to add other search providers 
len ratingone Feature doesn t work 
len ratingone Tried adding Duckduckgo no way to add search engines 
len ratingfive Really cool app 
len ratingfive Please made it for Apple Tv tooo
len ratingone You need do a better job of showing recently closed tabs 
len ratingone This is terrible 
len ratingfour WE NEED FLASH PLAYER PLEASE 
len ratingfive  Many people complain about Google but it s the safest browser for sure 
len ratingfive The tracking part of google comes in handy when using google maps as a gps to go places google is extremely updated when it comes to web searches 
len ratingfive You can turn off many settings to be more private too 
len ratingfive As long as you are not doing anything illegal on the internet who cares if they watch you go to the bathroom lol 
len ratingone  Will not retain username domain plus password for work same for Google while Edge and Safari boot right up 
len ratingone I never use this app 
len ratingthree When you open images in its own tab i e opening the full quality version there is no way to save it 
len ratingthree I m forced to open it in Safari to save it 
len ratingthree That s the only downside 
len ratingfive Not on hold long 
len ratingfive Quick answer to a question 
len ratingfive Courteous professional answer 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingthree  Periodically app will crash and tabs will be lost 
len ratingthree I m not aware that recent versions have any failsafe mechanisms but I m hoping this becomes an option 
len ratingone Google s privacy policy stinks 
len ratingone Unfortunate because I enjoyed Chrome 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome 
len ratingone I always hated it when an app opened Safari by default on my iPhone 
len ratingone And now the new chrome update is like an imitation Safari browser except worse 
len ratingone All of the open tabs used to be pretty compact and I could scroll through them quickly now each tab takes up a chunk of screen space and takes forever to scroll through 
len ratingone Also I don t think the back button and menu button needed to be moved to the bottom bar 
len ratingone It was more efficient to do all of my clicking along the top of my screen back button search bar tabs menu etc 
len ratingone It looks pretty bad right now 
len ratingone Please change it 
len ratingtwo When I search some websites or other things or to do research it will say website can not be reached 
len ratingtwo Why I would like it to STOP 
len ratingtwo Is it the WiFi 
len ratingtwo I don t know but please get it fixed 
len ratingtwo It is not restrictions 
len ratingtwo For example say I search up a pair of shoes or a car and it will say website can not be reached 
len ratingtwo Please fix this if it is not the WiFi 
len ratingone Chrome crashes every couple weeks 
len ratingone When it s launched again it gives you the option to restore the open tabs 
len ratingone Then it crashes again during the restore process 
len ratingone Launching it once again all your tabs are gone and unrecoverable 
len ratingone Needless to say don t use this browser for anything important 
len ratingone Keeps crashingb
len ratingtwo annoying as hell to us now
len ratingone Can t stand the way everything looks now and how it s all been rearranged 
len ratingone Deleting and looking for a new browsing app 
len ratingfive just needs full screen mode or something close
len ratingone Stop updating 
len ratingone Go back years and I will use it again 
len ratingone There is a old saying by a very wise person 
len ratingone IF IT S NOT BROKEN DON T FIX IT 
len ratingone  AS FOR THIS APP IF IT IS WORKING OKAY LEAVE IT ALONE 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT 
len ratingthree Constant freeze crash since updated last 
len ratingthree Always liked it before 
len ratingthree Issue on both iPad and iPhone 
len ratingfive  I masterate with this
len ratingfive  I love it so much
len ratingone This is the last straw 
len ratingone I m going to do to google what I did to Facebook 
len ratingone Move all my accounts and find other services 
len ratingfour I love using Chrome and use it over Safari all the time but the auto fill function on this app really needs to be overhauled 
len ratingone I have an iPhone eight and I cannot get chrome to operate on my phone 
len ratingone It just keeps saying to download it 
len ratingone I download it it open it won t let me search or do anything it just repeats it self showing all the great things that can do with videos but won t let me do because it says download Chrome so I go to the App Store again and it shows it s already downloaded and the icon is on my phone and I have reset my phone and it still does not work 
len ratingone Back to Safari or the plain Google app I guess 
len ratingtwo I deleted this app after my phone said it was using my battery 
len ratingtwo Not sure why might be a security problem but I deleted it to be safe 
len ratingone  Why won t it let me download this app 
len ratingone Is There is something wrong with this 
len ratingone The new update that totally changed the UI made it easy for me to decide to delete and switch to something that won t track me and force me to login 
len ratingone Esta actualizaci n tiene muy buena presentaci n pero tiene problemas constantemente me esta poniendo el traductor la misma p gina solo cambio la foto de un carro que no tiene letras y contin a con ese problema por favor una actualizaci n resolviendo eso
len ratingone Hate the UI changes 
len ratingone Please change back or allow me to use another version of chrome 
len ratingone I loved the way it looked before 
len ratingone I use chrome for a reason and that s because it simply was better 
len ratingone Now it s just a trashy safari clone 
len ratingfive  You can ask google anything 
len ratingfive Just take a minute sometimes to find the words 
len ratingfive Use comma s and parentheses instead of entire phrases 
len ratingfive Simplify it and even use in combination with each other 
len ratingfive An isolated sentence google 
len ratingfive See 
len ratingfive I often find myself in my own rabbit hole of extremely interesting and very valuable info tools 
len ratingfive I love this app very helpful and amazing I just love it I m amazed 
len ratingone  I WANT TO BEAT MY MEAT TO SOME SPICY PORN AND UR NOT EVEN DOWNLOADING
len ratingtwo All my tabs closed out on me for no reason 
len ratingtwo I can t recall many times it done this to me 
len ratingtwo Going into history and selecting tabs one by one takes to much time 
len ratingtwo  I had a lot of tabs open and now they re gone Please fix this 
len ratingfive  WHATTTTT YOU CAN GET GOOGLE CHROME ON HER EGEHE ALSO I WONDE RIF ITST THE BORSWER SCHCIIE TO OETYOUE R DOWNALOD ER ROMS CUZ YEHA E RSAFIRAI AIN T ER WORKIG WID THATS EHEH WHER EHT EUH E RDOOWLANLAODING 
len ratingfive HTTON AT EHE IS THATD THE UHHHHHHHHHHHH OS CHOICE YK BUT YEHANAHEM YK LGI 
len ratingfive Also WYAH also EYHA e drive stars cuz I love google chrome BRUHT he layout and YEHA 
len ratingfive Wow bruh yk lgi 
len ratingfive It is great for homework 
len ratingfive Especially with homework in middle school
len ratingone I like using google chrome but recently it changed to incognito and I hated 
len ratingone I tried changing it to regular chrome search but there are no options to change so I tried contacting google support and it just not helpful and I get rd party techs that want to charge to help 
len ratingone Unacceptable and I rather use other web search before I give my money away 
len ratingone There should be an easy option change to the reg chrome 
len ratingfive  I like how I can make it so no one can see my windows when I watch porn
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive Great search engine and I like the app but I don t like the newest update 
len ratingfive I liked the old screen better but 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Nothing wrong and always fast and efficient 
len ratingfive It also has heart and work in it 
len ratingfive Again Love IT 
len ratingtwo  Yea 
len ratingtwo I m not a fan 
len ratingtwo I have accounts and passwords all over been trying to let you know for years since I saw a chromium developer literally setting off depth charges 
len ratingtwo Idk wat that is Han Tran was his name password nightmares different log on screens 
len ratingtwo I would completely not use your stuff but unfortunately your kind of like a utility now 
len ratingtwo  There is still no way to OPT OUT of the the AMP feature in Chrome that automatically redirect all websites to the Google server with the excuse of accelerating the website download on slow connections and reducing ads this excuse is false as it does too on super fast fiber optic connections as ours is and then google insert its own ads 
len ratingtwo This Google chrome feature is also 
len ratingtwo Intrusive and against privacy 
len ratingtwo It disables the cool iOS feature of tapping the time on long websites to go quickly to the top 
len ratingtwo While attempting to copy the link of the website you will be force to always have the word google mixed with it in a longer strings 
len ratingtwo It disables the zoom or expand feature 
len ratingtwo It disables the view of comments at end of the news webpages WE THE COMMUNITY OF USERS ASK GOOGLE CHROME TO GIVE US THE OPTION TO DISABLE the AMP feature GLOBALLY for all websites in the Chrome global SETTINGS 
len ratingtwo  Some are preparing a class action lawsuit is this is not accomplished by google because the most nasty part of AMP is this AMP articles may not be from the original publication or the most authoritative source 
len ratingtwo AMP prioritizes adopters of AMP technology and popularity downgrading primary authoritative sources in the process 
len ratingthree The close all feature is pretty useful but I accidentally hit it every now and again and it doesn t even prompt with the confirmation that you want to close all unlike most browsers 
len ratingthree If you have multiple tabs open it doesn t default to the tabs around the tab you have open meaning you have to swipe until it lines up with the tabs you have opened
len ratingone A lot 
len ratingone Every time i go to a site with an image it crashes within a minute 
len ratingone Kinda useless now 
len ratingone Tried reinstalling and no fix
len ratingfive Truly dedicated to elevating your personal health care 
len ratingfive I am enjoying having Dr Misty White giving me the time and working with me to help achieve my health goals and being able to see the progress we have made in the time we have had together 
len ratingfive And yes I would higher recommend her to friends 
len ratingfive Show me how to use this new phenomenon
len ratingfive The improvement is nice but what most people do not realize is that in IOS every browser is safari running in the background 
len ratingone Stop working with communists who massacre their own people and maybe you ll get a good review 
len ratingone You censoring swamp donkeys you re lucky I ain t Vinnie Cannoli otherwise I woulda just said I ll make make sure Dey put all your pieces in the same coffin google 
len ratingfive  Google is my favorite app on earth it s great app I love it 
len ratingfive i love u chrome 
len ratingthree It won t load one of those sites I always use yet a different app will
len ratingtwo Why does chrome not support K streaming on its iOS app 
len ratingone Google is pushing AMP hard 
len ratingone I never want AMP formatted pages ever 
len ratingone Especially not on an iPad 
len ratingone All of the default links are AMP links and the request desktop site option hasn t worked on any of them 
len ratingone Same issue in the Google app 
len ratingfive  I booked a room at another hotel in town and it was disgusting so I called the Quality Inn 
len ratingfive I spoke to David who was extremely nice and welcoming 
len ratingfive The rooms are very clean and nice and the staff is outstanding 
len ratingfive The Hotel Manager seems to lead by example and the staff enjoys working for him 
len ratingfive I have to come back to Richmond soon and there is no doubt I will stay at the Quality Inn 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this hotel 
len ratingfive  Your mom
len ratingfour I love this app but I wish you could install chrome extensions like I do on my PC 
len ratingfour Please 
len ratingfour Install 
len ratingfour Extensions 
len ratingone Unfortunately the new overhaul of the software layout for new Chrome app doesn t work for me 
len ratingone It has become extremely confusing and it s hard for me to navigate through the Tabs 
len ratingone It should be simple but for me the Layout doesn t work 
len ratingone Sorry switching back to safari after years of using chrome 
len ratingone This makes me sad as I would much rather use Chrome 
len ratingone I guess they are paying google to show ads
len ratingone The new design is repulsive 
len ratingone Switching to a different browser 
len ratingfour  but has a hard time recognizing when I stop talking in a crowded area 
len ratingfour I wish you could tap the screen to have it stop listening and begin the search 
len ratingfive I have iPhone s since the last IOS update 
len ratingfive the last couple of weeks my safari browser isn t working right 
len ratingfive It doesn t want to load webpages unless I hit the go button again or refresh 
len ratingfive So I m using chrome a lot of the time 
len ratingfive Chrome is a fast browser 
len ratingfive I do recommend Chrome 
len ratingtwo The new design just changed chrome around to be like safari 
len ratingtwo I hated safari the back arrow is on the bottom of the screen now and I have to slide the screen to go back to prior sites 
len ratingtwo It s annoying don t be like Safari go back to chrome 
len ratingone I like the part where I am in incognito mode and click a YouTube link and it LAUNCHES THE YOUTUBE APP WITH ME LOGGED IN 
len ratingone What were you thinking Google 
len ratingone  Way to change a layout that loyal users have been using forever all so you can rip off apple s terrible designs 
len ratingone To fix Put this in your url box chrome flags ui refresh phase Set to disabled Now the fix is disabled 
len ratingfive  LIKE MY NEW SONG COMING IN FEBRUARY 
len ratingthree  I get that a competitor that offers privacy makes Google scared but that s not reason to block the option 
len ratingthree Give us DuckDuckGo 
len ratingfour Chrome is a great app just wish you didn t need the internet 
len ratingthree Love Google but lately when getting directions to anywhere within a mile radius it been saying the trip takes hours or more when the town is miles away
len ratingone This is the at least th time that this app has closed ALL my tabs 
len ratingone I am so mad 
len ratingone I had some important stuff up and now it s just all gone 
len ratingtwo The swipe left or right to close tabs was a lot more convenient 
len ratingfive Great company
len ratingfive  This is amazing and you can do a lot of stuff plz download this NOW 
len ratingone Glide typing hasn t worked in the chrome app at all and every time I open the app the emoji keyboard is the one that comes up no matter what my settings are set to 
len ratingone Get you crap together Google 
len ratingone What s with established and perfect apps suddenly changing everything about themselves 
len ratingone I use chrome because it s user friendly and looks so sleek 
len ratingone Now 
len ratingone Not at all 
len ratingone I feel like I m looking at a children s toy phone 
len ratingone Please change back 
len ratingtwo It s always crashing 
len ratingtwo What s up w that 
len ratingfive I use this almost everyday I dont know what I d do without it 
len ratingone Ok so the first time I used this app it took me to this website that was stole my password and money I lost dollars of my account 
len ratingone P S make it better or I will use Firefox
len ratingone Chrome stinks on IOS now 
len ratingone It used to be the best now nearly unuseable 
len ratingfive I got hit by a bus using fire fox in school
len ratingfour This will probably never happen
len ratingtwo Whenever I want to save a PDF to my files I am supposed to be able to click Open In and then transfer the pdf 
len ratingtwo However when I click that button all it does is vanish and I can no longer print the page to save it 
len ratingtwo Really irritating experience 
len ratingfour  I like it but would want a Homepage button like old chrome 
len ratingfour Be able to set my default website 
len ratingfour very convenient
len ratingone I m not impressed with the new layout of the tabs 
len ratingfive This is a very responsive and well made app 
len ratingfive I can t say anything else but good job creators 
len ratingthree Is there a way to Add a Link to your Homepage from Chrome 
len ratingthree  Add to Homepage isn t a Share option for me 
len ratingthree Don t want to swap to Safari for my browser 
len ratingone Every site I visit says connection not private useless 
len ratingfive  Great service and great food 
len ratingfive Delivery is always fast and efficient and the delivery drivers are always cheerful
len ratingone  Still no cookie controls 
len ratingone Cannot block cookies on iOS version 
len ratingone Spy browser 
len ratingone Android version allows user to block cookies 
len ratingone Sell your location browser data to marketers No cookie blocking 
len ratingone Use Safari or Opera browsers Samsung browser
len ratingone This app is so bad omg I can not even talk
len ratingone Completely foul 
len ratingone Chrome you were so good for so long but now you look like safari disappointed
len ratingfive This is so good it gives me the right thing I need
len ratingfive Great for searching recommend to everyone 
len ratingfour You probably don t need this because you can use Safari 
len ratingthree Design is better now but why it doesn t have D Touch feature 
len ratingthree Safari have D Touch feature to preview the page that I want to see 
len ratingthree It s annoying to can t use D Touch in Chrome 
len ratingthree And one more thing 
len ratingthree In Safari when I touch the address bar it shows me bookmarks so I can go straight into that site 
len ratingthree Please add that feature 
len ratingfour  Does its job
len ratingtwo Updated Jan the bars along the top and bottom the one along the top never goes away are still quite annoying 
len ratingtwo I still really only enjoy tab reorganizing in the current version 
len ratingtwo I prefer chrome over safari but I do not like the new design update 
len ratingtwo The bottom toolbar takes up too much of the screen and is unnecessary 
len ratingtwo If the I could go back to the previous version I would 
len ratingtwo The ability to reorder tabs is nice but I can t enjoy it with everything else 
len ratingone  Chrome has gone from my favorite browser in iOS to the biggest disappointment on the app store 
len ratingone The recent interface overhaul is clunky browsing is slower tab management is unnecessarily cumbersome and simple things that set it apart previously such as button placement have almost entirely changed 
len ratingone Now it s just a slow Safari clone with worse features 
len ratingone I submitted similar feedback via the app but received no response there used to be a way to revert to the old interface but that was recently removed 
len ratingone Really unfortunate to see this app fall apart so greatly 
len ratingone Sad to say it s no longer my default browser 
len ratingone I ve been having issues opening linked pages on this version of chrome it keeps saying server not found while safari opens it without hesitation
len ratingone Bad
len ratingone Prior to the last update Chrome was my go to on IOS devices 
len ratingone Now it seems that it randomly crashes behind the scenes and loses all of my tabs on my phone browser 
len ratingone Frustrating to say the least 
len ratingone Please fix and I will gladly give star rating as I love the browser itself 
len ratingtwo I love the new update 
len ratingtwo One change I would suggest is moving the website entry field to the very top of the keyboard like the format used in iMessage 
len ratingtwo This would allow for easier editing of mistakes 
len ratingtwo With larger screens it can be difficult to reach to the top and select an area you wish to edit 
len ratingthree i along with many other people would like to see better support on downloading pdfs into notability
len ratingtwo  It s frustrating when you search for something Google click a result and then hit the back button 
len ratingtwo It returns you to the top of the screen list rather than the same position within the list of results 
len ratingtwo It s odd that they would have it work that way 
len ratingtwo Doesn t make sense 
len ratingone  All you have here is a mediocre browser unless this app starts supporting extensions like the windows and Mac version 
len ratingone It should be more like the Mac version 
len ratingone Highly disappointed 
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingfive  Amazing 
len ratingfive  Big Chungus eats big fungus
len ratingone I like Chrome even the new version in the abstract 
len ratingone It s a solid browser highly standards compliant 
len ratingone But I know if I use it especially if I log into my Google account my privacy is gone 
len ratingone I understand why some are willing to make the trade off 
len ratingone If you go all in with the Google world the various bits integrate well 
len ratingone And maybe privacy is just an abstract concept to some 
len ratingone But it s not to me 
len ratingone Google used to say Don t be evil i e like Microsoft 
len ratingone That ship sailed long ago 
len ratingone So I ll keep using Firefox 
len ratingone They have their issues but compiling a complete dossier on my browsing habits and my life isn t one of them 
len ratingone i dont know my trip i wait to long but i dont get the my trip and i lost for what 
len ratingone stupid uber
len ratingone When a webpage refreshes by itself it sends you back to the top 
len ratingone Didn t seem to do this in the past 
len ratingone You would be left in the same spot previously 
len ratingone  Bookmarks are not syncing 
len ratingtwo Please add the download manager to this application Thank you
len ratingfive  The new design is stunningly beautiful 
len ratingfive Good job SWEs 
len ratingfive  Yeah
len ratingfive  Best browser for the iPhone bar none 
len ratingfive The cloud storage of my settings and bookmarks is nice too 
len ratingfive One HUGE suggestion for the devs Any pop up must have at least TWO options 
len ratingfive This stops there from being pesky pop ups that only show Ok and force you to go to a malicious website 
len ratingfive An alternative option is not locking out the tabs button when a pop up comes up 
len ratingone One of the key features of any web browser is having a bookmarks bar to quickly access all your go to websites 
len ratingone It has been on Safari for iPad for ages and Chrome still doesn t have it 
len ratingone  Safari browser goes into Aw Snap error repeatedly 
len ratingone Shutdown incognito mode or reload doesn t help 
len ratingone junk
len ratingtwo  I ve switched from Android to iPhone off and on and on iPhone I always use Chrome 
len ratingtwo But over the past few weeks every time I open Chrome I get a popup saying I won something from Amazon or I have a virus etc 
len ratingtwo I have deleted the app reinstalled I have deleted history I have done every trick on the internet 
len ratingtwo I do not have a virus on my phone it has not been jailbroken so I m guessing it s a Chrome issue with Apple 
len ratingtwo I have just decided to delete the app permanently which is sad because I like the ease of navigation much better than safari 
len ratingthree Google really needs to do better at blocking malware pop ups that are now coming off mainstream sites like CNN msn etc it reminds me of all the ad popup days be better
len ratingthree Still doesn t have a Menu 
len ratingthree Why don t you add as one of the things on the dots 
len ratingone Latest version freezes on language translation 
len ratingone  WOT
len ratingfour I do most of my mobile browsing using incognito mode 
len ratingfour Would be great to eliminate those extra clicks 
len ratingone Making it really hard to enjoy the google ecosystem without chromecast compatibility 
len ratingone I got an Apple TV for Christmas and won t be using my chromecast again 
len ratingone Terrible app for iPhone X sideways view is impossible to use easily fixable but Google obviously doesn t care
len ratingone There s no cancel refresh button for a browser 
len ratingone Every browser does 
len ratingone The touch experience is not fine tuned and it s just poor 
len ratingone Most importantly network WiFi is always spinning meaning it s constantly transferring stuff even while just reading a page Unbelievable 
len ratingtwo No way to save an image currently 
len ratingtwo Long press yeilds no download options
len ratingone HATE the new update 
len ratingone It looks exactly like safari and there was a reason I never used safari 
len ratingone PLEASE BRING BACK OLD FORMAT 
len ratingfour  Smh
len ratingfive  I love google chrome because I can use Pinterest and whatever other site on it 
len ratingfive Love markers wish were cheaper but good choice when you are looking for shading and coloring 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone Not secure at all 
len ratingone Lots of congratulations pop ups and no one way of getting rid of them after clearing browsing history 
len ratingone What a pain 
len ratingone Since the newest update I m getting ADS and more ADS 
len ratingone On the top of the screen coming down about an INCH into my viewing area and guess what 
len ratingone I ve been mattress shopping so every one of those ads are MATTRESS ADS 
len ratingone Getting rid of chrome after using it since its inception 
len ratingone GOODBYE CHROME 
len ratingone I don t want my toolbar at the bottom of he screen 
len ratingone I hate it like that in safari which is the primary reason I don t use safari 
len ratingone now chrome has decided to copy them and there is no way I can find to change it back any more 
len ratingone It is ridiculous in this day and age that I don t have the option of keeping the UI the way I like it yet google thinks they can dictate to us what we will like and if you don t like it then too bad 
len ratingone not only do I not like the layout I think the redesign is ugly and blocky too 
len ratingone this used to be my favorite browser but I will be looking for something else now 
len ratingone  Please tell me what I m talking about you can call me please call aunt grandma grandpa she got her grandma call me she can come over tonight please tell her she gets upset about you guys please call me please
len ratingfive Big chungus
len ratingtwo So I m a HUGE google supporter 
len ratingtwo HAVING SAID THAT the mobile app IS NOT THE SAME as the desktop 
len ratingtwo For example on the desktop version you have a home button not on the mobile app 
len ratingtwo Another example you can customize your google home page with themes lots and lots and LOTS of really cool themes not on the mobile app 
len ratingtwo I was under the impression that the mobile app was supposed to be an extension of the desktop 
len ratingtwo You know to like go from the desktop to the phone kind of thing 
len ratingtwo But if you can t even set up the mobile app to function and look like your desktop home page then what s the point 
len ratingtwo Sorry Google I can t support that NO MATTER HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU 
len ratingfour Wish you could cast tab to Chromecast in the same way you can do it from a computer 
len ratingfour Would make life much easier
len ratingthree Crap 
len ratingthree YouTube videos play x faster when I do nothing 
len ratingfour I really like this app but the only problem is that google does not allow you to change your background on an ipad or iphone and it also has an ugly update that i really hate so if u people agree with me than please put a if you agree with me 
len ratingfour Thank you google
len ratingfive You can just search whatever you want and it s Bette than safari
len ratingone  Blah blah blah blah I like potato blah blah
len ratingfour  Didn t
len ratingfive This is one of the few browsers I use and I just think it is the best I use for porn
len ratingthree The Android version of Chrome has more features and is designed perfect 
len ratingthree I do not see a home button or an option to create a homepage on iOS 
len ratingone This looks unfinished 
len ratingone I don t want the path to be hidden in the url 
len ratingone How do I turn that crap off 
len ratingone Where s are the rest of the settings 
len ratingone  There s no option of blocking ads 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Until I can use content blockers like in Safari no way 
len ratingone Just deleted 
len ratingone Will check back in months 
len ratingone I have ALWAYS loved and counted on Google Chrome with searching whatever whenever 
len ratingone However now that it has been updated and it is no longer available to zoom in or out to be able to access the information on whatever the user might actually need to access from the webpage that he she has opened up and tried to view 
len ratingone It is definitely very much frustrating when the webpage has something that is vitally important on it and the user cannot access parts of the webpage that is needed to access in order to do whatever it is the user might have to do especially when they are not able to get access to a computer or tablet and have to use a phone or an iPhone to do the specific task that they would have easily been able to do before this app was updated 
len ratingone I have had to download several different apps just to find one that is exactly how Google Chrome used to be in order to be able to do something that I would have been able to do less than a few minutes 
len ratingone I really wish that the developers could bring back the original Google Chrome app that was designed to help and make life a lot easier for doing certain tasks that are necessary and needed to do 
len ratingone I am still sifting through the web browser apps just to find one that is up to par and easy to use like Google Chrome was before it was updated and the options for zooming in and out and fixing the webpage to the users specifications and needs 
len ratingone Please bring back the Chrome that so many users loved and were able to use before all the updates and the settings options were taken away from us 
len ratingone You know deep down inside that google is evil 
len ratingone Stay away 
len ratingtwo I didn t happened before
len ratingone It crashed my WiFi and I spent about hours trying to access my email though I had access passwords written done and sent phone number several times 
len ratingone I reinstalled and encountered the same problems 
len ratingone What is google s problem 
len ratingone Not worth the hassle when it does not consistently work 
len ratingthree Well I haven t used the app yet but by the reviews I can tell that it s out of a so it s good Ig
len ratingone Hey maybe I ll just download Firefox because IT LOOKS MORE LIKE CHROME THAN CHROME DOES ANYMORE 
len ratingone WHAT WERE YOU IDIOTS THINKING 
len ratingtwo  The pillow was great for the first few days but gradually lost its shape and support 
len ratingtwo I still use it but not with the same expectancy
len ratingtwo I really wish that the old version of chrome was still allowed as an option 
len ratingtwo I used chrome flags top chrome md after a month and it was AMAZING to go back but it seems to have been completely removed now 
len ratingtwo I ll probably just stop using chrome because the UI changes are consistently getting worse with every version 
len ratingtwo Peak chrome seems to have been in or so 
len ratingone the new update is horrible go back to old version
len ratingone I hate the new mostly white UI for Google s apps 
len ratingone This game or whatever does not work 
len ratingfive  Great staff 
len ratingfive They are very patient with you make sure that you understand all the process 
len ratingfive Work fast with professionalism 
len ratingfive Definitely recommended to everyone 
len ratingfive I updated this app and all the controls are now on bottom of the screen 
len ratingfive Only problem is my screen is cracked at the bottom and the touchscreen doesn t function well 
len ratingfive I am REALLY regretting updating this app 
len ratingfive Please allow me the option to revert 
len ratingfive I love google chrome but it s unusable after update for me 
len ratingfive Easy to manage tabs
len ratingtwo Trying to find a new browser because I m assuming this is the design going forward no thanks
len ratingone The app is as worse as the search every time I go on the app my phone immediately starts to glitch it freezes and turns off get your goddamn glitch s together because of your app I had so many crashes update it for god sake
len ratingfive  Unable to download chrome someone is not letting me in my phone
len ratingthree  It is to salty and savory it might need some truffle oil to mask some of that heavy flavor but over all the butthole tasted good heudb
len ratingone  Bad service in front desk people there is not friendly and full trained the hotel charges for everything the worst part you don t know until you get your confirmation housekeeping person bother to much 
len ratingone Bathroom not confortable 
len ratingone If you are looking for a good hotel don t come to Delano 
len ratingone Said enough 
len ratingone Can t even use the app as the passwords I ha e saved have to be manually entered all of them What a joke
len ratingtwo Whenever I view a page that is multiple screens in length and need to scroll down the page disappears nothing is displayed regardless of how slowly you scroll 
len ratingtwo Then when scrolling back up the display disappears again 
len ratingtwo It makes reading almost any web page with more than one screen useless 
len ratingthree This would be my go too but it has some problems 
len ratingthree It is a great Browser but the tiles on the front page needs to go it makes it look cluttered and I would like to see it be fully filled for the new iPad Pro with no black bars 
len ratingthree If that could happen that is when i would recommend this 
len ratingthree For now I still never seen a better bowser but apples
len ratingone Chrome crashes all the time 
len ratingone Not good 
len ratingtwo this is the third time that i install chrome and then regret end remove it 
len ratingtwo i can not open downloaded pdfs in other apps what safari easily does and now i search in tab bar and get a blank page instead of results
len ratingtwo Latest update removes the option to reverse the horrible new redesign using chrome flags 
len ratingone Horrible interface 
len ratingone Deleted from my phone 
len ratingone The recent changes to the chrome user interface are pretty bad 
len ratingone They seem like they might be optimizing for blind people 
len ratingone The recent update serves as a good reminder to prioritize using a different browser 
len ratingone Reverse image search nowhere to be found
len ratingfive Why no themes 
len ratingtwo We re did the bookmarks bar go 
len ratingtwo This is very upsetting 
len ratingfour  Room is clean but the bath tub won t drain pile up water cover all my feet 
len ratingthree  The most recent update sacrifices the simple and familiar user interface in favor of being more like competing web browsing apps 
len ratingthree While I appreciate the drive towards standardization this was a mistake 
len ratingthree The new wide tabs display makes it much harder to navigate back and forth between a few tabs at a time and it seems like it takes longer to load as well 
len ratingthree I also really liked that Chrome had all of its controls along the top of the screen as opposed to split between top and bottom 
len ratingthree The new design puts far more clutter on the screen so it feels much more intrusive 
len ratingthree I wish there was a setting to return to the old interface 
len ratingthree The new layout and slower response of this version feels like a whole different app 
len ratingthree Since I will need to relearn the whole system anyway I think I will me switching my primary browser 
len ratingtwo This version keeps redirecting me to a psinet adware campaign 
len ratingtwo Will stop using for now 
len ratingfive  Fast response time courteous efficient and helpful service 
len ratingfive I will recommend highly to friends and family 
len ratingthree I just transitioned to iPhone from an Android device and I miss the Chrome browser experience from Android that was was clean smooth chrome like experience 
len ratingthree That s what I was hoping for with the iPhone app but it s not the same 
len ratingthree I feel like this is a Chrome Safari hybrid and I don t want that 
len ratingthree If I wanted Safari I would use Safari 
len ratingthree The buttons are clunky and dated slim them down and put them at the top of the browser app like in Android please 
len ratingone I totally loved the old chrome and honestly hadn t updated my phone in a little bit but didn t expect there to be THAT much different 
len ratingone The interface is completely different and so ugly 
len ratingone It looks so much like safari and I detest safari 
len ratingone I ve never made a review but this horrible design has pushed me to the edge 
len ratingone There may be good qualities with this update but who would really know 
len ratingone It s impossible to see past the trash layout 
len ratingtwo Chrome is my go to app because I frequently travel and like how Chrome will automatically translate webpages to English 
len ratingtwo But the notification that the translation has been done takes up almost half my screen 
len ratingtwo I acknowledge the notification but as soon as I start to scroll through the page the notification pops up again and again and again 
len ratingtwo I d put this rating at a if I can have the option to hide that notification 
len ratingtwo I don t need to be told the page has been translated to English I can see that as soon as I start reading 
len ratingone Autoplaying videos are a pestilence and chrome doors nothing to protect us from this scourge 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingone The new look looks more like safari and that s why I hate 
len ratingone I hated safari because of its appearance and choose chrome but not o don t really see the difference with the new chrome update 
len ratingone I really want it to go back like the previous chrome
len ratingone I cannot scroll down to view website 
len ratingone I have looked for answers does anyone know what i can do 
len ratingone My companies website will only run on chrome 
len ratingone Every time I go to a website seconds after opening it crashes and says Aw Snap I ve tried reloading it and using suggestions but non of them worked at all 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed It s nothing but Aw Snap
len ratingone There is absolutely no way to have my google stop saving my searches 
len ratingone There s no option for it on iPhone 
len ratingone Works fine on my android 
len ratingone Yes my web activity is all deactivated 
len ratingone It also doesn t apply whether I m logged into an account or as private 
len ratingone It s maddening 
len ratingone Someone solve this please 
len ratingone I know google makes money via ads but until now chrome felt like a platform designed by minimalist engineers who knew the whyq short socks Now the entire screen is cluttered and reading browsing is ridiculously covered in ads and pop up banners and google useless menu bars 
len ratingone I uninstalled and will be using safari
len ratingone what s the point of even having an app of your browser if you re not going to add reverse image search
len ratingfive  Rhmnjohn
len ratingone After update all my trust and convenience is lost from this update Not at happy with the update
len ratingone I touch and nothing dnt open
len ratingone Bravo now in addition to this new awful moronic and very awkward UI and tabs you have also removed the options in chrome flags to revert to the classical tabs and UI 
len ratingone Chrome v iOS 
len ratingone Are there any professionals left out there knowing what the Chrome team is doing 
len ratingone And yes I ll keep Chrome for minimum coordination of my Google accounts but for anything else I think it is time to evaluate the alternatives 
len ratingone So long 
len ratingfive Chrome or nothing
len ratingtwo My reason for installing this was to be able to cast videos like I do with Chrome on my laptop 
len ratingtwo If the feature is there I can t find it
len ratingone Doesn t let you use DuckDuckGo as a search engine 
len ratingone Goodbye 
len ratingone Needed to download this app to video chat my boyfriend 
len ratingone Once downloaded it says it you are using unsupported browser 
len ratingone I m not understanding 
len ratingone  Can we please fire the morons who keep screwing up what was one the best browser on iOS 
len ratingone What moron took a page out of the Fisher Price school of web design with the latest UI 
len ratingone Complete garbage and a waste of human space went into this crap 
len ratingone Won t even open now since the last update useless 
len ratingone Since they put in the close all tabs button there is no option to confirm so when swiping though tabs if your finger accidentally hits it every tab you have opened is gone 
len ratingone There needs to be a pop up box to confirm to close all tabs 
len ratingone I had tabs opened in order and all are gone now 
len ratingone This is garbage I was okay with it because you gave us the option to switch back to the old interface 
len ratingone But now we have no option but to have half the screen taken up by toolbars 
len ratingone It s intrusive and I really wish you would revert it back or at least give us the option 
len ratingthree  At school I love going to friv and stuff but now it s WAY to complicated so just a review
len ratingone Please give us the option to return to the old design 
len ratingone The new design is terrible 
len ratingone  Chrome went from too bar that contained everything to a top and bottom bar and it just looks terrible feels clustered and switching between tabs is a lot slower
len ratingthree This has been a very good app until today 
len ratingthree Before today when I downloaded the new update my bookmarks no longer opens on an entire web page with folders and everything 
len ratingthree Now they re all munged together and I LOATHE it 
len ratingthree Please change it back to the way it was before I downloaded the new update please 
len ratingthree Newer update the History is very irritating it s IMPOSSIBLE to delete anything in my history with one click like it s supposed to do 
len ratingthree I have to REPEAT the steps TWICE for anything in my History to disappear 
len ratingthree VERY frustrating after having to deal with this glitch for months on end 
len ratingtwo This new version is pretty bad 
len ratingtwo You made it like safari which all of your users hated and the whole reason we were using chrome to begin with 
len ratingtwo Was good before is now terrible you took more screen real estate and made it harder to get to things 
len ratingtwo I never write app reviews but felt obligated to try to warn other users 
len ratingtwo Skip this version 
len ratingtwo Chrome is great fast and renders web pages near perfection 
len ratingtwo But I have never seen an app completely drain my IPhone s battery as quickly as this 
len ratingtwo Google please try to make it more power efficient on IPhones 
len ratingfive  All other things considered 
len ratingone Can t set simple functions such as private browsing delete cookies or history 
len ratingone On a phone it s very jarring to see controls on the top and bottom as well as both changing as you scroll 
len ratingone Forcing this view is ergonomically atrocious
len ratingone They forgot to say no returns 
len ratingone Turns out no returns but credit but cost a lot to return then 
len ratingone I wear a 
len ratingone They sent 
len ratingone Fit more like 
len ratingone Be careful 
len ratingone Latest update breaks autofill 
len ratingone It shows up all the time and doesn t work at all 
len ratingone It covers up text input fields 
len ratingone And to top it off you can t disable it anymore 
len ratingone Google is always making anti user choices I m going back to Firefox on my iPad
len ratingfive Attentive and knowledgeable service 
len ratingfive Pleasant surroundings 
len ratingfive  Thank you for my coat 
len ratingfive It is in mint condition and I am enjoying wearing it 
len ratingfive Great price as well 
len ratingfive Thank you for taking out the shoulder pads 
len ratingfive I might need to have the shoulders adjusted 
len ratingfive But indeed it is well worth it and just a glamorous jet black mink coat 
len ratingfive Sincerely Prasialite
len ratingone This used to be my go to browser but after the design overhaul it just became too intolerable 
len ratingone I managed to keep it from contaminating my iPhone for a while but it finally got in somehow 
len ratingone The chrome flag for using the old aesthetic does not seem to exist on the iPhone 
len ratingone I don t understand why I can t just use the layout I prefer 
len ratingone If you like the new layout great but is it really that hard to let those of us who don t like the new layout continue using the old version 
len ratingone Just give us the option 
len ratingone No 
len ratingone Do not just change the ui like this 
len ratingone It is very unappealing to the eye and makes me sick 
len ratingone You will be losing a lot of users from this change alone 
len ratingone Your lucky that the review system here requires a star to submit any reviews 
len ratingone That is the only reason you re getting star instead of the like I would prefer 
len ratingone Change it back or give us back the option in flags 
len ratingone So ugly and now that there is now no work around to remove the new UI not worth the download 
len ratingone Update Two days later still trash 
len ratingfive I think this is a good app
len ratingone I used to use Chrome of the time but after they change the UI 
len ratingone I started using Safari Web Browser with its ability to create a PDF doc of a website 
len ratingone Google doesn t seem to offer much but to keep you signed in for their advertising purposes or revenue
len ratingone This doesn t have a cast button on browser
len ratingone  As the title says when I updated my phone s chrome last month I lost all my saved passwords 
len ratingone Needless to say I m super upset
len ratingone Give us an potion to back to the much better UI
len ratingfive Add keyboard
len ratingone I cant see what im typing on facebook 
len ratingone I cant scroll while the keyboard is opened
len ratingone Hate this app evil pop ups
len ratingfive  Awesome helped me a bunch and now I make dollars a day
len ratingtwo There is a noticeable delay when opening a new tab 
len ratingtwo Please fix this issue 
len ratingtwo The browser seems to be slower than before 
len ratingtwo Also could iPad Pro keyboard shortcuts be added for switching tabs 
len ratingtwo Safari has the command shift arrow keys to switch between tabs 
len ratingone This trend of changing things only for the sake of change drives me nuts 
len ratingone New design does not make it better or more functional for everyone 
len ratingone How about this 
len ratingone Instead of forcing everyone to have their tabs at the bottom or the top give us some Ui options 
len ratingone How long until they decide that tabs at the top work better and force everyone to have them back up there 
len ratingone Give us accessibility options 
len ratingone I ve been using chrome on PC for ten years and on iOS for as long as it s been available 
len ratingone But this updated UI is the worst thing ever 
len ratingone It s clunky and dumbed down and I hate how it looks and how it handles 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I d use safari 
len ratingone At least you used to be able to revert the UI but like a bunch of selfish devs google has removed that option 
len ratingone Seriously google give us the option to use the new or the old UI because this new one is absolute trash 
len ratingtwo  Does not sync with accounts properly and rarely autofills passwords and other information correctly 
len ratingone App has been updated to the latest version but no pop up menu shows when you Tap and Hold to save image in chrome browser is it really fixed 
len ratingtwo Eh I guess
len ratingone Get annoying message video paused continue watching leave control in the hands of users stop adding these annoying features 
len ratingfive  Perfect for PornHub
len ratingone Used to be my favorite browser
len ratingone Ok so I think that this app used to be so much better 
len ratingone The notifications don t do anything at all 
len ratingone And plus it s annoying because whenever go into a website or page it just tells me to download the app and doesn t let me do anything at all 
len ratingone Now I barely ever use this anymore and instead of it going to the cloud it should go to the trash 
len ratingthree When I click on the option to auto fill on websites i e 
len ratingthree filling in my name email phone number and address with the click of a button the keyboard glitches and I can t control anything on the app I either have to force close it or it force closes itself 
len ratingthree I lose my tabs both ways 
len ratingfive  I use chrome on my MacBook Pro and on my iPhone X and my iPad Pro it is the fastest and most reliable plus all of the options of keeping everything synced since I use google for tons of different things I also have chrome and google syncing with my iCloud which makes everything work so great together 
len ratingfive The extensions on the desktop version are really useful I just wish that they were available on the mobile versions as well
len ratingone  So ugly and now that there is now no work around to remove the new UI not worth the download 
len ratingthree H b
len ratingthree Like Vend D F D D F F F
len ratingfive Chrome is the best beacuse it was always the best for any device
len ratingone I was kinda bummed out knowing that I can t edit my google site 
len ratingone I thought my tablet was fully capable of doing so since it can practically program software 
len ratingfive  Better than safari
len ratingone Google officially killed the old look of Chrome 
len ratingone You used to be able to revert to the older and more functional layout by adjusting hidden flags 
len ratingone This was removed in the latest update and I really hate it 
len ratingone The new look makes everything too big 
len ratingone Finding tabs is actually harder and the new tab manager makes tabs not feel like web pages 
len ratingone Every time I open a new tab I almost hit the close all button which would be catastrophic 
len ratingone This looks closer to Safari than ever 
len ratingone If I wanted Safari I d just use it since it s already in my phone 
len ratingone Google should be setting themselves apart and pushing the standards and not following other tech companies 
len ratingone I also just don t understand why the new in look is flat graphics oversized buttons or icons and huge amounts of wasted whitespace 
len ratingone I have a large phone 
len ratingone I don t need help with giant menus and buttons that look like they were designed for a senior citizen who forgot their glasses 
len ratingone And what does Google have against labels on the bottom menu bar and in the tab switcher 
len ratingone Sometimes I like to read what I m about to select before I touch it 
len ratingone The one good thing is the compact menu 
len ratingone It s concise and reachable 
len ratingone Bring back the customizability that used to exist in software and let me choose how I make my own device look 
len ratingone I don t need to be forced into the user experience that you think I want 
len ratingone EDIT Oh wow 
len ratingone Firefox lets you swipe tabs to close along with other lost functions of the older version of Chrome we all loved combined with the few positives of Safari e g reader view 
len ratingone Firefox has controls centralized at the bottom even though I prefer the top this is much better than the weird top and bottom control layout Chrome has 
len ratingone Good bye Chrome I m happy with a new web browser now 
len ratingone EDIT it was possible to change back to the old layout via chrome flags until the most recent update so I kept it at stars for a while hoping that problems would be fixed 
len ratingone Now you re disabling that option forcing everyone on an iPhone to go with the new layout 
len ratingone Thanks for the good times but I ll give you one star and switch to Safari until I hear that controls are centralized at the top of the screen again instead of taking double real estate at both the top and bottom of the screen tab previews and groupings are practical again and locations of various functions make sense again you can view your bookmarks via but you can only add bookmarks by clicking the export icon 
len ratingone If I wanted something that looks pretty I d use Apple for everything 
len ratingone I wanted something functional which was Google s strong suit until this Pretty But Unintuitive And Impractical update 
len ratingone Now I m better off saving storage space on my phone by sticking to the default Safari 
len ratingone Never thought I d say that but here we are 
len ratingone Original review The new update is just a copy of Safari 
len ratingone In that case it makes more sense for me to save space on my phone by uninstalling Chrome and relying solely on Safari 
len ratingone Please move the toolbar back to the top of the window 
len ratingone Otherwise it s counterintuitive to move from the top of the screen to type a URL then the bottom of the screen to open a new tab 
len ratingone EDIT An addendum also moving from the top of the screen to add a bookmark then bottom of the screen to view the bookmark you just added 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone Are you trying to promote carpal tunnel 
len ratingfive YuicnkxbbxncZ zac cc 
len ratingfive C Cggzcvdxcc
len ratingtwo I hate the new update the old set up was way better for what I use the app for 
len ratingtwo This new design is inefficient and tedious
len ratingfive Good
len ratingthree Why there is no Cast option within Chrome Browser 
len ratingthree Can this be upgraded ASAP
len ratingtwo  This is super slow and it s just horrible I m sticking to safari
len ratingone The old version was way better new update makes it look like safari 
len ratingthree  I basically enjoyed the cruise 
len ratingthree But I picked up an eye allergy while there and I m now suffering from that 
len ratingthree  The deduction of money from my account that I did not spend for whatever reason has caused a hardship on me 
len ratingthree That part I truly do not care for 
len ratingthree The food in the dining room on deck five left a lot to be desired 
len ratingthree The salmon was not seasoned well and the French onion soup was watery 
len ratingthree All other was ok Our cabin steward Irma Was the greatest 
len ratingthree I wish we had an iron in the room and a microwave This was my first cruise and I enjoyed it very much 
len ratingone  Lost all of my tabs after latest update 
len ratingfour I don t have a computer so I used to resort to Google Chrome the app to have me go into desktop mode on YouTube Studio 
len ratingfour But now it won t let me it just sits on a loading screen forever 
len ratingfour And yes I m aware of the YT Studio app but it doesn t have all the features I need to regularly upload a video 
len ratingone Not happy 
len ratingfour Can you guys set a offline mode for those pages that opened and when connection is off read those pages without network 
len ratingtwo I used google chrome because I HATE the look of Safari 
len ratingtwo Now Chrome looks like Safari 
len ratingtwo What the heck google 
len ratingtwo I liked having my tabs in the upper right corner to shuffle through 
len ratingtwo Honestly the old look was wayyyyyyyy more practical 
len ratingtwo Please bring it back 
len ratingfour Needs the ability to not open a tab in the current browser when being links from emails
len ratingtwo I wish there were better privacy setting like block ads and tracking and https everywhere 
len ratingtwo The amount of ads that slow down chrome is ridiculous and annoying 
len ratingone No Chromecast in browser for iPhones
len ratingfive  Cool app but it s really easy to use when all time comes back together to have some fun
len ratingone Many websites are super unstable on chrome for iOS 
len ratingone Most difficult e mail to sign into
len ratingfive It s a good app 
len ratingfive I think it works better than Safari 
len ratingfive Safari keeps crashing on me iOS so thank you for making this app 
len ratingfive Thanks Google REVIEWweekly
len ratingfive Very good 
len ratingthree When to close a tab its hard to reach the cross in the corner while using Xs plus 
len ratingthree A swipe to close feature is must needed for the users like me 
len ratingthree The browser is pretty same like safari now 
len ratingthree And now safari is better than chrome because of that feature 
len ratingfive Since I use my right thumb to tap the space bar I find that I type a period instead of a space quite often 
len ratingone  This app allows unwanted advertising to get in your browsing and most of them ate amazon ads 
len ratingone I feel that s criminal to force someone to follow you or don t go nowhere Now due to that kind of practice I m not searching the internet in my phone and I m thinking dropping my carrier and iPhone itself look for something better or nothing at all 
len ratingone Don t like at all 
len ratingone Want old version back
len ratingone New iPad downloaded Chrome as a matter of course and if I see Aw snap one more time I m gonna hurl 
len ratingone Totally bites 
len ratingone FIX IT FFS 
len ratingfive To be honest I never liked google design language choices and product anesthetics 
len ratingfive This version definitely got me 
len ratingfive This chrome version looks even better than the one in my other phone google pixel 
len ratingfive I never been able to settle in one browser 
len ratingfive I use edge safari and chrome 
len ratingfive With this update I think I can settle down with only one 
len ratingfive The only missing piece is Dark Mode 
len ratingone  Kindly keep your politics out of my searches 
len ratingone  Proud Independent
len ratingone  I had problems with my cousin and then he caught me cheating on my homework and he was about to tell my parents and the next day 
len ratingone Then I caught him with incognito looking at nudes and nutting to it Now I black mail him about it XDDDDDDD
len ratingone  Please fix ASAP
len ratingone They will bill your card three or four time a month without your permission my card has been cancelled numerous times because of it 
len ratingone They will charge you more if you don t check your card often with google apple and iTunes 
len ratingone They use apple to take your money iTunes should be free as much as you pay for the service 
len ratingfive  It is quicker than safari I also admire how chrome doesn t interfere with other things like safari does
len ratingthree What is the difference between the google app and google chrom 
len ratingfive  Still haven t used it yet but I think will be amazing
len ratingfour Is GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
len ratingone Chrome looks like safari 
len ratingone I can t even change the flag back since they removed the option 
len ratingone Terrible and horrible UI 
len ratingone Material redesign is garbage whoever designed the new UI should be fired 
len ratingone It was possible to disable this nightmare in chrome flags before the most recent update 
len ratingone It is no longer possible to avoid this hot garbage UI so you should avoid this garbage app 
len ratingone The latest update took a very stable and solid browser and turned it into something completely different 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingone Deleted it and won t be using Chrome on any of my mobile devices anymore 
len ratingthree This is awful why would you impair the browser this way 
len ratingthree I can no longer efficiently manage my tabs or swipe them away 
len ratingthree I now have an even smaller viewport due to core functions being moved to the bottom 
len ratingthree I can now see less of the URL because of the rounded corners on the URL bar 
len ratingfour I m satisfied with the Chrome layout and setup but the only thing I would like to be add is dark mode so the screen brightness won t make my eyes strain as much and is somewhat aesthetic 
len ratingfour  Is it possible to transfer Safari bookmarks to Chrome 
len ratingfour For people switching to Android 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingthree I have downloaded could not log in deleted the app and repeated the process 
len ratingthree After times f amp j c this app 
len ratingfive  I like it 
len ratingtwo I need Adblock in Chrome 
len ratingtwo Simple as that 
len ratingtwo I can t make the switch from Safari without it 
len ratingtwo Also I wish I could swipe on the tabs to close them 
len ratingone  Google is building a censored internet for the communist Chinese 
len ratingone Manipulating search results in this country for their political candidates 
len ratingone Openly working against the sitting President 
len ratingone Tracking banning censorship etc 
len ratingone But now google has censored a video by John Stossel on socialist violence in an apparent attempt to protect socialism from being seen in a negative light 
len ratingone Their attempts to influence our elections with search results and censorship are far worse than anything Russia could do 
len ratingone And might I add the co founder of google is RUSSIAN 
len ratingone And now they censor a video on socialist violence 
len ratingone  NeverGoogle Google is 
len ratingone Orwellian of the highest order 
len ratingtwo The new update has regressed this browser a lot 
len ratingtwo The tab switcher makes no sense it was perfect before 
len ratingtwo The overall moving of the whole control center down is good but has made it harder to access other things like bookmarks on the browser
len ratingthree Google what s happening to my Chrome 
len ratingthree It seems to get worse all the time and I love this browsers but it crashes gets stuck and lately I get these awful pop up virus things 
len ratingthree What s happening 
len ratingthree Please fix it 
len ratingone The new tab page is hard to use 
len ratingone Why remove the ability to swipe to close 
len ratingone I don t personally keep a ton of tabs open at once and would rather have ease of closing switching tabs than being able to view a lot of tabs at once 
len ratingone In general there s too much empty space in the interface now too 
len ratingone  star because we can no longer choose if we want to use the old interface or the new interface through chrome flags 
len ratingone I ve honestly switched to Safari now just for their better tab page 
len ratingone I might switch back if the interface gets a better design 
len ratingone  You give your life to google when you use their products 
len ratingone The high quality services and software they offer are paid with your data your patterns etc 
len ratingone Just remember what is innocent today may be a crime tomorrow 
len ratingone Don t download the new update if you hate the new ui design cause you ll be stuck with it 
len ratingone At least give users the ability to use the version we want to 
len ratingtwo Honestly 
len ratingtwo All your apps freed for about seconds when I open then on my iPad Air 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating since i like the layout 
len ratingtwo Safari here I come 
len ratingone Y all need to do something about this please I had this for about a month hoping it will be fixed but of course still nothing I hate using safari that s why I want google back because it has all my important passwords and everything smh do something
len ratingone  The new tab page is hard to use because you can t swipe to close tabs anymore instead you re expected to tap a tiny X 
len ratingone I don t personally keep a ton of tabs open at once and would rather have ease of closing switching tabs than being able to view a lot of tabs at once 
len ratingone In general there s too much empty space in the interface now too 
len ratingone  star because we can no longer choose if we want to use the old interface or the new interface through chrome flags 
len ratingone I m honestly going to find a different browser to use for iOS now 
len ratingfour When I m at the screen with all my tabs the close X button is incredibly small 
len ratingfour Add a swipe feature 
len ratingfour Or make the buttons bigger 
len ratingone Please give us back the option to go back to the old design this one is awful 
len ratingfive This browser is definitely a must use 
len ratingthree Dislike the new update 
len ratingfour  La traducci n de p ginas es muy lenta no es fluida como en androide 
len ratingfour Was not expecting the charge don t remember seeing any indication that there would be a charge 
len ratingfour Anyone else pay for it 
len ratingfour Did I miss the charge
len ratingone Version will no longer open the HESI Secure Browser app from Elsevier when an exam link is clicked on a web page 
len ratingone This functionality worked in the previous version of Chrome but no longer functions since updating today 
len ratingone Please help 
len ratingtwo The new update is truly bad
len ratingone New UI forces the app to look like Safari 
len ratingone Horrible upgrade 
len ratingtwo Latest update seems to have eliminated the ability to bookmark a page on iOS 
len ratingone You took away the ability to switch back to the old design so I m switching browsers 
len ratingone The only reason I stuck around after the initial roll out was because you allowed the new appearance to be toggled off 
len ratingone Now that you ve taken away that option I will no longer use your mobile app and therefore have no reason to use the desktop app either 
len ratingone New format is like using safari awful and inconvenient 
len ratingone I liked the older and more easily accessible version 
len ratingtwo Inefficient on iPhone SE 
len ratingtwo I could just use Safari of I wanted a UI experience like this 
len ratingone  Ha ha Fixes to sic authentication issues Chrome and Google will not log me in to my work account without manual entry for name the site needs domain username which Google s apps will not retain and then an old password is offered by Google 
len ratingone Safari and Edge log in flawlessly 
len ratingone Useless app for me 
len ratingone Someone at Google needs to wake up 
len ratingone When chrome cast available on this app 
len ratingtwo Do not like at all
len ratingtwo i downloaded chrome and it never put the app on my screen but yet when i look it up in the search bar i can open it and when i look it up in app store it comes up as downloaded 
len ratingone  App is slow on I phone xs max
len ratingfive Tbest browser ever hanks for new design 
len ratingone As the title says
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use a browser that looks like Safari I would use Safari 
len ratingtwo The new version is a big pile of hot garbage change it back you savages 
len ratingone Last upgrade to make chrome appear more like Safari completely ruined it 
len ratingone When you bookmark something it covers up the entire tool bar 
len ratingfive  I like it 
len ratingtwo This new design is no more of an improvement than New Coke was in the past 
len ratingtwo I absolutely hate it 
len ratingtwo I m giving Google a short period of time to change back before going back to Firefox 
len ratingtwo My google chrome got bugged out and moved everything 
len ratingtwo It was working fine until i clicked update all 
len ratingtwo Im not sure if google made a forced downgrade or if another app managed to corrupt my google app how do i upgrade back to the old version 
len ratingone I ve been trying to download this app on my iPhone for a while now and it says it downloaded but then won t open 
len ratingone I ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it will not take on the iPhone OS
len ratingone Continuously locks up and crashes 
len ratingone Horrible Never had this problem before 
len ratingthree  When reading first chapter didn t get translate to English until third chapter then went back to first chapter it won t translate when put always translate option
len ratingfive The other reviews discussing this app don t give any good reasons to hate it 
len ratingfive The new interface personally looks pretty good and even less clunky which others might say actually is 
len ratingfive Don t judge this app for its reviews 
len ratingfive Try it with an open mind 
len ratingone  I hate Chrome 
len ratingone Every time I m on chrome I get pop ups saying I won something it won t go away 
len ratingone Fix this annoying problem I ll reinstall it
len ratingfive  I lie this app it has everything I need
len ratingone All is bugging out crashing and freezing 
len ratingone Headed on a safari till the next update
len ratingone App is killing me
len ratingfour Chrome is super fast on my pixel phone somehow it loads pages slow on my iPhone XR 
len ratingfour Surprisingly safari loads pages faster than Chrome 
len ratingfour Something is wrong here 
len ratingfour It must be an update issue 
len ratingfive  Yes you know the app and it does get better with you working on it to check out what I was working online good app 
len ratingthree reeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrr
len ratingfive It was very easy to use everything is straight forward and very easy to get around with
len ratingone This is horrible my eyes hurt looks old as sh t this new version is going to be a scary bed time story for my kids Once upon a time we had a great search engine called Chrome 
len ratingone With a very lovely version and then Chrome made and new version that terminated us all THE END 
len ratingone Goodnight kids 
len ratingone Every few pages I click on chrome will stop loading and freeze on a blank white screen 
len ratingone Refreshing and closing the app doesn t fix it 
len ratingone I have to hope that it starts working again 
len ratingone It s getting extremely annoying 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingtwo Don t update chrome 
len ratingtwo Just don t do it 
len ratingtwo The new tab system is stupid and the browser looks so dumb now 
len ratingtwo The way playlists work in YouTube is stupid now as well 
len ratingtwo Here s a tip google if it s not broke don t fix it 
len ratingone The new version stinks it s hard to set up and the help on the iPhone isn t working very well I would not recommend it if you got an older version of Chrome I will stay with it they do not update to the new one google needs to go back and re think what they did
len ratingfive It helps me with many rings I try to search I know other people site things on there but I don t follow scams 
len ratingone Seriously just swapped to Edge because of this 
len ratingone Thank you for doing this update because I m actually enjoying Edge now 
len ratingfour Love that I can use D touch to highlight text and quickly access any menus 
len ratingfour Would like to see a powerful peek and pop feature using D touch brought to links 
len ratingfour And a Search Google link in the context menu when highlighting text would be great 
len ratingone Totally confusing and ugly update
len ratingone All my normal bank sites and most of my every day used sites I login into not have issues with pages not opening and I have lost access to them because it says I need the newest version of Chrome I should have it on my I phone but the newest update has taken away everything I had 
len ratingone What s the problem 
len ratingtwo  The iOS version of this app is clunky hard to navigate and generally a terrible experience 
len ratingtwo I absolutely love the windows chrome os Mac OS and android versions of this app and I use the app almost everywhere but this app needs to be changed to something akin to the android version 
len ratingone Too slow doesn t load pages properly 
len ratingtwo I love this system but I swear I have problems getting it to cast daily 
len ratingone How many times do I have to tap the screen in the exact same spot to close a tab 
len ratingone Fix your retarded update you pathetic spoiled overpaid pieces of garbage 
len ratingfive  Do you want free robux just kidding this isn t 
len ratingfive A scam but fortnitefortnitefortnitefortnitefortnitefortnitefortnitefortnite I loooooooooove chrome forntitefortnitefortnitefortnitefortnite
len ratingone I cant manually search in chrome 
len ratingone Had ti change the search engine to Yahoo to search 
len ratingone Fix it please
len ratingone Slow af 
len ratingone Not worth ur time 
len ratingone Trust me 
len ratingone It s the crappiest app u ll ever use 
len ratingone Works poorly has ugly design is poorly integrated with iOS 
len ratingone Chrome cannot download pictures to Photos app on iPad 
len ratingone Many plugins do not work properly with Chrome browser 
len ratingone It does not offer search alternatives to Google Bing or Yahoo 
len ratingone Please do not install this badly designed app 
len ratingone It is a much worse product than the default Safari browser 
len ratingone If you are trying to sync your Google products across many devices I recommend using apps made by a variety of manufacturers to avoid complete dependency on a single technology company with questionable motives 
len ratingone Who in their right mind decided to update chrome to this insanely downgraded browser that crashes on an hourly basis but it never even crashes it just whites out the webpage you already loaded then acts like you are doing too much on it so it breaks causing you to force crash every time 
len ratingone Why google 
len ratingone Why fix something that didn t need fixing and break it 
len ratingthree I want to call from contact list
len ratingfour Five is perfect 
len ratingfour No Google isn t perfect 
len ratingfour However it was in my experience a problem of small glitches too often 
len ratingfour I was sufficiently frustrated with Google to switch to Firefox then Safari 
len ratingfour Well because of the delays and necessary re submissions with both of those I came back to the BIG G Sometimes you just have to experience the loss of something to re appreciate it s value 
len ratingone  Why the rating 
len ratingone Lower the age limit and I will change my review 
len ratingone Please and thank you 
len ratingfive I really like google chrome this is just a style thing themes for the google home page should be available on mobile as well as on other devices 
len ratingfive This is my only advise 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingthree I like the update surprisingly 
len ratingthree It s a good app but I hav two complaints 
len ratingthree There needs to be a way to not open up a new app i e 
len ratingthree I m on chrome and hit a link to Amazon and it jumps over to the Amazon app 
len ratingthree Please quit that sometimes I want to look at Amazon from chrome so I can save the page 
len ratingthree I really really want a password lock on privacy mode 
len ratingthree If I forget I left that page open and just open up chrome I don t want something private being displayed in front of all my friends 
len ratingthree Make a password option so people can t get into my private tabs 
len ratingthree Other that chrome is still good 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingthree Needs update for new screen sizes 
len ratingone  Everything was ok but now when you search up movies you can t scroll to the side to see the cast 
len ratingone You have to manually type it in 
len ratingone Some of you might not find this that important but when you look up movies and their cast daily this decision to make it to where you have to manually look up cast is dumb instead of just scrolling to the side when you see the movie 
len ratingone One thing google 
len ratingone Please fix and I ll go back to stars 
len ratingone Seriously the worst and most on user friendly app and cite I ve worked with yet 
len ratingone Used it for years but now Safari just works better 
len ratingone My personal favorite is when it crashes during the process of restarting after a prior crash thereby eradicating its memory of what tabs were open prior to the first crash 
len ratingone The first member of a new software category Crashware designed to waste user s time 
len ratingone This is bulky slow and buggy 
len ratingone The search is also biased and non inclusive to all content 
len ratingone They re basically china on the internet 
len ratingone A simple search for news stories ignores right and center media and replaces it with extreme left 
len ratingone I m done 
len ratingone The new update will not install on my device iPhone in fact the chrome icon is blanked out and won t launch at all anymore
len ratingone It pains me to write this as I am not a fan of Chrome in general but the iOS version flat misses the mark 
len ratingone I fire it up after every update to see if they have added one then go back to Safari 
len ratingone Give me back my tab bar and I ll give you back your stars 
len ratingthree  Find function broken 
len ratingthree It cannot even find words that I Copy from your Browser and Paste into your Find field 
len ratingthree Words which are in front of my eyes on your Browser 
len ratingthree  La traducci n de p ginas es muy lenta no es fluida como en androide 
len ratingone This is just safari 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Just why 
len ratingone  The UI is less than pleasing 
len ratingone The guts 
len ratingone I assume is worth it 
len ratingone But I don t interact with the code only the UI 
len ratingone And there s a reason they do t give you good examples it isn t enjoyable 
len ratingtwo The new update has ruined this app 
len ratingtwo Looks like Safari and that s the reason why I was using this app 
len ratingone I hate the new update 
len ratingone Im spending more time navigating around because of the new unnecessary step to use this app 
len ratingone Stop forcing people to adapt to a size fit model 
len ratingone I miss the old look and feel 
len ratingone Just because
len ratingfive It is easier than safari and everything else
len ratingtwo I have been a Chrome fan for years 
len ratingtwo But with this version crashing and freezing I don t know how long we can stay together 
len ratingtwo Let s not break up so fix yourself 
len ratingfive I just find the dino game its perfect 
len ratingone Since last update cannot switch from desktop site to mobile site 
len ratingtwo i used to love chrome but now with this new update it s as if they downgraded instead of up 
len ratingtwo please bring the old style back it was way more easier to control and move around on 
len ratingtwo i used chrome to read my books but now i m going to have to find a new browser 
len ratingone Yes in years of using every smartphone platform I have never taken the time to write a review 
len ratingone The new Chrome design steps backwards and has me evaluating alternatives 
len ratingone What pulled me to Chrome initially was the Back button at the top which I prefer 
len ratingone Yes that was THE unique value proposition for me as an alternative to Safari 
len ratingone The mandatory autohide feature of the toolbar reminds me of when people enable a similar taskbar feature on their computers oh wait but that s a configurable option 
len ratingone With Chrome the autohide is unnecessary and adds an extra step to use the back button 
len ratingone Changes like these should be configurable 
len ratingone Chrome are you trying to be like Safari 
len ratingthree Please fix chrome 
len ratingthree I ve stopped using it for the past months on my iPad because it crashes within minute of being launched 
len ratingthree Grrrr 
len ratingone WTF 
len ratingone I already said once to stop auto opening certain apps sometimes I rather use the browser version 
len ratingone One star until this is changed 
len ratingfive  coo
len ratingone Google has persistently proven to be the most pernicious purveyor of misused private data for pecuniary purposes 
len ratingone Looking forward to my last remnants of Google apps being removed 
len ratingone But I did have fun with p words 
len ratingone The new navigation is terrible browsing is now a frustrating puzzle 
len ratingone I hated Safari for years but now I m forced to use it 
len ratingthree  Hate the design that s about it
len ratingone  What in the actual F did you do google 
len ratingone The UI looks like garbage 
len ratingone I dunno how else to say it 
len ratingone It just looks terrible 
len ratingone Overdose clunky looking icons everything moved from its place 
len ratingone Used to just click the star to bookmark a page now you gotta open the menu which is now moved from the top to the bottom why 
len ratingone scroll around and then click book mark 
len ratingone Update for the sake of updating 
len ratingone Always a dumb move 
len ratingone Back to safari for now 
len ratingtwo I don t want to go to the google home page and see a whole bunch of what s trending adds on the front page 
len ratingtwo I see enough adds on YouTube and pretty much every other website as it is 
len ratingtwo Yeah there are some articles that catch my attention but it s nothing I can t just look up later 
len ratingfive  Love the swipe to refresh close tab and new tab 
len ratingfive Love the tab system and navigation bar that s not on Android 
len ratingfive Favorite version of chrome 
len ratingone Can no longer find my emails 
len ratingone Just showing a bunch of junk that I m not going going to read 
len ratingone It keeps telling me to download Google Chrome so I hit that button and nothing happens 
len ratingone It kept telling me to download Google Chrome 
len ratingone In desperation I finally decided to delete the app that I had loosing everything that was on it 
len ratingone Went to App Store and downloaded it again 
len ratingone Guess what still get nothing but junk that I feel should be in the spam folder and still can t find my mail 
len ratingone You know like edge are doing 
len ratingone With Adblock I ll download it 
len ratingone  Every update lately just makes it worse and worse 
len ratingone If I wanted safari UI I d use safari
len ratingone The worst update in chrome history oops you accidentally closed a tab oops you accidentally refreshed the page oops this app has become worse than trash 
len ratingfive Easy and awesome
len ratingone I can t get into the game
len ratingone  Each update recently seems to make Chrome for iOS worse and then today all my tabs suddenly disappeared 
len ratingone Now some tabs it s been a few days since I opened so I can t find it in my history recipes things I m considering buying items such as that 
len ratingone Wish they would go back to the stable product they used to have 
len ratingfive No more thumb stretch HOORAY 
len ratingfive I LOVE that you moved the back button and tabs down to the bottom 
len ratingfive My thumb thanks you as well 
len ratingfive I try to never use Safari so I can t say if it looks like Safari as the Reviewer who didn t care for the update mentioned 
len ratingfive Frankly I only care about the useability this should be a word and not words 
len ratingfive I m a busy mom with young kids so I need to be able to navigate quickly and switch between saved tabs often for teams schedules and recipes and shopping and poison control 
len ratingfive You have made that infinitely easier with this update 
len ratingfive BAM screen views at once swipe for more GAME CHANGER dogs that ate entire packages of Oreos saved 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone It keeps telling me I don t have internet but I do evidently by the fact that my safari is able to load pages just fine 
len ratingone I agree with others I HATE that it looks like safari 
len ratingone I want my bookmarks and tabs and everything else back at the top 
len ratingone Also the close all tabs button is where the cancel button would intuitively be bottom left corner so I almost accidentally close all my tabs when I m trying to return to the tab I had open 
len ratingone Also the search button at the bottom is useless and redundant you can just press the giant address bar at the top which most chrome users will already know 
len ratingone If you re going to make drastic interface changes give users an option to go back to a previous version 
len ratingfive Safari is better than u
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfour I didn t receive my package on the and still haven t got 
len ratingfour U want me to do a survey and I don t have any of my orders

len ratingfour Typical p Re
len ratingthree I love google chrome 
len ratingthree I live by it on my laptop but not a huge fan of it in app form 
len ratingthree Constantly freezes when I try logging in using the keychain passwords in my iPhone 
len ratingthree I can t read through a webpage without it reloading to the top of the page 
len ratingthree Seems like most sites I have to open in safari because it s just not working in chrome 
len ratingtwo The browser itself is very nice but I don t trust google 
len ratingtwo Plain and simple 
len ratingtwo Use the DuckDuckGo app 
len ratingtwo It may not be as fancy but at least you have your privacy and UNBIASED search results 
len ratingone  i used to love chrome now it s just a cheap copy of safari go back 
len ratingone While I m not a fan of the new ui I can work with it 
len ratingone But there is a bug when you have a website that you want to share via iMessage it will cover the text entry field so you can t see what you are typing 
len ratingone Pongo abrir y abre una p gina de numeritos porqu no abre el programa app de google chrome 
len ratingfive  My IPhone Plus Red is just not letting me download any of your Apps 
len ratingfive Hey Google what have you done to create this situation with Apple 
len ratingfive OH MEH GAH BOI EVER SINCE I GOT THIS F 
len ratingfive I LUVED SO MUCHIE AND IT HAS A GREAT UPDATE I JUST LUV DIS APP I COUKD DO I A LOT OF STUFF ON HERE I JUST LUV T MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD IT NOW IF U HAVENT WHAT DA F ARE U DOING B GO GET UR A AND DOWNLAOD IT OKI BUH BAI 
len ratingfour  In love with the solid improvements in function and form 
len ratingone  Please add extensions and please improve your pop up blocker it s terrible and remove the auto translate feature for chrome it s very confusing
len ratingtwo  I am so tired of getting that OH SNAP error message 
len ratingtwo I look at the same sites with other browsers and never get an error message 
len ratingtwo It s enough 
len ratingtwo This browser also doesn t play nice with Facebook either 
len ratingtwo It just freezes 
len ratingtwo I give up 
len ratingtwo I ve switched to Microsoft Edge 
len ratingtwo OH SNAP to you Google 
len ratingone Finally decided to update Chrome and so sorry I did 
len ratingone Wish I had read reviews first 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would use Safari 
len ratingone Thought maybe I had opened it by accident but nope Chrome is now garbage like Safari Off to find a new browser I guess 
len ratingone Interface used to be okay 
len ratingone Now it just became a broken version of those kiddy phone apps 
len ratingone I didn t even update it the app itself just forced it randomly 
len ratingone There needs to be an option to use a previous or older version 
len ratingtwo I hate this update 
len ratingone Because of the new update every couple mins my iPad just turns of and it glitches out my entire iPad like I turn in on again and it turns right off 
len ratingone And I m pretty much always using chrome but the new update is preventing me from relaxing 
len ratingone I just want to sit down on the couch and be able to use chrome without a problem at all but I can t 
len ratingthree When will Google make this otherwise excellent browser work with Blogger like it does in a computer 
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfive  Good app for everything
len ratingtwo Google Chrome was like my Family 
len ratingtwo I always use Google Chrome more than Safari 
len ratingtwo It was the Only browser I choose to use on a daily basis 
len ratingtwo But it had done 
len ratingtwo This new Version of Google Chrome is a Sh t But Im lucky this version of Chrome teached me two Lesson 
len ratingtwo First of all The Chrome use too much Data while in Cellular 
len ratingtwo Even on Standby When the Mobile data for Chrome is ON 
len ratingtwo Second Safari is better than Google Chrome now 
len ratingtwo Chrome doesn t deserve even Star 
len ratingone The new version sucs
len ratingtwo Whatever they did with the update has made the app nonfunctional for me for almost months now 
len ratingtwo It crashes almost immediately every time I open it 
len ratingtwo I don t understand why they haven t figured it out by now
len ratingtwo The latest Chrome update completely changed the interface to feel like an old version of Safari 
len ratingtwo The reason I used Chrome is because I HATE THE SAFARI DESIGN 
len ratingtwo Bad job Google 
len ratingtwo Maybe I ll see what Firefox is up to these days 
len ratingfour Please add support for profiles like you have on desktop 
len ratingfour I have three profiles I use on a regular basis on my desktop and I can t convert that to my use on the iPad which is a bummer when it s my main device for the day 
len ratingfour Adding this support would further improve the usability of my device further support that Chrome has the greatest support of any browser 
len ratingone Do your People who update the Chrome App ever try it out before asking us to update 
len ratingone I m actually very Curious 
len ratingone Obviously you have Imbeciles working on the recent Chrome Update 
len ratingone It s awful like about the WORST UPDATE EVER 
len ratingone I like to be able to Check Out my Bookmarks which is almost impossible with this New Update 
len ratingone How idiotic of you People 
len ratingone We spend a ton of money to have an iPhone only for imbeciles to Eff Up our Life 
len ratingone I m extremely unhappy I want my old Chrome back 
len ratingone Danke 
len ratingthree  Love chrome way better than safari 
len ratingone Chrome was great but this new bottom navigating bar is so jarring and just awful 
len ratingone I ve been trying to get used to it the past month but it s just that bad 
len ratingone Will appear randomly even if I have not touched the page and takes up so much screen that you can barely see what you re looking at 
len ratingone Much preferred older version 
len ratingone Do not upgrade if you can help it 
len ratingfive  Mmk
len ratingtwo  I am seeing a really old snapshot rather than the current state of the app while switching back from another app to chrome like the double click on iPhone 
len ratingtwo Which means even after closing the app my content and that too the older state stays visible for almost forever 
len ratingfive November When I try to download the Chrome App to an ipad using the new ios I get a message in effect stating I cannot download Chrome because I first have to turn off restrictions 
len ratingfive Problem is I have no restrictions turned on 
len ratingfive Screen time is off 
len ratingfive Anybody having the same problem 
len ratingone Since the update on my iPhone my Google Chrome is not working properly it s reverting over to Safari I hate Safari I don t ever want to use it I don t like having it run and operate in the background Anything I copy and paste and send to people that don t have an iPhone cannot open the link because it s Safari
len ratingone Google earns money using ads but there should be some way for people to stop annoying force redirect ads like Amazon gift card Walmart gift card ones
len ratingone Using iPhone Apple watch and airpods Chrome pauses the media payback on my watch whenever it loads 
len ratingone I didn t notice this for some time because I wasn t actually playing media on the watch itself but now that I am it s extremely frustrating 
len ratingone I haven t had this with other apps just Chrome 
len ratingone  Please undo the last update 
len ratingone We hated when you closed our incognito tabs 
len ratingone We hated when you changed the layout 
len ratingone Stop changing things damnit 
len ratingone Also freezes when I try to post a picture 
len ratingone I wish I could download version EDIT I can t use this anymore 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingone It s very irritating due to the fact it doesn t want to load during navigation 
len ratingone It needs a new update
len ratingone  Please undo the last update 
len ratingone We hated when you closed our incognito tabs 
len ratingone We hated when you changed the layout

len ratingone  Please undo the last update 
len ratingone We hated when you closed our incognito tabs 
len ratingone We hated when you changed the layout 
len ratingone Stop changing things damnit
len ratingone  This app only allows you to use Google search engine stores every personal data it can get and keeps it forever 
len ratingone New UI doesn t work with many websites 
len ratingone Auto fill and passwords is broken 
len ratingone They basically took a working app and broke it 
len ratingone Guess it s back to safari
len ratingtwo Hey 
len ratingtwo You know what you did so stop it 
len ratingfour Not at all like on a computer 
len ratingfour Needs bookmark bar 
len ratingone I never leave reviews 
len ratingone But I am passed the point of being annoyed hoping for it to get better 
len ratingone The new design is so much like Firefox that I ve actually closed the app several times thinking that I had clicked on the wrong one mistakenly 
len ratingone Many reviews do a great job describing the issues with the new design so I will just add my me too to the list 
len ratingone However I also want to voice my annoyance at the constant crashing of the app 
len ratingone  from someone who used to LOVE chrome and is now in search of a replacement 
len ratingtwo Whenever I try to translate a page in another language into English it tells me there s a problem with the server 
len ratingtwo I think someone broke the translator on my device 
len ratingtwo If it was me then I m crazy 
len ratingtwo If you could update google so that it would suit my device I would be happy 
len ratingone They updated this and it looks terrible now and is harder to use Don t waste your time with this browser until they undo the update 
len ratingone The new update has destroyed the feel of the app 
len ratingone Please go back to the old format or make it possible to manually select it 
len ratingone Feels like safari
len ratingone You d think being made by google it would be top of the line 
len ratingone I want to like chrome but every time I try to log in I get an error message so I cannot sync my account 
len ratingone Also no ad blocking availability is a big negative 
len ratingtwo Tries to much to be safari 
len ratingtwo All usability that I liked before I now gone 
len ratingtwo Cannot eve webpage to read offline 
len ratingtwo What is chrome even useful for anymore 
len ratingtwo I think I m going to switch browse apps 
len ratingone Why d the back button disappear 
len ratingone Worst browser 
len ratingone Plz fix it
len ratingone Should not open my incognito windows willy nilly like that 
len ratingfive  Google if you re reading this you re the best company ever you deserve million dollers bonce million dollers 
len ratingfive I love chrome ever sense I got chrome I loved it I hate Firefox Microsoft edge and more but chrome of course is not on the hated list well in my opinion the thing i wish is a password for the history and i don t really like that there is only one shortcut piece in iOS I wish there was show history but I know that google can t fix it Apple can because Apple made the shortcut app whoops bought the app and modified it Great just please add a password option for history
len ratingone Gotta say I m not a fan at all of the new design 
len ratingone It s been longer than a month and I m still getting lost between screens trying to find basic functions like bookmarks and other tabs and it s just not something you get used to 
len ratingone Sorry guys I deeply preferred the last theme to this one 
len ratingone Is there any way to get it back manually or am I stuck with this one now 
len ratingtwo It is just so annoying how websites launched from search remain within search 
len ratingtwo What really destroys the UX is how they enforce adds by making it harder to swipe past them 
len ratingtwo Pathetic 
len ratingtwo Please fix this nonsense design 
len ratingone Get constant aw snap errors on pages that work fine in safari 
len ratingone Resetting and clearing cache doesn t help much 
len ratingtwo The update makes me feel like I m opening Safari 
len ratingtwo Not happy with the update 
len ratingone  Good morning I use Uber before when I call it shows but but after they charge I think driver doesn t know the way because when I use Uber before it take only Half an hour but yesterday it take long time so when I see in maps he take long round way 
len ratingone Seriously Zero stars on this Dev s 
len ratingone Chrome was awesome for YEARS 
len ratingone My fam s fav since it was hatched but after the last update the boxes format it absolutely bites in a very non pleasant way 
len ratingone We re all bailing out to another search engine 
len ratingone Maybe it s different on other platforms but as a mobile user it s absolutely AWFUL 
len ratingone I use another on my PC s tablets but wow this is SO TERRIBLE 
len ratingone  please undo the update 
len ratingfive  Love Chrome 
len ratingfive Thank you developers 
len ratingtwo why fix something that isn t broken 
len ratingtwo when everyone is used to the functions being in a certain place then all of a sudden we re all reaching to the wrong place 
len ratingtwo why is there a looming close all function in my tool bar just waiting for me to accidentally close all my work 
len ratingtwo this should be hidden 
len ratingtwo i don t even know what the point of this was absolutely nothing seems any better 
len ratingtwo just different with a much more lame aesthetic 
len ratingtwo especially when you can see all of your pages this reminds me of play time in compared with the cool slidey portfolio that used to exist 
len ratingtwo oh and this looks inspired by safari 
len ratingfour Google Is Only Speeds Up To Firefox Internet Exploer Speeds Up To Sad
len ratingfour Crap crap 
len ratingone Mostly privacy concerns
len ratingfour I can not believe anything could be as horrible as safari 
len ratingfour I hear my grandson all the time saying that blasted safari 
len ratingfour He sounds just like me 
len ratingfour Safari should never have been put out there for use 
len ratingfour Loading very slowly 
len ratingfour Wherefore 
len ratingtwo Why is it so ugly 
len ratingone I am a big fan of chrome and most of google s apps I downloaded Chrome to use over Safari and Google Maps over Apple Maps 
len ratingone But this update is terrible it is not at all user friendly and may make me go back to Safari 
len ratingone Everything is moved around and the worst part is the new tab feature the old one was so convenient to quickly see and select from all open tabs 
len ratingone Please improve on what was working don t scrap a good layout 
len ratingone Bug Desktop on youtube opens the YouTube app 
len ratingfour Please update your Chrome using on MacOS Mojave 
len ratingfour It has several problems
len ratingthree  Ok Why no Flash 
len ratingthree I know Apple doesn t allow this but please sneak it in 
len ratingthree I would like it on iPad too but I have a great computer but I want to do it EVERYWHERE in the house 
len ratingthree Appreciate it 
len ratingthree Don t tell Apple 
len ratingthree  ok ill stop 
len ratingfour  Like it 
len ratingfive Easy fast and good browser 
len ratingfive It s a very good app 
len ratingfive  Its totally way better than safari 
len ratingfive As long as I have been going there I have never met a person as nice as Jermaine brown 
len ratingfive As long as he is there 
len ratingfive I will always come there 
len ratingfive You
len ratingone iPad doesn t support the chrome app 
len ratingone Chrome needs an iOS or higher 
len ratingone I really want the app on my iPad

len ratingone Title says it all 
len ratingone Deleted
len ratingone  The new design was clearly implemented to attract Chrome users to the Google Search App instead of Chrome because more data can be gathered there 
len ratingone Horrible design 
len ratingone Nobody likes it 
len ratingone Change it 
len ratingone Why google why 
len ratingone I am left with fewer options for browsers now 
len ratingone There isn t my difference between safari and chrome 
len ratingtwo So after clicking on the search field on Google s homepage in order to continue searching you need to swipe down in order to see what is being typed 
len ratingtwo If what you are typing begins with a previous search it auto selects that item causing an unwanted search 
len ratingtwo This update needs work 
len ratingtwo Got tired of this app using a large percentage of my IPad Pro battery had to delete it 
len ratingone Okay so I downloaded the app and it says this website or page is temporarily down or has been tooken down And I thought oh well im going to search up another one then 
len ratingone So I did and what did I find 
len ratingone The same message 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone If chrome was just as great as YouTube I would have given it stars 
len ratingone I can t even use Chrome for more than seconds since the update every time I open the app within seconds it crashes and auto closes the application 
len ratingone Please fix Chrome I really don t want to have to go back to using Safari 
len ratingone This new update is hideous and terrible 
len ratingone Please go back immediately
len ratingone The new interface is essentially a ripoff of Safari now the app is incredibly slower than previous iterations 
len ratingone Please go back to the previous aesthetic 
len ratingone  this is the THIRD time i am making this review 
len ratingone THE NEW UI UX IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND GOOGLE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF IT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO REMOVE REVIEWS
len ratingtwo Don t mind the layout too much but ever since I updated I have ran into multiple scam pop ups with no way to block or avoid them 
len ratingtwo I can t look at other websites without something telling me I ve won an iPhone or something along those words with no other option but to continue onto that site 
len ratingtwo It s really frustrating and impossible to avoid 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingone The new version of chrome incorporates all the same warmed over garbage from safari that drove me to it in the first place 
len ratingone I m beginning to forget why I switched in the first place 
len ratingone The look and feel too basic 
len ratingone Too many pictures and not enough words 
len ratingone Incomplete urls in the address bar 
len ratingone Some gestures were replaced with tiny buttons 
len ratingone  Looking at you tab menu 
len ratingone Did the menu have to move from the top to the bottom 
len ratingone Did everything have to move 
len ratingone This update was a major step backward and I would change back if I could easily 
len ratingone I guess I ll give Safari another shot and maybe save some space by deleting this app 
len ratingtwo  With all due respect but I am not updating this browser any further I see how this update looks and I prefer the navigation bar up then down 
len ratingone Version Favorites are not in alphabetical numerical order 
len ratingone Folders and individual pages are grouped altogether and they are in chronological order 
len ratingone There is no SEARCH feature 
len ratingone How do users to locate pinpoint a particular favorite page folder quickly 
len ratingone The favorite field cell became even shorter for users to edit 
len ratingone You can only edit the end of the default information 
len ratingone You have to delete all default information if you want to edit from the beginning 
len ratingone Pain in the butt 
len ratingone I don t like the new design 
len ratingtwo Very ugly yet faster than safari please update the UI and fix the tab system
len ratingtwo Three Words Slow as fire truckldy fraggldy 
len ratingone Why did you have to make it look like Safari 
len ratingone It was perfect the way it was now is just awful 
len ratingone Not intuitive clunky hard to navigate 
len ratingone We use Chrome because we don t like Safari
len ratingone If I wanted to use something that looked like Safari then I d use Safari oh and the desktop chrome is starting to look like Firefox 
len ratingone  Please TRY to explain your guys choice on this new design 
len ratingtwo The reason why I used Chrome was because I don t like Safari now chrome reminds me of Safari 
len ratingtwo Will probably uninstall
len ratingtwo I m sorry but your new update basically uses the same layout that Microsoft edge does 
len ratingtwo It does look nice and just having a search button on the bottom is cool but I mean I just don t get why every browser on iOS and android have to look exactly the same 
len ratingtwo Especially when they all use the same WebKit view or androids web view tool 
len ratingtwo It s not like in Windows where it s a different rendering tool 
len ratingtwo Sorry but I just love that google s way of staying on top is changing the layout to be like edge 
len ratingtwo Till the previous version the google chrome was the best and easier to use 
len ratingtwo Now it s difficult to use 
len ratingtwo Please bring back the earlier GUI 
len ratingfive Great little place in Reykjavik and nice breakfast 
len ratingfive And hope receptionist gets this my son and I are in line to board our flight thanks to her awesome help 
len ratingone I got this because I hate the safari app that this now looks and runs like 
len ratingone I miss the old app 
len ratingone I m going to end up deleting it 
len ratingone No point in keeping two of the same app now right 
len ratingone  I m convinced chrome s creators have autism 
len ratingone This new layout is literally made for years old kids to use 
len ratingone Deleted
len ratingone  Bookmarks don t sync 
len ratingone The app can t even render googles own pages correctly 
len ratingfive When trying to export PDF s anywhere nothing can read the file correctly 
len ratingfive Also I suggest making a multiple tab view like safari
len ratingtwo I downloaded chrome after a long time of using safari because i was having issues with the latter i had full trust that chrome would have no issues whatsoever 
len ratingtwo i was surprised to find it so slow its physically painful especially on social media sites like twitter and instagram i have to wait for minutes to log in 
len ratingtwo I would love this issue to be fixed because i like the new interface and i want to keep using chrome 
len ratingthree Original google is best for me 
len ratingthree I understand improving apps is the point but this is just the example of an issue for simple people 
len ratingthree The flooding of other info apps is in called for 
len ratingthree Next improve the google app and you will have made an effort for my sake 
len ratingthree There are WAY too many apps 
len ratingthree Thanks from Pam 
len ratingtwo  I cannot stand the navigation located at the bottom 
len ratingtwo It s very NOT user friendly especially when you re used to having the navigation on the top on desktop versions 
len ratingtwo It also is very frustrating that it s not consistent 
len ratingtwo In portrait mode it s at the bottom but if I turn my phone to landscape suddenly the back forward and tab selection options are at the top 
len ratingtwo Throws me for an unpleasant loop every time 
len ratingtwo C mon Chrome 
len ratingtwo You can do better 
len ratingone So I downloaded chrome because it s so much better on my laptop but on my phone it doesn t even work 
len ratingone When I try to search something it says this website may have been taken down 
len ratingone But that s EVERY time I search not once in a while all the time 
len ratingone  Please fix this
len ratingfour GLfaxaf afaccakahwofaF faddesfis zrdrwvaslg ar
len ratingone Please change the design 
len ratingone It s terrible 
len ratingone New design is absolutely trash 
len ratingone Should not have updated
len ratingone the redesign was wholly uncalled for 
len ratingone I really wish I d read the reviews before updating the app 
len ratingone the one reason I ever went through the trouble downloading an app other than the default browser for ios is because the I found the layout of safari unappealing 
len ratingone before this update chrome on a portable device felt very similar to chrome on a desktop which is what I wanted 
len ratingone now it just feels awkward to navigate through not nearly as intuitive as before 
len ratingtwo This app used to be great but after this last update you all seem to just be letting embeds do whatever they want and haven t given us a way to stop it 
len ratingtwo Used to be they wouldn t run at all if they were OBVIOUSLY MALICIOUS 
len ratingtwo But now every time I try to go on wikia sites I ve got fake Google sweepstakes pop ups and can t even use the site 
len ratingone Do not install this app 
len ratingone It looks ugly and it s nothing 
len ratingone Please use Safari 
len ratingthree Hate this new version 
len ratingthree Definitely not an improvement looks like Google has moved back in time 
len ratingthree Reminds me of Safari and there s a very good reason why I don t use Safari 
len ratingthree Only downloaded this because one of my other apps required it wish I hadn t updated 
len ratingthree I hate hate hateeeee the new update 
len ratingthree What s wrong with it so confusing and it keeps going back to previous page when I am not clicking nothing 
len ratingthree Google you gotta go back to the previous version 
len ratingone Absolutely terrible 
len ratingone What s the point of a mobile browser on a modern device that uses an interface out of 
len ratingone Not to mention that advertisements take up the entire screen causing the text to be unreadable 
len ratingone The pages load then refresh causing the page to jump on the screen 
len ratingone The menus are absolutely horrendous 
len ratingone Just trash 
len ratingone Bring back ie for all that 
len ratingone Mozilla here I come
len ratingthree The latest update is not good at all 
len ratingthree I thought at first I made a mistake and opened Safari 
len ratingthree Why would I want something similar to another browser 
len ratingthree There is a reason I don t use Safari and I had been using Chrome 
len ratingthree Please change back 
len ratingthree In addition many websites do not support the new changes 
len ratingone The newest update with google chrome does completely what it wants such as opening auto opening of a ad and launching a different app on my phone 
len ratingone I even tested this ad bug and it jumped from google chrome to my music app 
len ratingone While while scrolling through some websites occasionally a ad would show up and it would jump me from normal to incognito mode and vise versa 
len ratingone I ll stick with safari for the time being
len ratingone I m begging the developers to PLEASE MAKE THE SOFTWARE WITH THE ABILITY TO EXIT FROM POPUPS 
len ratingone Every time I get a pop up I now have to delete the app and redownload because I can t simply close the tab or hit the back button on the browser 
len ratingone All you did was make it look like safari 
len ratingone I get a lot of error pages where I did not before 
len ratingone Stick to what works 
len ratingfour Love the app wish I didn t have to click the search bar to start typing such a minor gripe but it helps make the experience just a bit more smooth 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingone  I was using it of the time until the recent update and realized that I was using Safari web browser for important task Furthermore for research regarding my studies chrome doesn t have two key features which is the ability to place a website shortcut to the home screen and the ability to create a PDF document version of a website site which is a critical must have 
len ratingone They OFFER nothing but to spy on you while logged into their browser 
len ratingone I m going to see how I could migrate all my bookmarks to safari which is better in terms of research 
len ratingfive You very fast to do for business we are God bless you for you and your campany
len ratingthree While this is still my browser of choice I don t like the new update 
len ratingthree As a lot of people have been saying it feels more clunky it feels A LOT like safari which I hate 
len ratingthree I still love google and it is still the fastest browser but it is getting frustrating to use it 
len ratingthree Please just do a redesign and some other smaller fixes 
len ratingthree Thank you for reading my feedback 
len ratingone I don t write reviews unless I am extremely unsatisfied or exceptionally satisfied with an item 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would already be using it 
len ratingone When I perform a search and need to update the search I start typing and the screen moves so I have to move the screen back to see what I am typing 
len ratingone If the developers want Chrome to look and feel like Safari then they should go work for Apple 
len ratingone Too many ads
len ratingone picture search doesn t work neither on safari nor on the app also annoyed by the notification that asks each time to translate although I click the x button 
len ratingone The new layout for chrome is the worst 
len ratingone If you re on the old version do yourself a favor and DO NOT update 
len ratingone Having the buttons at the bottom to move back and access tabs are a hindrance and in the way 
len ratingone Half the time my iPhone X thinks I m trying to access the bottom bar where you swipe up to close apps go home 
len ratingone The other half of the time the buttons are hidden and I have to scroll up and down just to reveal them 
len ratingone Also since this update I m seeing a lot more intrusive ads and pop over under tabs opening with ads 
len ratingone What happened to your security google 
len ratingone My Google app is so slow now 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone I have a brand new iPhone xs and it started happening yesterday
len ratingone  Every time I see an update pop up I excitedly hope it s a removal fix for what was forced out a week or so ago 
len ratingone Or at the very least a response to all the complaints would be nice with a message that rollbacks actual improvements are coming 
len ratingone Please revert this Safari copycat 
len ratingone PLEASE 
len ratingone Again if we wanted to be using Safari we would been doing so already 
len ratingone Well officially uninstalling 
len ratingone Tired of waiting for a revert fix to this failure of a new UI 
len ratingtwo Please switch it back too much like safari and that s exactly why I didn t use theirs 
len ratingtwo Guess I m about to not use yours 
len ratingthree Scrolling between pages is really laggy Sometimes I can t save images I see unless I go to safari I don t see a reading mode anywhere Either 
len ratingthree The android version is far better 
len ratingthree But I stick to safari anyways 
len ratingthree I just miss seeing my Computers tabs
len ratingtwo I switched to chrome for the UI and ease of use 
len ratingtwo But I m having A LOT of difficulty with viewing all content on a webpage 
len ratingtwo I don t have desktop view enabled yet most sites are not optimizing to mobile view 
len ratingtwo It s really frustrating 
len ratingtwo I m having to either switch to landscape mode which I hate to try and read a paragraph or scroll my page left and right to read it 
len ratingtwo It s incredibly annoying especially since I use my phone for a lot of work type business 
len ratingtwo Makes me far less efficient when someone sends me a link for a new candidate or an HR forum they d like me to review 
len ratingtwo And I m spending additional time just trying to read it correctly on the go 
len ratingtwo iPhone X Running iOS now issue was happening prior to upgrade from iOS 
len ratingone  I m convinced chrome s creators have autism 
len ratingone This new layout is literally made for years old kids to use 
len ratingone Deleted
len ratingfive  nueva contrase a para Facebook
len ratingtwo They should really make this useable for iPad users it s really annoying how I can t use my phone a certain time and I can t access chrome on my iPad otherwise chrome is fine
len ratingone Every news site or fandom wiki i visit and these ads will redirect me to scam websites 
len ratingone Its been years and i cant believe there still hasn t been a fix 
len ratingone  Why can t I get Google search page 
len ratingone This app is very annoying and disappointing 
len ratingone Every time I try to search the keyboard comes up and hides the search bar 
len ratingone Its also annoying that everyone I click on something that would usually load in the same tab spend in a different tab 
len ratingone I end up with tabs by the time I am done research 
len ratingone I just switched to an iPhone for research purposes and downloaded Chrome only to find that the tab system is absolutely abhorrent 
len ratingone You can t swipe away tabs or use gestures to switch to overview which makes having multiple tabs open an absolute chore 
len ratingone I hope they switch back to the old version or the system they have on Android 
len ratingone At this rate you d be better off using Safari 
len ratingone  Never in my life have I seen more ads pop in a browser Google has the ad thing down to a science and you re the lab rat 
len ratingone Do yourself and the world a favor and just use Safari with an ad blocker 
len ratingone The Internet will be a little more tolerable 
len ratingfive  This is amazing 
len ratingfive Taking the internet usage to a much easier level 
len ratingfive Great designing 
len ratingfive Great new innovative features 
len ratingone Another day another pointless shuffling of UI elements for this update 
len ratingone Tabs can t be easily viewed closed with a flick anymore it s now a clumsy column view that shrinks thumbnails and takes forever to navigate by comparison 
len ratingone Agree with others that this feels like a ripoff of the worst design elements of Safari 
len ratingone Menu items take more clicks to reach appearance is less pleasant guess it s time to go back to Firefox at least their sub par UI comes with better privacy protection 
len ratingone Creepy surveillance heavy browser that no longer has any meaningful stability advantages over other browsers and which has none of the privacy protections of Firefox or Safari 
len ratingone New version is worsey than any search engine 
len ratingone Previous version was fabulous 
len ratingone The normal Google app not Chrome is way better
len ratingone Updated without my consent 
len ratingone New version is horrible 
len ratingone Miss the old interface 
len ratingone Guess I ll just use Safari because what s the difference at this point 
len ratingtwo Gets hacked a lot 
len ratingtwo Uses an unbelievable amount of system overhead 
len ratingtwo Bring back secure fast running light And agile 
len ratingone This release is beyond terrible 
len ratingone The buttons at the bottom of the screen physically hurts my hand trying to use it and it s too much like safari which I left because I don t like the experience 
len ratingthree I originally chose this mobile browser because it was more like a desktop browser with all the menu operations at the top where they should be instead of having stuff on the bottom like the built in Safari browser 
len ratingthree I guess I need to search for a new one if google has decided they want to copy the design mistakes I m trying to get away from 
len ratingthree The new design is a ripoff of safari and incorporates all the safari things you don t like like hard to find bookmarks and tabs 
len ratingthree Not good 
len ratingone I get that the idea putting the task bar at the bottom is to make it easier to reach with large phones 
len ratingone However this design is ugly and is forcing me to relearn years of muscle memory 
len ratingone You need to give people the option to revert instead of deciding what is best for them 
len ratingone Swipe to go back gives haptic feedback need an option to disable it 
len ratingone Google discover integration with new tab will be more useful than suggested articles which looks more like a clutter 
len ratingone Google has so many good ideas but implementation is worst whether it is hardware or software 
len ratingone Google lacks vision 
len ratingone It is just a company filled with smart coders who have lot of potential but don t have direction to deliver those ideas in a good user friendly way 
len ratingtwo Worst update ever 
len ratingtwo It s just like safari now which I can t stand using 
len ratingtwo It s slow and looks outdated 
len ratingtwo Please bring back the old Google 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is way better than Safari 
len ratingfive Well everybody says I don t like Google Chrome I say I love Google Chrome 
len ratingfive So you know that everybody is sometimes a copy cat right 
len ratingfive I rated the app five stores because when I tried it out the homepage looks so cool 
len ratingfive Take it to the developer and the creator of this app so I can look up stuff in the stuff 
len ratingfive PS Safari is stupid 
len ratingthree Can we get the choice to choose between the new layout and the previous one 
len ratingthree The new one feels like an off brand browser that went a bit crazy with the rounded edges and gray on lighter gray color schemes 
len ratingthree Also the new tab system is a major downgrade 
len ratingthree If anything I would appreciate the option to use the old tab system 
len ratingone I mainly used this app to listen to music in the background on YouTube 
len ratingone After the update can t do it now 
len ratingone This app is pointless 
len ratingone I d rather go back to Safari
len ratingtwo I agree wholeheartedly 
len ratingtwo I prefer GOOGLE more than any especially dialikey Safari 
len ratingtwo Isn t there a happy medium 
len ratingtwo I cannot get ANYWHERE with this CHROME HOW can I OR please infor as to what how extensive a task would it be to allow Google Multicolored G One App All Gmail a counts or whatever you named it I m the polar opposite of a tech person but award winning in straight academia 
len ratingtwo Minus IT as stated Feel fortunate to know when how where to plug in multiple light cords SO since everyone I have talked to n I talk to folks all day every day except Sunday afternoon literally intensely dislike CHROME AS IS yet p re ever Google luv working w Cloud Sister notimgy distress bought an expensive iPhone ugh always had Android took college HOURS after X grad school just n deciding first initial smartphone 
len ratingtwo GOOGLE Anyone 
len ratingtwo Assistance please 
len ratingtwo Suggestions 
len ratingtwo gift
len ratingone Ever since this this last update it keeps crashing someone please fix 
len ratingone iOS and iPhone plus
len ratingone I don t want Safari I want Google Chrome 
len ratingthree The main reason I would use the chrome browser on all my apple devices rather than the safari one is because I hated safari s layout 
len ratingthree But now chrome looks just like it 
len ratingthree I want the old look back 
len ratingone  Scrap this design like you re scrapping Inbox 
len ratingone Go back to how it was before being able to close tabs with a swipe was way better 
len ratingone At least offer a setting to use the old better layout 
len ratingone Try listening to your customers and don t be evil 
len ratingone  Update visit chrome flags and choose disable under UI Refresh to avoid the following issue 
len ratingone Still one star as I m afraid this won t always be an option 
len ratingone Saved the app s utility for now though 
len ratingone  This app used to be a wonderful alternative to the native browser 
len ratingone Recently it s been retooled and amazingly has managed to become a worse version of said native app 
len ratingone Chrome went from being my favorite browser to my hands down least favorite browser in the space of one update 
len ratingone Impressive really 
len ratingone To say I m wildly disappointed would be an understatement but to say that I m finally done with Google products after this experience would be quite accurate 
len ratingone I ve used Google services since the launch of Gmail but it s time for me to say so long Chrome and so long Google I ll miss what you once were but I won t regret leaving behind what you ve become 
len ratingone No me gusta el nuevo update que le hicieron se frisa demasiado 
len ratingone I would never have updated my browser had I known the navigation buttons would move to the bottom 
len ratingone If I d wanted them there I would have used the browser that came with my phone 
len ratingone If you want to have it as an option to put the buttons at the bottom that s fine but don t force me to have them there 
len ratingone Please either change it back or have a user setting to let me change it back 
len ratingone It s unnatural and wrong 
len ratingtwo I don t like using safari because they have the search bar and everything else split 
len ratingtwo I liked chrome because everything was in one place at the top since I never turned my automatic updates off my chrome was updated unfortunately 
len ratingtwo Please give the option back to the old layout 
len ratingfive Why you guys charge for this app that s bad
len ratingfive I always hated how the address bar and all of the controls used to be at the top of the screen 
len ratingfive It s a pain to reach especially on larger screened phones 
len ratingfive With this update everything is within reach of my thumb which is way more intuitive and user friendly than the old version 
len ratingfive The settings also appear to be streamlined as well so bravo 
len ratingfour id like to be able to watch webm files
len ratingone I could drone on for hours about how great chrome has always been hey google 
len ratingone Are you listening 
len ratingone This new tab system and layout is absolute pure garbage 
len ratingone I would love to give this browser stars if I could 
len ratingone PUT IT BACK FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY 
len ratingtwo I just opened Chrome on my smartphone and thought what s going on I thought that it maybe was a glitch so I restarted the phone and still came up as Safari Chrome 
len ratingtwo I hate Safari so is there a setting that I can click to give me back the Chrome I prefer to use 
len ratingtwo Who thought that Safari Chrome was a good idea 
len ratingtwo Yuck
len ratingone This is ridiculous I touch get it goes through all sorts of things says I now have Google Chrome but I can t see anything I can t view what I m trying to view and I absolutely hate it
len ratingthree Google chrome is my favorite app but after last update lots of things stop working 
len ratingthree Now I can t watch videos 
len ratingfive Hi Google team I m not sure why this is happening but currently browsing through some pages and searches the app has consumed of my battery s life in minutes 
len ratingfive Even opening after closing all other apps and opening chrome to view the opening page used up down to while on low battery mode 
len ratingfive My phone has at most run other apps today 
len ratingfive By some deduction I found that chrome was responsible for the unusually high battery consumption 
len ratingfive Please feel free to contact me for any other follow up questions 
len ratingfive This seems to be a disturbingly odd for a browser s behavior 
len ratingfive Chrome is great it has everything you would need in real life texting calling writing group writing anything you would want
len ratingfive  Like
len ratingone  This app used to be a wonderful alternative to the native browser 
len ratingone Recently it s been retooled and amazingly has managed to become a worse version of said native app 
len ratingone Chrome went from being my favorite browser to my hands down least favorite browser in the space of one update 
len ratingone Impressive really 
len ratingone To say I m wildly disappointed would be an understatement but to say that I m finally done with Google products after this experience would be quite accurate 
len ratingone I ve used Google services since the launch of Gmail but it s time for me to say so long Chrome and so long Google 
len ratingone I ll miss what you once were but I won t regret leaving behind what you ve become 
len ratingtwo why change a sleek all intuitive layout into all the things i hated about safari 
len ratingone After I updated chrome to the new version it has been slacking 
len ratingone The new design is trash and clumsy I fish I could go back to the old design were it was running fast and smoothly 
len ratingone I don t recommend updating
len ratingone Dang 
len ratingone Has been running stable for literally months before today s update 
len ratingone Now I lost all my tabs and I can t even save one before it locks and crashes again 
len ratingone Newer updates have destroyed Chrome 
len ratingone When looking at pictures you used to be able to turn your phone sideways landscape and it would make it full screen 
len ratingone Not anymore 
len ratingone Then when you try to zoom in on it the picture sometimes gets stuck blown up and you can t do anything 
len ratingone Can t even close the page until it decides to unfreeze itself 
len ratingfive  Thanks
len ratingfive Thank you the redesign 
len ratingfive I love it and is well thought out 
len ratingfive Finally switched from safari to Chrome full time 
len ratingthree So freaking slow man 
len ratingthree Simply copying and pasting takes a second longer for a single url god forbid copying a sites html it takes foreverrrrr 
len ratingthree It s not just that though 
len ratingthree Everything seems buggy as heck for me 
len ratingthree Still using though 
len ratingthree Hoping for this new update to fix these issues which is downloading as i write this 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree Update Still slow 
len ratingthree oh well 
len ratingthree back to practice fortnite dances 
len ratingone  What did you guys do 
len ratingone Why mess up a perfect app 
len ratingone Omg 
len ratingone Go back on this update
len ratingtwo I don t know what s causing this but it has been happening durning the latest updates 
len ratingtwo Please look into this problem 
len ratingone I have two devices and one updated and that no longer works I have deleted and re installed twice 
len ratingone The older version works perfect 
len ratingone please fix the new version by rolling back to 
len ratingthree What happened to swipe to close tabs 
len ratingthree Now there s a button to everything and I have to move my fingers so much more than previously 
len ratingthree How is this not an obvious UX regression 
len ratingthree I am so confused 
len ratingthree None of the new changes made things better for me 
len ratingone Doesn t progress on retail sights 
len ratingone Repeated entries of name and address and cc s 
len ratingone Totally a wasted minutes of my time 
len ratingone  Hi there Sorry you are having issues with autofill could you let us know on which website you experienced that problem 
len ratingtwo Live basically given us Safari 
len ratingtwo Nobody asked for this 
len ratingtwo For people trying to fix this open a new tab and go to chrome flags 
len ratingtwo Then scroll until you find UI Refresh Phase 
len ratingtwo Disable that and then relaunch chrome 
len ratingtwo You should have the old chrome look back 
len ratingthree It s better than using safari when safari doesn t work 
len ratingthree Altho I wish you could use extensions just like you could on a pc 
len ratingthree Blocking pop ups would be a lot better and being able to add additional add ones would be nice
len ratingfive I am going home 
len ratingfive Literally I bought this years ago 
len ratingfive Now my family has found me 
len ratingthree If I wanted Chrome to be like Safari I would just use Safari 
len ratingthree Personally don t like the new version 
len ratingthree  Please add the download manager to this application
len ratingfive Love it google and safari are the same but you shouldn t judge whoever wrote that safari is bad and that google should change 
len ratingone I don t care for safari 
len ratingone And now chrome is safari 
len ratingone Horrible update 
len ratingone Please fix it or i will have to find a new web browser 
len ratingone A dramatic change and not in a good way 
len ratingfour This app used to be worth while but now despite the updated UI the apps key features are gone rendering this app irrelevant 
len ratingfour The absence of features like auto updating passwords and the inability to customize homepage to your liking are a huge deal breaker for this browser 
len ratingfour If it ain t broke don t fix it 
len ratingone  Lazada only sells junk and Chinese made copies of the real thing 
len ratingone Lazada has sent me a broken TV and changed me shipping costs when shipping was supposed to be free 
len ratingone The latest scam in addition to increasing the price and charging shipping cost during the final checkout step is the switch and sell scam 
len ratingone Lazada will provide a photo of an item for sale and switch and send you a much cheaper item 
len ratingone A lot of times the item will appear to be normal size in the photo and Lazada will ship you a much smaller piece 
len ratingone Sometimes Lazada will even switch the item to a doll house sided item 
len ratingone You may think you are buying regular sized dishes based on the photo and description and Lazada will send you dishes for a doll house 
len ratingone Same for coffee cups chairs shelves fish food etc 
len ratingone In other cases Lazada will send you a totally different item from the one in the photo 
len ratingone In my case the photo showed a coffee maker with free shipping 
len ratingone Lazada sent me a coffee spoon and charged shipping costs 
len ratingone This scam is considered a crime in most free countries like Canada United States and most countries in Europe 
len ratingone I would like to know where the Philippines Department of Justice stands on this scam 
len ratingone Why aren t Lazada management held accountable for the items they sell 
len ratingone I wish I didn t update 
len ratingone So many website crashes 
len ratingone Title says it all 
len ratingone I don t want to be one of those people who hates change but the aesthetics of the new update is trash 
len ratingone Chrome should try to be Apple because it s better 
len ratingone I don t know if it is due to a recent update but today I lost all my open tabs 
len ratingone My Recent Tabs or recently closed tabs section is also empty 
len ratingone And I can t don t see the history from ONLY my iPhone other devices are broken out by device 
len ratingone This new My Activity doesn t let you sort filter chrome history by device 
len ratingone After an extensive forum search this is happening to others with no solution to get the tabs back 
len ratingone Please fix this Google 
len ratingtwo The new gif feature is cool to play plenty but two problems occur 
len ratingtwo One you will often just get confused with it and a whole slew will play 
len ratingtwo Two you can t click on them and see other suggested gifs or similar gifs below 
len ratingtwo If you can add a feature where you can toggle the gif setting that d be amazing 
len ratingfour Whatever happen to them 
len ratingfour Did you remove that feature or did I miss a setting for it 
len ratingtwo This new update is fugly 
len ratingtwo It reminds of the year the world was supposed to end 
len ratingtwo Fix it
len ratingone I use Chrome on iOS 
len ratingone This new version renders it all but unusable 
len ratingone The way tabs display is effectively useless insofar as a user cannot easily scroll through multiple tabs and see their basic title content at least not on an iPhone 
len ratingone  Please make it look like Chrome for Android 
len ratingone This iOS version of Chrome is so bad 
len ratingone Not only ugly but hard to navigate 
len ratingone Closing or switching tabs is not user friendly at all 
len ratingone Updates are meant to make apps better you re update is the worse I have ever seen 
len ratingone You took something good amp mess it up 
len ratingone Bye for a long long time 
len ratingone Info is in there 
len ratingone Wont auto fill for CL C Card info anymore 
len ratingone Useless to me 
len ratingone  Hi there Sorry you are having issues with autofill could you let us know on which website you experienced that problem 
len ratingone Please make the old app design optional not a fan of the new theme 
len ratingone Looks like the Great Value version of Safari 
len ratingone Searches not as good 
len ratingone Hard to navigate

len ratingfive  Great App 
len ratingone Bloated with garbage news on the new tab page yes you can opt out but it should be opt in and can t go a day without crashing and closing all incognito tabs 
len ratingone That s typical of low quality Google software 
len ratingone Not to mention it probably has hidden spyware and backdoors in it given Google s track record for privacy and how Chrome is even if Chromium isn t closed source and proprietary 
len ratingone Stay away from Chrome and other low quality Google spyware 
len ratingfour Yhh
len ratingone I normally do not write reviews but this new update is HORRIBLE 
len ratingone Every time I try to upload a document it kicks me out 
len ratingone I expect better from google you guys really let me down with this one 
len ratingthree Not sure what happened but autofill no longer works 
len ratingthree That was the best part about using this browser 
len ratingthree Now it s just as useless as the Safari browser 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone Good to know you can t download images 
len ratingone Safari already prevents it 
len ratingone I had to abandon safari 
len ratingone I m going to try out some other browsers since Google decided to update Chrome and make it a slower Safari look alike 
len ratingone I have used Chrome for years on both Android and Apple devices because it was different and intuitive 
len ratingone That is no longer the case 
len ratingone Google you re better than this 
len ratingone Stole safari s layout but made it even less user friendly didn t know that was possible 
len ratingone Tried to avoid this update honestly think my finger slipped pressed update accidentally I m so disappointed 
len ratingone It s T E R R I B L E 
len ratingtwo This new update is frustrating 
len ratingtwo At some points there is literally so back button so I have to reenter a web address in order to retrace my steps 
len ratingtwo This is like a crap version of safari which at this point I d use that instead of this mess
len ratingone Auto fill auto passwords no longer works now since new update please fix 
len ratingone  remove swipe down reload plzz 
len ratingfive  Up you tube I spy with my little eye something white and red it s you tube 
len ratingfive  I love the redesign 
len ratingfive One tiny thing that bothers me is that there is no way that I can tell to clear browsing history when you have no tabs open 
len ratingfive You have to open a tab and then go to the menu on the bottom right 
len ratingfive I habitually close all of my tabs before clearing browsing history so having to open up a tab again to erase the history gets a bit annoying 
len ratingfive Otherwise perfect 
len ratingfive I love the search button in the bottom middle 
len ratingone Used to be a good app 
len ratingone But now I have to log into every gmail and it won t save my passwords like it used to 
len ratingone Went from stars to Star 
len ratingone After the most recent update I m suddenly unable to watch any embedded videos on my iPad 
len ratingone They still work just fine on Safari so it obviously is a problem with Chrome 
len ratingone  And the devs don t care 
len ratingfour  Ssg zvd fbsfzst ja vmb gensstzz
len ratingone Trash only acts like a google search bar instead of an address bar 
len ratingone I used google chrome primarily because it was easy to navigate and didn t look like safari 
len ratingone So imagine my shock when I updated the app only to find that it now looks far too similar to safari and is impossible to use 
len ratingone  I m this isn t a problem I have often please go back 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingthree My main issue with chrome has been that pop ups come up frequently and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app just to get rid of it 
len ratingthree There should be a way of removing the tab without having to completely uninstalling the app 
len ratingone I have used this as my browser of choice for many years 
len ratingone The new update however is absolutely horrific 
len ratingone I downloaded this because I hated Safari but it is now looking a lot like Safari functioning even worse 
len ratingone The back arrow being at the bottom of the screen is awful 
len ratingone The way to navigate between open windows is awful 
len ratingone I ended up downloading and am now using DuckDuckGo for my browser 
len ratingone It is not a browser I love but it is vastly superior to the new chrome 
len ratingone Are you serious 
len ratingone ALL MY PASSWORDS SAVED ARE GONE 
len ratingone Wow 
len ratingone I m not happy at all 
len ratingone I have never likes safari and now that s exactly what I have 
len ratingone Why would you change the complete format of google 
len ratingone I don t understand that 
len ratingone Over all I m not a fan and now I m going to have to find something new 
len ratingone  The new design is just another example of streamlining that ends up looking fuckugly 
len ratingone The app ends up looking like Safari at least give us the option to stick with the old interface please 
len ratingfive I have been using this for a long time and I do look at some weird stuff online but this app is good for protection and it is very helpful 
len ratingone I was using Chrome after update on my iPad when I needed to upload a document to the healthcare gov website 
len ratingone I clicked on the button to select a file and selected a file I stored on my iCloud Drive 
len ratingone As soon as I did the app goes into the tab view showing all Chrome tabs as very small icons 
len ratingone There was no way to select the image to maximize the tab I was working on 
len ratingone And even though it was much too small to see I tried working on the site in that view but was very unsuccessful 
len ratingone At the top right of that view was the word Done which I thought might take me back to the normal view 
len ratingone But touching Done did absolutely nothing 
len ratingone I do not know what else may be wrong with this new tab view but it certainly appears testing was lacking 
len ratingone You guys usually do very good work so I know you ll make efforts to correct this issue 
len ratingone Doing so quickly will be greatly appreciated 
len ratingone The best thing about this update is how unintuitive it is and it s sheer ability to make me install Firefox as my main browser moving forward 
len ratingone Thanks Google 
len ratingone I used to love the google chrome app but now I hate the new layout with the recent update 
len ratingone It s much harder to navigate and I hate having to look down and access a the tab page or the settings 
len ratingone The previous layout was just like how you would use it on a desktop 
len ratingone So much easier and much more aesthetically pleasing to look at 
len ratingone I hope they change it back 
len ratingone The way the app used to work was perfect 
len ratingone I hate this new skin and i hate that i can t swipe out of tabs now 
len ratingone Please change it back or allow this skin to be an option 
len ratingthree Swipe to close a tab is not available anymore 
len ratingthree Before I can read offline files as many as I want 
len ratingthree With this update I have to read ONE and if I go back it takes buttload to see the previous offline page 
len ratingthree Please go back to the previous update
len ratingone  This new update is totally not useful 
len ratingone I wonder who approves such design for a product that is totally not usr friendly 
len ratingone Wishing to get back old design 
len ratingone UI UX designers please take community feedback before enforcing the visual changes 
len ratingone The new update had done away with the neat file folder look to open webpages 
len ratingone Instead it tiles the open pages in teeny tiny thumbnails that look years old 
len ratingone Please allow users the option to waterfall open pages instead of the mandatory tiles 
len ratingone The new design itself is not my issue 
len ratingone My issue is the size 
len ratingone Why is everything so big 
len ratingone It s like iPhone s zoomed display size but worse 
len ratingone The UI is even larger 
len ratingone I m writing from an iPhone XS Max 
len ratingone I m not sure if this is the reason why 
len ratingone My display zoom is set to standard 
len ratingone But I refuse to use this app with huge everything 
len ratingone Double tap on clock to back to top of the page there is it 
len ratingone As much as I love the Google chrome app the newest overhaul on the app s design completely destroys the reason I chose to install it in the first place 
len ratingone It looks like a rip off of the Safari app but with larger buttons 
len ratingone The choice to add everything besides the search tab to the bottom of the screen takes up way too much space on my SE and it s extremely distracting 
len ratingone If I wanted the navigation menu at the bottom I will just use safari 
len ratingone Removing from phone and seeing a different alternative
len ratingfive This is AMAZING
len ratingtwo Hoping you can take back the new update 
len ratingtwo The app is crashing after minute of use no matter the website 
len ratingtwo Not like Mario Smooth interface 
len ratingtwo righteously a 
len ratingtwo There now Less speed than most browsers now there is anti privacy features added a bit ago plus you are opted to stay signed in to use chrome safely as of one of the x xx patches Works great with catholic forums answers Now has an added feature of exiting out every seconds as do most web browsers except cloud browse few others I can read a lot about the beauty tradition and magnificence of the catholic church 
len ratingtwo And grow stronger and more knowledgeable about my faith Since it is one of the required things to do after confirmation 
len ratingtwo Shalom God bless y all 
len ratingone Used to be great 
len ratingone Don t like the update 
len ratingone Now it looks the same as safari
len ratingtwo I hate the new design 
len ratingtwo It s like a comic sans safari 
len ratingtwo Ugh 
len ratingtwo Guess I ll just go back to safari since space is limited on my phone and I prefer the less bubbly and juvenile look of safari 
len ratingtwo I loved the app before and it worked beautifully but I m a visual person and this is awful 
len ratingtwo Left Chrome due to the new design but I came back 
len ratingtwo I despise the new tab picker screen but the rest of everything is mostly okay to me now 
len ratingtwo If they d revert the tab picker then I d be pretty happy 
len ratingtwo Closing a tab causes everything on the left and right sides below the closed tab to switch sides and it s very annoying 
len ratingtwo The old stacked cards layout was easier and prettier 
len ratingtwo Or at least give us the option between the two 
len ratingtwo I d also like the menu to go further up the screen 
len ratingtwo I use Find in Page very often and having to scroll down to get to it is annoying when the menu could simply be made taller to make things more readily available 
len ratingtwo But that s more of a minor nuisance 
len ratingtwo The tab picker is still despicable to me 
len ratingone Laggy trash
len ratingfour  Please bring back the notification bar in iOS version 
len ratingfour There is no point in showing what website the person is on We know what we are surfing reading 
len ratingfour Having time visible in the notification bar is more important 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use Safari I d have never downloaded Chrome 
len ratingtwo The new update takes a useful functional app and takes it back to a useless piece of software not unlike your recent gmail update 
len ratingthree  Interesting innovative browser but the interface is complex and often unintuitive Firefox handles interface complexity better Safari does simple and elegant better 
len ratingthree Both are more private 
len ratingthree Bookmarks are particularly baroque 
len ratingthree Google says they keep your sync data safe from prying eyes and I would generally believe them up until the latest Google fiasco which they handled extremely poorly 
len ratingthree But since they also data mine your online activity you re clearly not safe from THEM 
len ratingthree People enmeshed in the Google universe will use this product 
len ratingthree For the rest of us look around 
len ratingthree There are more private and more elegant alternatives 
len ratingfive It doe look a bit like Safari which I hate 
len ratingfive but in all honesty it runs way smoother and much faster than safari 
len ratingfive Not a big fan of the menu placements but switching tabs is easy as heck now 
len ratingfive  It was already easy just more so now 
len ratingfour Will you guys create a USDZ viewer for your app 
len ratingfour I know shopify and other are getting in the game for usdz and it would be cool to not be confined to safari 
len ratingfour Also safari doesn t cater the vertical plane yet so there s a way to pull ahead of them 
len ratingone  Keep making this worse with every update 
len ratingone Why can t you fix it it s freezing crashing bottom tabs are annoying memory and battery hog too 
len ratingone Remember when Google was innovative 
len ratingtwo The new style is horrible 
len ratingtwo I used Chrome because it wasn t like Safari and now it s worse than Safari 
len ratingtwo I don t know why you would change how the whole app functions 
len ratingtwo I liked how it more or less matched the format of a web browser 
len ratingtwo Please change it back 
len ratingone Uglier and less intuitive 
len ratingone I miss the old version 
len ratingone The newest update has really put me off 
len ratingone Having that bar that appears at the bottom of the screen is honestly the worst thing aesthetically I have ever seen 
len ratingone Having a bar at the bottom is why I would never use Safari but is also why I m not going to be switching off of Chrome 
len ratingone Please give us the option to not have a bar at the bottom 
len ratingone I really liked using Chrome but I can t deal with this visual change 
len ratingthree  I love the new design 
len ratingthree The tabs navigation will take a bit of time to get used to but something is wrong with the GIFS and yes I checked and both my phone and Chrome is up to date 
len ratingthree The problem is the GIFS are just turned into looped videos and I can t enlarge them or save them without reacting with lightning speed to do so 
len ratingthree This is a real pet peeve of mine I hope you will fix 
len ratingone i accidentally downloaded this new trash version i want the old on back or i m finding a new browser
len ratingone What a shame that Google has changed the layout of Chrome to a Safari clone 
len ratingone The first few times I opened it after the update I was confused as to why Safari kept opening I never use Safari 
len ratingone But then I realized 
len ratingone This new layout is less functional and harder to use with essential navigation tools split between two different areas on the screen 
len ratingone I d rather have it all in one place in the top bar as it was before easier to manage and much quicker to use 
len ratingone I really don t think Chrome should be striving to match others in the industry it should be setting and maintaining a higher standard which it had but has given up for some strange reason 
len ratingone This is a step in the wrong direction 
len ratingone May have to find another browser now 
len ratingthree The layout reminds me of the safari browser 
len ratingthree I need a downgrade button ASAP 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I wouldn t have installed chrome update is trash
len ratingone When I open a website to watch video it crashes
len ratingfive Awesome yooooooooo hggdhooooohvggggggggggggggghdisjcxxjshxhfsjxbxhxj
len ratingfive I absolutely love the new look of chrome as it is just more simplistic and the the multi tasking mode makes things so much easier 
len ratingfive This is something different which is great in my mind it s more of a browser made for the phone that works well with the display rather than safari for example which in my opinion was made just to access the internet and it doesn t work well whereas the new chrome is even better than it was before 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive  Forgot to say that I love the idea of all the utilities such as searching is at the bottom for easy access 
len ratingfive  D
len ratingone This new update is terrible 
len ratingone I use Chrome because Safari is such a garbage browser but now you made Chrome look just like Safari 
len ratingone Go back this version is the absolute worst 
len ratingone I ve exclusively used chrome on iPhone for years 
len ratingone Mainly because of the ability to view desktop versions of websites which you can t do in safari 
len ratingone The second to last update I liked because the new tab view and the ability to rearrange them was a wonderful added feature 
len ratingone But the newest update has made this browser unusable for me 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Because when I am in the images section for a search query I can t click on an image and view a larger version 
len ratingone Now the only option is to click on the website link below to image to bring me to the originating page to view the image there 
len ratingone For the first time I m going to have to use safari as my main browser until this is fixed 
len ratingone it was great before you ruined it with the current update 
len ratingone way to go 
len ratingfive It s better than dial up 
len ratingfive Lol
len ratingtwo I use to love my chrome app 
len ratingtwo Not anymore 
len ratingtwo This new update makes Chrome look like everything that I hate about Safari 
len ratingtwo You Google folks could and should have done better 
len ratingtwo Please don t make the same or even similar changes to the desktop app
len ratingthree This app has issues with freezing and locking up my phone that a hard restart needs to happen and because the app didn t properly shut down you lose all of your tabs 
len ratingthree How annoying 
len ratingthree Many friends report the same while using chrome this just happened same day it updated 
len ratingthree Provide options for tabs to be in list view to select 
len ratingthree The thumbnails are quite annoying 
len ratingthree Much easier to scroll through a list like Safari 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone Uninstalled and reinstalled the app messed with my settings cleared cache etc 
len ratingone Didn t matter 
len ratingone The updated Chrome app continued to crash every single time i tried to open a website 
len ratingone This wasn t a problem before the update 
len ratingone Have deleted chrome and will be using shudder Safari 
len ratingone Great job google 
len ratingone Since you re all clearly intent on jacking other software s style I thought this title might catch your attention 
len ratingone This new interface is a hot pile of garbage 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would use Safari 
len ratingone Seriously guys 
len ratingone The old stystem with the search bar and dots to open settings was classic Google style and easy to use 
len ratingone No idea what in fresh heck is going on now 
len ratingone Honestly stop trying to change the aesthetics and work on stopping those stupidly annoying CLEARLY A VIRUS popups 
len ratingfour  Would love to see google allow tracking prevention even as an opt in method 
len ratingone Everyone is exactly right 
len ratingone It s the worst update ever 
len ratingone And yes looks like Safari but much WORSE 
len ratingone I used Chrome because it was so easy but now it s horrible time consuming and unusable 
len ratingone I ll be using anything else till this monstrosity is fixed 
len ratingone Wish I d never updated but who could have predicted some idiot would ruin something that worked so great 
len ratingthree  You should have extensions in chrome As well as that pop up blocker for Google Chrome is horrible I get them constantly so I beg you please fix this because I keep getting a pop up ads that I can t quit so I have to re install Google Chrome from the App Store every time that happens
len ratingtwo bad browser 
len ratingtwo Used to be really good but it s so heavy and clunky to run now it s terrible 
len ratingfive We had an excellent trip and appreciate our driver waiting for us to get to the gate as he was unable to enter the base at Dover 
len ratingfive He should know for next time to go to the visitor center and wait which is just before the security check point 
len ratingone i loved it way before i updated 
len ratingone worst decision of my life 
len ratingone i like chrome because of it s differences from safari but obviously chrome adores them to the fullest 
len ratingone did you seriously have to turn it into an exact replica 
len ratingone sure it s not the same but 
len ratingone really 
len ratingone it was seriously fine the way it was 
len ratingone not everything needs an update for christ sakes 
len ratingfive Love the new update thank you really Google 
len ratingfive The previous version I was having a problem which is the app font is big when you re using the latest iPhone phone like iPhone X s Max but this update fixed the issue 
len ratingone  Chrome and Google will not log me in to my work account without manual entry for name the site needs domain username which Google s apps will not retain and then an old password is offered by Google 
len ratingone Safari and Edge log in flawlessly 
len ratingone Useless app for me 
len ratingone Someone at Google needs to wake up 
len ratingthree Browser is completely good but the desktop site option isn t working 
len ratingone I ll be completely honest I don t like this layout it looks gross and it just isn t as easy and simple as the old one I don t like how I have to get to the tabs and I don t like the tab set up in general who s ever idea it was to accept and launch this plan has no common sense
len ratingone Chrome was once the best browser available but thanks to the new update it s no better than Safari 
len ratingone Except Safari ACTUALLY PLAYS VIDEOS so really Chrome is basically useless at this point 
len ratingone Call me up when you revert from this atrocious excuse for an update and I ll consider redownloading 
len ratingone The latest update has made it to where I can t watch YouTube anymore I can t get on my account watch videos or connect to my live stream 
len ratingtwo Dictation io doesn t work with Chrome even after deleting my existing app and reinstalling 
len ratingthree  I don t know what y all Google we re think with this new update 
len ratingthree I hate it 
len ratingthree It reminds me of a ancient old broken down Safari and I use Google Chrome because I don t like Safari see where I m going with this 
len ratingthree Please bring back the old Google Chrome or at least make this version better because you all went backwards with this update in my opinion 
len ratingthree I ll give you stars because you re Google and at least you re trying 
len ratingthree  I just wanted to add something because I saw a comment about it AFTER I had posted my review 
len ratingthree As soon as I opened Chrome I thought it was Safari for a while until I looked and wondered why I thought my Safari app had moved positions on my iPhone when it didn t then I immediately went on here to post a review I don t leave many reviews for everything but was a little ticked when I kept thinking that I was accidentally opening Safari when it was actually Chrome 
len ratingthree So for the one or more ppl that says that each reviewer must have read other reviews and copied them saying that it looks like Safari I can attest that is not the case and if I thought it was Safari immediately without even reading any reviews then I m sure many others on here did as well 
len ratingone At first I thought my year old did something with my browser settings 
len ratingone I tried hard to restore back to previous settings even uninstalled a downloaded chrome app again just to find out that it s new updated version 
len ratingone It s bad as can be 
len ratingone Tab list at the bottom of the page is very inconvenient as well as a tab list 
len ratingone It s very confusing visually 
len ratingone Please bring back previous layout 
len ratingone I never against updates and always looking forward to something new that makes life better 
len ratingone But this version of chrome isn t better in any way and I am already looking for other alternatives to chrome chrome was my favorite browser since it was launched 
len ratingone Just keep it simple and stop adding junk Wow looking dumb down now To easy to make mistakes now
len ratingfive This is one of my favorite iOS apps 
len ratingfive Everything works well and looks great 
len ratingfive Keeps my CC info stored and passwords just as on desktop version 
len ratingfive Switching between browser windows is slick and well done 
len ratingfive A app for sure 
len ratingfive Thanks to the developers 
len ratingthree New UI is good 
len ratingthree But I can t use password in my google account 
len ratingthree  There is bug to be fixed 
len ratingfive When you will support the H codec known as HEVC on IOS phone devices to play videos kfps accurately on YouTube and Chrome browser 
len ratingthree Thanks for the last update Google it close all my open web browsers 
len ratingone Installed Chrome on my work phone 
len ratingone I have never logged in to Chrome sync on my work phone 
len ratingone Shocker it has figured out what my account is because I logged in to youtube and it started pulling history and auto fill from Chrome on my home PC 
len ratingone It never asked me to do this and even after clearing data logging out the auto fill and account suggestion was still there 
len ratingone Mind you this is a work phone 
len ratingone You put two and two together 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome 
len ratingone The decreasing level of control I have over you and constant problems with performance and now privacy 
len ratingone Firefox for me from now on 
len ratingone Google can no longer be trusted don t be evil is gone you are beyond creepy and evil now 
len ratingfive I ve tried other browsers and Google by far is the best 
len ratingfive I never have to worry about my information being stored whether it be from loss of phone or whatever the reason I know my pics files documents etc 
len ratingfive I don t have to worry 
len ratingfive Better and better everyday Thank you and keep up the good work Christine
len ratingthree The new update won t allow me to submit a word document as a file for my school website 
len ratingthree I don t know what s going on 
len ratingone I ve already deleted mine 
len ratingone I ll be looking for another one 
len ratingone Put it back to how it was if you want anyone to keep using chrome 
len ratingfive I liked all the visual changes in the latest update 
len ratingfive The bottom bar is easier to reach 
len ratingfive The magnifier icon brings the address bar so that you don t have to reach up 
len ratingfive The tab tiles are more informative that the tab folders 
len ratingfive The tab folders were just visual effect gimmicks 
len ratingfive Having bookmarks in the new tab makes a lot of sense 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Chrome doesn t lag and it is very easy on the go 
len ratingfive I like it because if I try to search dsokids it tells me that website steals information
len ratingthree Two or three clicks to add a new tab 
len ratingthree Hmm 
len ratingfive I ve been a chrome user since the iPhone came out 
len ratingfive Been loving it ever since 
len ratingfive Desktop and incognito mode is the only reason I will never use any other browser 
len ratingone Are you crazy 
len ratingone The new design is trash safari clone 
len ratingone I hate Safari now I hate chrome too thanks 
len ratingone My eyes are bleed 
len ratingone After the data breach of Google records and not disclosing the breach I ve finally accepted that Google is no more than a data gathering company 
len ratingone I had pretty much ceased to use anything Google because of the data gathering issue 
len ratingone The data breach and non disclosure just sealed the deal for me 
len ratingone I m laughing at the other negative reviews 
len ratingone I JUST replaced my Samsung tablet with an iPad Pro so naturally I downloaded Chrome to check it out 
len ratingone It s worthless 
len ratingone As somebody else said why would I use this over Safari 
len ratingone I wouldn t 
len ratingone Really 
len ratingone I loved chrome so badly as it was so easy to use 
len ratingone New version is too difficult to use 
len ratingfour Great app by when i press the open in feature on a pdf it doesn t work 
len ratingfour I am unable to save the pdf on my iPad files 
len ratingfour it would be great if this bug was fixed 
len ratingfour  I love Google s design overhaul 
len ratingfour It s very aesthetically pleasing now and very seamless to go from the rounded corners of the home screen apps or messages to Chrome 
len ratingfour I m very sensitive to visual aesthetics being that I have sensory processing sensitivity and it helps me a ton 
len ratingfour It s just very gorgeous overall too and everything is meticulously designed to be in the most efficient place in my opinion especially the search button right in the middle as most of us go straight to Google for so many things first 
len ratingfour Now onto the issue 
len ratingfour I can no longer simply copy an image which is very odd 
len ratingfour I can only save an image now 
len ratingfour I very frequently use Safari s ability to copy images 
len ratingfour I m not sure if this is due to Google s issue with Getty Images and taking away the view image feature which I myself found a way around a purposeful intention to prevent direct copying of images or a design flaw but either way it makes me have to continue using Safari for the time being because of how often I use that simple feature 
len ratingthree I love the app but I m not a fan of the new close all tabs button being where the add tab button was in previous versions 
len ratingthree I ve lost a lot of tabs with that simple error 
len ratingfive I m Kill was playingduk in my or
len ratingone If Chrome can t block pop ups and auto play what good is it 
len ratingone App refuses to open on my iPhone 
len ratingone I have been a long time chrome user because I hate the separate navigation and address bar safari has 
len ratingone I loved the fact that chrome had bar it was simpler 
len ratingone Why did google not provide an option to have bar 
len ratingone I used chrome because of the UI and I am deleting it now because it now is a clone of safri s UI 
len ratingtwo Why break something that worked perfectly fine 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use a clone of Safari I d just use Safari 
len ratingtwo Guess we ll either get used to it or use something else 
len ratingone The latest version of chrome is absolute trash 
len ratingone It s upsetting because it wasn t trash before the update 
len ratingone Now I have to deal with freezing malicious ads that lead to the same malicious site regardless of what website I m visiting stuck back buttons that don t work softbuttons on websites that don t work and other random debilitating issues that I didn t have to deal with before the update 
len ratingone Google absolutely ruined their app with this last update 
len ratingone Now I have to switch to Firefox or safari 
len ratingfive Looks like safari
len ratingone Why doesn t Google add a Read view as both Safari and Firefox have done 
len ratingone It s a glaring omission at this point 
len ratingone Can we assume that it s because it would cut into their bread and butter ad revenue 
len ratingtwo  The cosmetic changes make it more difficult for me to use the app 
len ratingtwo I guess I am going back to safari for work 
len ratingone So annoying that you can t stop history tracking in regular mode default the app to open all links in incognito mode only 
len ratingone If you hate safari you ll hate the decreased functionality of this newly garbage app 
len ratingfive It was squishy
len ratingfive  A lot of times I wonder what the difference is between Google and Chrome 
len ratingfive I feel that Google is more original than Chrome but that s just my opinion 
len ratingfive It s definitely not in my place to be SUPER judgmental about it and be really rude but I feel these two apps are kind of 
len ratingfive THE SAME 
len ratingfive There s nothing that stands out in one app that doesn t stand out in the other 
len ratingfive If I closed my eyes and tapped one of the apps other than the fact that Chrome takes you to a page I honestly don t think I d know if it was Google or Chrome 
len ratingfive Anyway I don t really have any MAJOR problems with this app not any that need to be pointed out 
len ratingfive But I really like this app 
len ratingfive It s very helpful with practically EVERYTHING and I enjoy using it whenever I need to 
len ratingtwo I understand it s necessary to move forward and make changes to the app but really this overhaul was not needed and frankly unwanted 
len ratingtwo IMO the old tabs were way better and I m not a fan of things on the bottom of the screen now 
len ratingtwo But you know how to make all users happy 
len ratingtwo ADD MULTIPLE OPTIONS 
len ratingtwo I should be able to go back to the old layout if I want to just saying 
len ratingone Come on now the last design was great and felt like a real web browser on the phone 
len ratingone now the app looks and feels just like Safari which is by far he worst web browser on the market 
len ratingtwo Used to love it But now it won t stop crashing
len ratingtwo So disappointed that they changed the UI to look like Safari 
len ratingtwo Why bother having Chrome now 
len ratingone Worst update ever 
len ratingone It s like your software designers are Teletubbies recently converted to ISIS members 
len ratingone I can t copy and paste a URL 
len ratingone It looks like a rd grader designed the new font 
len ratingone You re the same people who ruined toyota with your bubble shape fetish 
len ratingfive Love the new UI and article suggestions on the front page 
len ratingfive  Ward was a pleasure to work with as I made this transfer 
len ratingfive My first time to switch since cellphones came out
len ratingtwo I liked Google Chromes layout way more than Safari layout and now it s been updated to look the same 
len ratingtwo Not a fan 
len ratingtwo Bring back the old classic layout 
len ratingfive  YouTube resolution options are not available on the browser in iphone devices
len ratingone  With the ad blocking and other extensions readily available for the desktop version along with the excellent bookmark and history browsing syncing I think Chrome is the best however the IOS version leaves out most of that and is but a shell of the desktop version 
len ratingone And there s no built in reader like in Safari no synced reading lists from desktop to mobile and vice versa the IOS version needs a LOT of work 
len ratingfive  Thanos car
len ratingone  Make it look like an iOS app again 
len ratingone If I wanted a bad design I would have bought an Android phone 
len ratingone Off to safari until chrome doesn t look like garbage anymore 
len ratingfive  Craig was extremely helpful 
len ratingfive He had a task to concur and he was patient and efficient doing so 
len ratingfive First time I had ever left with everything being resolved at 
len ratingfive  Quality options are not available for the browser on iphone Devices 
len ratingone  Nothing 
len ratingtwo I do not like the new platform at all 
len ratingtwo Please change it back 
len ratingtwo Or at least put the controls back at the top of the screen 
len ratingtwo Don t fix it if it isn t broke 
len ratingtwo Bad google 
len ratingtwo Its good when it works 
len ratingtwo When it crashes often I usually lose everything and can t always refresh my tabs history when I restart 
len ratingtwo Definitely prefer the old view better and not the new format 
len ratingtwo Needs to be an option within settings to change the themes or colors 
len ratingtwo I liked how the old one was dark this is too bright and the menu on top was not an issue for me 
len ratingfour The gift card winner pop up is really annoying 
len ratingfour I only browse legitimate websites but it keeps hijacking the browser 
len ratingfour It won t go away even after closing and opening quickly touching the search bar 
len ratingone I hate the new update 
len ratingone Made it feel like safari
len ratingone  I love using this app but the update has completely threw me off 
len ratingone I often use google and when I m scrolling down my fingers are always on the bottom of the screen and swiping things all the time 
len ratingone I read a lot and the new google update isn t helping 
len ratingone I prefer the old version where everything is on top of the screen where I can easily swipe up to hide and not accidentally click a button to go back or forth when I don t need to 
len ratingone I just want to know if there s anyway to downgrade the app 
len ratingone I also had over tabs open 
len ratingone I lost it all in an instant and have NO way of getting them back 
len ratingone I haven t the slightest clue what majority of the tabs were called and it s extremely difficult to try to find EVERYTHING all over again which I don t have time for 
len ratingone I need a section in which the tabs I have recently deleted ON ACCIDENT CAUSE IM NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY WILLINGLY DO THAT can be replaced in an instant 
len ratingone Without going into my history because let s be honest 
len ratingone History is a mix of what happened one one tab 
len ratingone NOT ON ALL TABS THAT WE HAD 
len ratingone It s really starting to annoy me by how google chrome is starting to fail 
len ratingtwo Looks too much like Safari if I wanted that format I d use Safari but I don t yet 
len ratingone Browser does not open after update
len ratingone I don t like my info being sold to rd parties 
len ratingone Absolutely horrifying 
len ratingone I used the new version for a few days to give it a chance 
len ratingone I like the way it looks but I hate everything else about it 
len ratingone What s with the GIANT real estate hogging search button 
len ratingone Are people really so lazy that they want this 
len ratingone It functions exactly the same as tapping the URL bar 
len ratingone Pointless waste of space 
len ratingone Put the reload button back in the toolbar please 
len ratingone Or somewhere at the top 
len ratingone There are plenty of places it could go 
len ratingone I really hate the new tab management page too 
len ratingone I miss that you can t swipe to close them 
len ratingone Feels extremely clunky 
len ratingone I don t mind the navigation being at the bottom and because of that I ve switched to Safari for the time being 
len ratingone Not happy about it as I ve previously avoided Safari like the plague but at least it has features I ll actually use 
len ratingone Can t say that about this latest Chrome update so goodbye 
len ratingfive Not sure why people are sniveling about the new update but the buttons on the bottom are WAYYYY easier to use than navigation at the top 
len ratingfive On any size device you can navigate pages with ONE HAND 
len ratingfive This is impossible with forward back buttons on the top 
len ratingtwo I mine as well switch to safari 
len ratingtwo Bring back the old design 
len ratingtwo Button at the top close pages etc 
len ratingone I deleted this app because I was continuously being redirected to a site that was obviously one of google s paid advertisers 
len ratingone Find a browser that doesn t track your every move 
len ratingone What you are looking for is always below an ad 
len ratingfour Right now there s no way to search within bookmark like in Safari 
len ratingfour But I think it s an easy feature to add
len ratingtwo I ve loved Chrome until the latest update 
len ratingtwo Now it s a complete battery drain even with no activity and background app refresh turned off 
len ratingthree Used to be better
len ratingthree  Not sure if it s the app or not but the websites I frequent the most alway slow down the app to a crawl and tend to kill my battery and cause my phone to over heat 
len ratingthree The only website that doesn t cause a slow down or battery drain that I go to often is YouTube 
len ratingtwo I love chrome 
len ratingtwo I gave it stars but let s be honest it s still the best browser out there 
len ratingtwo BUT this new update took a star rating and turned it into a Star 
len ratingtwo I abhor tr new layout 
len ratingtwo I stopped using safari precisely because I HATED the forward and back and all the function buttons for that matter buttons along the bottom of the screen 
len ratingtwo It makes zero sense to have address and navigation buttons in different places 
len ratingtwo Chrome had it beautifully placed 
len ratingtwo And what do they do 
len ratingtwo take steps back to do exactly what their competitors failed to move on from years ago 
len ratingtwo Their multiple tabs are not nearly as easily reached and navigated 
len ratingtwo Not tough to use at all but another definite step back in terms of intuitive design 
len ratingtwo I m not here telling you not to download it but for the LOVE OF GOD put stuff back where it belongs 
len ratingtwo Can we not fix this issue at his point 
len ratingtwo It s months since it hit the news feeds 
len ratingtwo I can no longer read name of tab because it is half as long now 
len ratingtwo See stuff like https that length makes a Huge difference 
len ratingtwo Very dissatisfied no option to choose or revert 
len ratingtwo Image preview not helpful as most tabs show nothing anyway or nothing helpful at least 
len ratingtwo Also very hard to tell if a page is already bookmarked or not 
len ratingtwo Absolutely hate the new update 
len ratingtwo Looks like safari 
len ratingtwo Terrible 
len ratingtwo Change it back 
len ratingone Save to Dropbox is being very temperamental 
len ratingone Trying to save PDFs only works some of the time 
len ratingone Chrome seems to be making it harder to clear cookies data 
len ratingone If I clear browsing data in a tab I had open I remain logged in everywhere 
len ratingone If I close my current tab and open a new tab in order to clear browsing data it appears to log me out and clear cookies most of the time but not always 
len ratingone This is with sync off for history tabs etc 
len ratingone Also saved search settings for do not save recent locations and do not auto play do not save despite me being logged on to my account 
len ratingone Those settings reset to Google defaults each time ie save recent locations becomes selected again 
len ratingone Clicking on clear locations either does nothing or takes me to a blank page 
len ratingtwo CSS transitions do not seem to work on transforms even when using WebKit vendor prefix 
len ratingthree But need a single button to access bookmarks 
len ratingthree Not a menu 
len ratingthree Safari at least can get to bookmarks easily 
len ratingtwo it s been on my phone now for several days and i don t like it 
len ratingtwo using google chrome used to be fun now it s more like an unpleasant to do task and get it over with as soon as possible 
len ratingone  Well it s time for me to switch browser to safari which is hassle free in saving and storing PDF documents 
len ratingone Chrome is really getting useless with every update 
len ratingone It s like they are more focused on the appearance of the app rather than the tools that we need to be productive
len ratingone Totally useless as a chrome browser when it can t do anything chrome for desktop can do 
len ratingone New design so ugly
len ratingtwo Loved design of old version I have this downloaded on iPhone but now the new version is like apples version of web search I can t wait to get rid of my iPhone and go back to android don t be like apple
len ratingone When you request for desktop site it doesn t work 
len ratingthree I loved Chrome because it deviates away from the Safari format but this new update tries to clone safari 
len ratingthree Everything from the nav buttons to the tab layouts 
len ratingone This new design is trash makes it look just like safari 
len ratingone Bring back the old layout or at least give us the option to have the old layout 
len ratingone This new one is garbage 
len ratingtwo Please fix the spam pop ups in Chrome 
len ratingtwo They are annoying 
len ratingone I downloaded the new version on an IPhone Plus 
len ratingone Now it does not open 
len ratingone I do not know if there is anything else I have to do but if there is I have not found the instructions 
len ratingone I hate it and everything about it 
len ratingfour I typically love Chrome 
len ratingfour Even recently when I decided to give an apple product a try I opted for chrome over safari 
len ratingfour I like the new look update but it is a little buggy 
len ratingfour I m not sure if it s just the iOS version that is having the issue 
len ratingfour For instance when I go to the espn website to check out the nfl stat lines 
len ratingfour The ability to choose what stats I want to look at is gone but they still appear in the safari version 
len ratingfour Even when I request the desktop version of the site they are still missing 
len ratingfour I m sure it ll get worked out soon 
len ratingone I liked chrome because it wasn t safari so what do they do 
len ratingone Turn it into safari GG google
len ratingfive I ve been using google chrome for a while on my pc and iPhone 
len ratingfive Never had a problem 
len ratingfive The last update changed things so dramatically for a better experience 
len ratingfive Everything is more accessible and I do mean everything 
len ratingfive I love the new layout 
len ratingthree  The new version is MUCH IMPROVED 
len ratingthree It still draws some sites wonky on my iPhone XS but it s getting much better 
len ratingthree It s easier to close tabs by sliding up or down please bring that back 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingfive This is WAY better then Safari but how is it different from the normal Google app 
len ratingone Wanna view more than four and a half tabs at a time without scrolling excessively up and down 
len ratingone Too bad 
len ratingone Wanna be able to read the website URLs on all your tabs when you re researching referencing across multiple sites 
len ratingone Too bad 
len ratingone Wanna see the supposed upgrade preview of the site on each tab 
len ratingone Nope 
len ratingone Just gonna give you a four and a half empty boxes with rounded corners and enough URL at the top of each to know it starts with 
len ratingone Thanks Captain Obvious 
len ratingone I know each one is a website on the World Wide Web 
len ratingone I need to know WHAT site without clicking on EACH EMPTY TAB FOR FIVE F ING MINUTES and wait for it to load again to see what it is until I stumble across the right one rinse and repeat for hours 
len ratingone I cannot imagine a worse way to try to streamline a search engine on a mobile device which is sad because it was GOOD before the update 
len ratingone Simple 
len ratingone Usable 
len ratingone In the best way possible 
len ratingone There doesn t appear to be a way to customize it either 
len ratingone Again it s so much worse than its predecessor I wonder what the hell happened over there when they were designing it 
len ratingone I ve been wrestling with it ever since I updated my OS weeks now and today I just finally snapped 
len ratingone Epic fail Chrome 
len ratingone This update makes Safari look good 
len ratingone I guess I m going to have to go back 
len ratingone At least it actually still has real honest to God tabs with viewable URL previews 
len ratingfour I use this app fairly regularly and my experience has been above satisfactory 
len ratingfour My only issue is not being able to activate cookies 
len ratingfour More to the point when I attempt to use my two step Duo Security login I get a message telling me to enable cookies in order for my device to be remembered 
len ratingfour However for the life of me I cannot find how to do this 
len ratingfour Clear cookies yes 
len ratingfour Enable no 
len ratingfour I can btw do this on my laptop 
len ratingfour But not on my iPad 
len ratingone There app is bad and the people who made this has terrible adds there adds keep messing around with people cause every app I have when it shows there ad it won t go away so do not get the developers are terrible 
len ratingone I thought I got the chrome app not google 
len ratingone I thought google already has an app 
len ratingone I don t like background where it says google I like it when it is the chrome background 
len ratingtwo App won t open whyv
len ratingone Step 
len ratingone Install safari content clocker Step Delete chrome Done 
len ratingone Don t like it
len ratingone  I don t care for the new update 
len ratingone Bad connections Very slow 
len ratingone I think it s opening Safari rather than Chrome is that possible 
len ratingone Your New Update will not let me go into chrome and tells me to download it even when I already have 
len ratingone Hope you can please help 
len ratingone Can t type in search bar anymore 
len ratingthree  Why does it say that I need to be in order to download this 
len ratingone I ve used chrome because it s convenient 
len ratingone It s never been great 
len ratingone The new design has taken away my favorite feature 
len ratingone The recent site starting page now has sites instead of and I have to put my glasses on to see them due to the stupid round design 
len ratingone Both safari and chrome are pretty lame now 
len ratingfour Opening PDFs in chrome is a nightmare because I can t download it 
len ratingfour I have to open safari to save them to my Google Drive 
len ratingfour Other than that I like using this over safari 
len ratingthree Ok now Chrome is like Safari which is horrible I hate Safari 
len ratingthree Now Chrome on the iPhone is no longer a tabbed browser and requires more clicks to switch windows 
len ratingthree Recent Chrome updates on the iPad and Windows have tabs so now Chrome is also inconsistent across platforms 
len ratingthree Please allow us to revert back or have tabs via a setting 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree The new ui for the browser is really dumb looking 
len ratingthree It was fine before why does Google always make pointless ui changes that don t need to happen 
len ratingone I can t stand the new update 
len ratingone Switched to Firefox and I love it 
len ratingone It s more like the old Chrome and definitely faster 
len ratingone Give it a try 
len ratingone This update is so ugly that everyone died 
len ratingthree Hate the new layout 
len ratingthree Makes it difficult or impossible to block embedded pop ups 
len ratingthree Even though I have block pop ups enabled 
len ratingone The new update makes it look exactly like Safari 
len ratingone Safari is awful which is why I use Chrome 
len ratingtwo I keep tapping on the address bar and attempting to regress the page and it s completely frozen 
len ratingone This update was Unnecessary 
len ratingone The old chrome was better and I hate the bugs on this version
len ratingtwo Not a fan of the new look 
len ratingone Everything is harder and worse in the new UI 
len ratingone Google why are you so terrible at Product 
len ratingone The new version is less user friendly and removed many of the features I liked about Google Chrome 
len ratingone It now looks and acts like Safari 
len ratingone The search function is slow and having the navigation buttons on the bottom is less intuitive 
len ratingone Also I hate the way that multiple tabs are shown 
len ratingone It was better to have them stacked and able to swipe through 
len ratingone Going through the preview pane with all of them next to each other makes the process slower 
len ratingone At this point I might as well go back to Safari 
len ratingone Google you made a poor judgement when you decided to redo the entire Chrome layout and functionality 
len ratingone It was heads better because it was faster and more user friendly 
len ratingthree Lately when using chrome for iOS I get pop ups saying I ve won something 
len ratingthree I am unable to close out of them and I have to restart my iPad 
len ratingthree When I use Safari I never get these pop ups 
len ratingthree Please fix this issue so I can continue using chrome 
len ratingone The iPhone App Store indicated that Chrome needed an update so I clicked update and the update indicator has been circling ineffectively for over a week while all other updates succeeded 
len ratingone Don t know if it s a Chrome or Apple defect 
len ratingone I am unable to stop the endless fruitless circling
len ratingone I have had chrome for years and was my preferred internet app but as of I am no longer a fan 
len ratingone Why is it that I can o my use my chrome around WiFi only 
len ratingone It won t let me use it with my regular data 
len ratingtwo I hate the new interface please give an option of switching back to old one 
len ratingtwo It s to much like safari I might as well use it if this is what I wanted
len ratingthree The new look is not as clean as the old one also harder to add bookmark now 
len ratingfive good job google 
len ratingtwo I usually love Chrome but the new update makes me feel like I m on safari again 
len ratingtwo The buttons are in the wrong place 
len ratingtwo I took me FOREVER to find the back button 
len ratingtwo If updating wasn t forced on my phone I would have never updated this 
len ratingtwo I want my old version back 
len ratingtwo The last few versions of Chrome have been problematic with both usability and reliability suffering compared to prior versions 
len ratingtwo More websites lead to unresponsive open menus more sites cause a crash of the whole app if left open for a while requiring a reboot 
len ratingtwo This is all with the latest iOS on an iPad Pro 
len ratingtwo If there was a way to easily take everything I ve saved in Chrome to another app I d be happy to try it 
len ratingtwo But there isn t because it s not in their interest to do so which isn t to say that the import of data into other apps is any better 
len ratingtwo It s all kind of a mess 
len ratingtwo I long for the days of era Chrome but I m invested enough in the ecosystem to make it unlikely that I ll switch to something else 
len ratingtwo So I hope the stability and usability improves like why does it take such a long press to open a link in a new tab now 
len ratingtwo but I m not holding my breath 
len ratingone Completely reconfigured and when u get spam pop ups u have no option to close them 
len ratingone Go back to what works google
len ratingone  This version so ugly and slow for iphone pls change i don t want this version any more its make my iphone xs too soo
len ratingone Wish I never updated by trying to make it look nicer which it doesn t look better at all they took away good features 
len ratingone Back to safari or something else 
len ratingtwo I hate it when developers change user interface features for what they think is cool and useful to them forcing loyal users to have to change an old habit built up from years of using an already good product 
len ratingtwo For Google please bring back the flick to close a tab feature that s in Safari and in all your previous versions of Chrome 
len ratingfive I feel like comfortable using this
len ratingtwo Like many others have said I prefer the classic chrome browser 
len ratingtwo I ve stayed away from safari because I don t like it 
len ratingtwo Now this is mimicking it pretty closely 
len ratingtwo Not only that I felt the classic version was better to navigate and easier to close the open tabs 
len ratingtwo If some like this format fine 
len ratingtwo But it would be nice if they let those of us who don t to go back to the prior format 
len ratingtwo Or uninstall this update 
len ratingtwo Update liking it less 
len ratingtwo Quite honestly it has been performing a lot slower than the old versions 
len ratingtwo Have already had several loading issues too and freezing 
len ratingtwo Also the tabs are so much harder to close 
len ratingtwo The darn x on the right corner doesn t always work 
len ratingone Why you changed the look and feel which had in Chrome 
len ratingone We don t want another google browser 
len ratingone This is an extreme disappointment and ruined the user friendliness uniqued the Chrome 
len ratingone Pls don t do changes just because you need to something different each time 
len ratingone This last update completely changed the layout and it functions looks just like Safari 
len ratingone I ve used Google Chrome for years because I hated the Safari layout and now they re pretty much the same 
len ratingone This new Chrome is so hard for me to navigate through 
len ratingone You guys made things more complicated when the other layout was perfect and easy to use 
len ratingone Looks like I m not the only one feeling this way 
len ratingone I agree with one person s suggestion of having an option to go back to the classic mode of Chrome 
len ratingone Why change something that no one had problems with 
len ratingone I guess I m going to have to find a new browser with a better layout unless you guys change it back 
len ratingone Listen to your reviews 
len ratingone With the new update this is literally just safari 
len ratingone I m uninstalling because I m not going to waste space on a second instance of safari and I m looking for a new browser to be loyal to 
len ratingone The only thing worse than chrome itself are the constant nags to install chrome when navigating to a google website after uninstalling it 
len ratingtwo Where is the share icon when you copy a URL 
len ratingtwo Why was it removed 
len ratingone Much to my surprise the entire layout changed on my phone and it is horrible 
len ratingone Not sure why everyone is going to this childish Fisher Price looking platform 
len ratingone Ridiculous and non functional 
len ratingtwo The app works fine and all but the redesign of the app doesn t seem to flow very well to me 
len ratingtwo I d love to get he old layout back if I could 
len ratingtwo I regret updating 
len ratingone I m having serious issue of uploading any document through iPad 
len ratingone Whenever I browse to drive and select the document to upload the tabs becomes smaller and then browser freezes 
len ratingone Ultimately I have to restart it again but uploading doesn t work 
len ratingone Kindly fix it soon 
len ratingone Why does it open uber app when I try to open Crome
len ratingone Opens to the last site even when it s maliciously trapped in a loop of endless dialog and popup boxes 
len ratingone Even if I kill the app it just reopens to the same endless loop of popups when re launched 
len ratingone And there s no way to change the settings from outside the app 
len ratingone Nice job Google 
len ratingone Delete 
len ratingone I hate it i liked the open new search in r upper corner and being able to close open pages also in that r upper corner 
len ratingone This new format looks cheap and very outdated 
len ratingone Sometimes if things arent broke they dont need fixed 
len ratingone Considering uninstalling and downloading another search engine 
len ratingone Chrome has been my only browser for ages 
len ratingone This is because I ve always detested Safaris layout 
len ratingone Well guess who just literally turned their layout upside down 
len ratingone This is the equivalent of a punk band building a fan base over a decade drumming excitement for a new album then releasing a pop country record uggggh time to find a new browser 
len ratingone So now chrome looks and feels like safari but drags your battery down like well chrome 
len ratingone Hope they realize this is not good and fix it 
len ratingone I m going with safari as my iPhone can t deal with the drain 
len ratingone I ve used Google and Chrome for years but recently searching on abcnews up pops all the headline stories for the day not just abc but most major news outlets and everyone of them had a negative article about Trump 
len ratingone I ve stopped use chrome or google search as I m not letting a bunch of people from Mountainview tell me what I should be thinking about our country s leaders 
len ratingtwo Bug needs fixing
len ratingone Used to love this browser used it on all my devices for years 
len ratingone Now I m seconding everyone else s sentiments that it s now making my want to switch to another browser the new look layout is garbage since the most recent update 
len ratingone Please give me an option to switch back to Classic mode 
len ratingone I don t want the toolbar on the bottom and I don t want it auto hiding on me 
len ratingone If I wanted a browser that looked and functioned just like Safari I would just use Safari 
len ratingone I try Chrome every so often to see if it works yet 
len ratingone Nope still a piece of crap 
len ratingtwo having a lot of trouble opening new tabs it keeps opening existing tabs 
len ratingtwo always takes tries can t imagine how many tries it takes people with bigger fingers
len ratingtwo  To get back to old chrome go to chrome flags top chrome md in your browser and disable ui refresh phase 
len ratingtwo  redesign 
len ratingone The new updates oh my the bar on the bottom seems practical yes in some type of efficiency rating or something but I ve been doing it essentially the same way for nearly a decade far prior to chrome and with Chrome exclusively on all my devices since it s launch 
len ratingone This feels so unnatural and awkward even though it s supposed to be easier 
len ratingone I guess maybe it s for people with screens too large to reach the corners 
len ratingone It makes sense more time on entertainment bigger displays more need to reach there wthe further away it gets 
len ratingone Then the page where we see all our open tabs 
len ratingone What were you thinking 
len ratingone Now I can t just smoothly swipe them all away when I see I have windows open while shopping or researching now I have to hit each little X 
len ratingone That part is not only LESS ergonomic it takes longer 
len ratingone It s way more annoying to aim when I could lazily swipe em off much more quickly 
len ratingone I also didn t need more visibility of the pages I could already see what they were 
len ratingone I also didn t desire the ability the get to bookmarks faster or save credit cards to chrome 
len ratingone Who uses those 
len ratingone It s still instinct and easy to type the first couple letters in the the bar and click the link they want and I don t need my card info saved on any more things than it already is 
len ratingone I would worried about the security of my devices even though I m sure it s fairly secure 
len ratingone Someone please tell me there s a way to change any of this in settings 
len ratingone I m gonna check out what other browsers I might be interested in too since I haven t in some time 
len ratingone But please at least give us a Classic styling setting or something 
len ratingone Just a setting for the bar at the least and I ll go back to stars and fix my review 
len ratingfive I ve never wanted to write a review for an app before but wow is this recent update amazing 
len ratingfive Awesome job guys really 
len ratingfive The app flows so smoothly and everything is so easily accessible 
len ratingtwo  Like many others have said I prefer the classic chrome browser 
len ratingtwo I ve stayed away from safari because I don t like it 
len ratingtwo Now this is mimicking it pretty closely 
len ratingtwo Not only that I felt the classic version was better to navigate and easier to close the open tabs 
len ratingtwo If some like this format fine 
len ratingtwo But it would be nice if they let those of us who don t to go back to the prior format 
len ratingtwo Or uninstall this update 
len ratingtwo Please have the iPad version of the Chrome app resemble the desktop version 
len ratingtwo The redesign made the overall size of the desktop top bar smaller but the iPad still has it taking up a huge section of the top of the screen 
len ratingone I have an iPhone but I hated Safari because of their browser so I made google chrome the default browser on my iPhone 
len ratingone The reason being I liked the browser being similar to a regular desktop browser where the tabs pages and back forward buttons are up at the top 
len ratingone I HATE them being at the bottom and have now been having trouble with getting the bar to appear so I can switch between my tabs or click the back button 
len ratingone The app was stars but the change to the browser dropped them to a star for me 
len ratingfour New review More buttons at bottom finally makes this app much better 
len ratingfour I ve successfully switched to it 
len ratingfour Slightly better than safari 
len ratingfour Add duplicate tab to menu at bottom 
len ratingfour This would rock 
len ratingfour Safari mobile doesn t have this 
len ratingfour When not at top of page should be able to get the bottom buttons to appear by a small hot spot area at the bottom like safari 
len ratingfour You can work around this by scrolling up but that isn t as natural 
len ratingfour Please remove the visual effect delay when you press the pages button button with number in it 
len ratingfour Safari does this feature MUCH quicker 
len ratingfour Old review Chrome needs to have similar buttons to safari which are at the button 
len ratingfour That s the only way I would use this 
len ratingfour I do use chrome on windows every day 
len ratingfour With those buttons at the bottom I would definitely prefer chrome 
len ratingfour Safari won t let you create folders when adding a bookmark 
len ratingfour Too bad iOS doesn t have a back button and a menu button like android 
len ratingfive  I hate the desktop update of Google Chrome but I love the mobile update 
len ratingfive And by changing the way the multi tab view works they removed a glitch I ran into far too often where when you clicked the button it closed your current tab 
len ratingfive That glitch made me mad 
len ratingtwo There s a reason people don t use safari 
len ratingtwo Please fix the tabs options 
len ratingtwo I m a heavy tabs user and scrolling through all the stupid tiles is infuriating 
len ratingtwo It seems as though this update is getting terrible reviews 
len ratingtwo Google please listen to us 
len ratingtwo Navigation bar at the bottom doesn t hide and it occupies unnecessary space
len ratingone I can t stand the new update the whole reason I got google chrome was so I wouldn t have to use god awful safari thanks google for making chrome just like safari 
len ratingone Cheers 
len ratingfive Best app and it is my best friend 
len ratingone I love chrome but the new look is awful 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I would
len ratingone I closed out chrome a few times thinking it was safari 
len ratingone I HATE the new layout with a passion 
len ratingone Since when did Chrome become Safari 
len ratingone I use chrome to avoid the struggle of going Safari and you ve gone and made chrome on mobile into literally a Safari clone 
len ratingone It s the same layout and it feels extremely copycat 
len ratingone Overall pretty bummed that you guys dropped to this level 
len ratingone Chrome has always stood out from other browsers until now 
len ratingone It looks like safari 
len ratingone I cannot stand safari 
len ratingtwo New UI is trash 
len ratingone Here is the feedback you requested Chrome has always been my go to browser until this week 
len ratingone When I force close and reopen it usually tells me that it crashed today I am googling Mark Everett am getting a black screen 
len ratingone Google why do you hate Mark Everett 
len ratingone I use chrome on windows and android 
len ratingone On IOS it is terrible 
len ratingfour  New review More buttons at bottom finally makes this app much better 
len ratingfour I ll try switching now 
len ratingfour Please remove the visual effect delay when you press the pages button button with number in it 
len ratingfour Safari does this feature MUCH quicker 
len ratingfour After I use this for a while I may change my rating up more likely or down 
len ratingfour Old review Chrome needs to have similar buttons to safari which are at the button 
len ratingfour That s the only way I would use this 
len ratingfour I do use chrome on windows every day 
len ratingfour With those buttons at the bottom I would definitely prefer chrome 
len ratingfour Safari won t let you create folders when adding a bookmark 
len ratingfour Too bad iOS doesn t have a back button and a menu button like android 
len ratingone How do I get my old google chrome back 
len ratingone This new browser is awful 
len ratingfive This new update is amazing 
len ratingfive Love it that you can switch tabs without having to reach the top of the screen and cuter UI too 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingone Without allowing ad blockers the number of googles acceptable ads is so vast that you ll be downloading and scrolling through so much content to just read small blurb of what you are looking for 
len ratingone Had to uninstall 
len ratingone Unusable on a mobile device 
len ratingfive Like the new update 
len ratingfive It s much easier and faster to exit all the windows manually when you don t want specific ones to close 
len ratingfive The old version was tedious and sometimes wouldn t register what I was doing 
len ratingthree I love chrome mostly because it saves my passwords and bookmarks in the same place 
len ratingthree I use chrome on my PC and its also nice to see my open tabs on my iPad or phone when I walk into another room and forget what the screen said 
len ratingthree Writing this reveiew because I just found a pretty horrendous bug in this app involving the Gmail web client on the iPad running iOS 
len ratingthree Was trying to send an email within the compose popup within the Chrome Browser 
len ratingthree I typed my whole email then selected to add an attachment 
len ratingthree I didn t see my file so I selected to cancel the file upload 
len ratingthree This brought me to a blank Chrome logo and the Chrome app was unresponsive 
len ratingthree I was forced to reset the app causing me to lose my work 
len ratingthree Hope they fix this quick because its a repro rate of 
len ratingfour Don t like the nested features as much bookmarks etc 
len ratingfour but still a pretty fine browser 
len ratingone Just have to say I m pretty disappointed in the developers of Google Chrome 
len ratingone Not only have I left multiple reviews on how terrible this update is but many others have as well 
len ratingone If the developers don t adhere to their users complaints and revert it back soon they will most likely lose a good chunk of those users 
len ratingone If the developers of Chrome want to remain a favorite of many users they will have to make some major changes soon 
len ratingone Very bad update you just copy the safari browser with just change the name 
len ratingone How can i back to the pervious version 
len ratingthree Couple things chrome can t do that safari does Can t open a web powerpoint in keynote or other ppt software No reading view and more
len ratingfour In the recent versions is terrible that the page refresh with every scroll on the page 
len ratingfour When you down the fingers for go to the top of the page is frustrating the page refresh 
len ratingfour This is not a good idea 
len ratingfour The refresh of the page is better with a simple button maybe 
len ratingfour Multiple web platforms depends of the scroll
len ratingfour  Is there a way to change it back to the old interface 
len ratingfour I hate how it looks exactly like safari 
len ratingfour Please change it back After searching going to chrome flags and then disabling the UI options 
len ratingfour The old interface came back 
len ratingfour Please don t force the new layout on everyone
len ratingone i
len ratingtwo Doesn t wanna load pages correctly 
len ratingtwo I havw to use google or safari 
len ratingone tor is better
len ratingone  I don t know it s chrome or safari
len ratingfour I recently added my accounts to chrome was signed out of my main account but when I try to sign in again it tells me to re enter my password for my other account 
len ratingfour I have re entered my password and I have removed that account but I still have to re enter that same password for my account that s not my main one 
len ratingfour Help
len ratingtwo Hidden object game
len ratingthree I still have to use Safari because there isn t a link to create a desktop icon for iPhone app 
len ratingthree I frequently create shortcuts this way as I seldom use bookmarks 
len ratingthree Please add this functionality and then you ll get a star from me 
len ratingthree The new look is awful it looks like Safari now 
len ratingthree I have to stop and hunt for the buttons for everything and the cartoonish look makes it seem less professional 
len ratingthree It also seems like the interface takes up more screen room than it did before 
len ratingthree Its disappointing
len ratingfive New update is very good and user friend
len ratingone August more trash from google developers simply try saving a PDF to your phone with the most recent Chrome update doesn t work 
len ratingone when I say more trash I m referring to the fact that Crowne gets updated about every six months as opposed to paid Gsuite customers which sea and update about every two years 
len ratingone I regret every day that I put my biz clients on Gsuite over office 
len ratingone It s unbelievable that in Google Chrome there is no Google cloud print option just as there is on chrome on android chrome on desktop Mac and chrome on desktop PC 
len ratingone Additionally the lack of timely improvements updates development on iOS chrome is unacceptable however it seems in the past two or three years this is the case on just about all Google products 
len ratingone Google seems to have stopped innovating and improving updating it s various products and instead now focuses on being about as good as other products companies such as Apple and playing catch up when they release new functionality or features 
len ratingone Look at Gmail when was the last time it received any updates or new features 
len ratingone What about Gsuite biz enterprise 
len ratingone or Google Drive docs personal 
len ratingone Updates are few and far between and chrome on iOS is another example of this 
len ratingtwo I used Chrome because it was a minimalistic browser with everything I needed and nothing I didn t 
len ratingtwo Now with the new redesign instead of all buttons and access being at the top of the page now it s split between the top and bottom 
len ratingtwo It s cumbersome and no longer appeals to me 
len ratingtwo I consider Google products to be great but this latest update has me searching else where for a browser on my iPhone 
len ratingfour its a good browser but has less customizability than the desktop chrome 
len ratingfour some people will like this new update that changes the layout but i personally hope that the next update gives the option to go back the the other layout with the icons on top
len ratingthree  This update looks cartoonish and reminds me way too much of Safari 
len ratingthree There s a reason I don t use Safari 
len ratingthree Please stop moving features around I m tired of looking for bookmarks or open tabs in a new location 
len ratingone I spent a good seconds trying to figure out why my phone was suddenly opening links in Safari and why I couldn t get out of it 
len ratingone Then to my horror I realized I was in Chrome 
len ratingone That toolbar at the bottom 
len ratingone Heartbreaking 
len ratingone I know a lot of tried and true apps eventually release that one update that alienates their most enthusiastic users 
len ratingone Time to move on now I suppose 
len ratingone I already have safari so why do I need google chrome 
len ratingone I use to like google chrome because they were different 
len ratingone But now they re the same so what s the point 
len ratingone If I wanted a Safari like browser I d use Safari 
len ratingfive I love the new update on google chrome s home page and navigation tab 
len ratingfive It s so convenient and easy to use 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone This new UI feels clumsy and confusing 
len ratingthree My app just updated to the new look which is actually Safari s old look What kind of browser app thinks SAFARI is the app to model after 
len ratingthree This used to be the best browser app for your phone 
len ratingthree Not anymore 
len ratingfive This is by far the best version please don t ruin it 
len ratingone Version is terrible 
len ratingone Avoid updating if you haven t done so 
len ratingtwo Yeah whoever decided that getting rid of the address bar and then having the search pop up to become the address bar is unqalified to design user interfaces 
len ratingtwo People that are using a touch interface don t want their input boxes hopping around the screen 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingone  This latest update makes Chrome look like Safari 
len ratingone I have specifically used Chrome because I did not like Safari 
len ratingone If it doesn t get changed back to the old format I ll find something else and delete Chrome 
len ratingone The new version is super laggy and super slow and does not load pages all the way 
len ratingone Running on IPhone Plus 
len ratingthree I thought the update was weird until I got a new phone now I appreciate the buttons on the bottom 
len ratingthree This app is good when it works however frustrating when it doesn t 
len ratingthree I currently can t sign in on any iOS device due to chrome sign in error 
len ratingthree I haven t found any fix yet and will probably stop using this app for a while and see if it magically starts working again 
len ratingtwo whenever i open a new tab it completely jumps all the other tabs so if you want to go back and forth between pages its a hastle 
len ratingtwo the old version opened up a tab right next to the current one
len ratingtwo Thanks for the new update 
len ratingtwo Might as well use safari 
len ratingtwo It s the exact same layout and just as frustrating to use 
len ratingtwo Thanks Google 
len ratingone Horrible downgrade google 
len ratingone Having a fixed bar at the bottom of the view window is such a horrible experience 
len ratingone I hate that safari has it it s why I use google chrome 
len ratingone This update is bad get rid of the bottom bar 
len ratingone Viewport space is limited enough as it is adding an additional px or so to the bottom of the screen for features that could be added to a button in the top navigation is straight theft of viewable space 
len ratingone Very disappointed that Google deemed it necessary to log me in automatically when using Chrome 
len ratingone I m a savvy user and I didn t notice the change or any noticed that it was going to happen 
len ratingone I expect better from Google 
len ratingone Love the browser hate the opt in 
len ratingone Will start using Safari and Firefox 
len ratingone SMH
len ratingone  Why did this update need to happen 
len ratingone Did you get a series of requests to be more like Safari 
len ratingone Why wouldn t those people just go and use Safari then 
len ratingone The new look is awful and you should seriously reconsider 
len ratingone  The title kinda says it all 
len ratingone If I wanted to use a garbage browser like safari I would not have wasted my time downloading chrome 
len ratingone Who asked for this update 
len ratingone Was there a real problem or are you trying to fix something not broken for the sake of innovation 
len ratingone Don t try and be something you are not 
len ratingone Go your own way 
len ratingone But I hate this update 
len ratingone They have updated it with everything I hated about Chrome 
len ratingone I particularly hate navigating from the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone I don t really care about changes in the way the app looks but it s not functioning 
len ratingone Pages keep crashing 
len ratingone No reason not to use Safari instead 
len ratingone Feels like I m using safari
len ratingfive This new design has great look and feel easy to manage sessions tabs and history 
len ratingfive Loving it
len ratingtwo The new layout looks childish as if something out of 
len ratingtwo I enjoyed the convenience of having everything at the top of my screen 
len ratingtwo At least make an option to have the old layout back because this new one takes away all of the charm and sleekness of the old one 
len ratingtwo Chrome needs to update for the XS Max screen size
len ratingone Not a good app if you can t open it 
len ratingfour Usually this app is great but I ve been trying to access it and it won t even up before it crashes 
len ratingfour Please fix this 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone I used chrome because I did not like safari 
len ratingone This new update makes chrome look like safari which defeats the purpose of getting chrome 
len ratingone Please go back to the old design 
len ratingone Otherwise I will just use Safari
len ratingone How can I get back to your previous version 
len ratingone This update was Google s worst update 
len ratingone I can not stand Google at all Please go back to the previous version of how I can go
len ratingone I ve always been a huge fan of google Chrome 
len ratingone Haven t used a different browser in years 
len ratingone But this last update is the WORST 
len ratingone It crashes and freezes almost every time I use it especially when you try and upload something to a website 
len ratingone It s gotten to be so frustrating and unbearable I won t even use it now not on my iPhone anyway 
len ratingone Safari puts Chrome to shame now 
len ratingone Disappointing Google
len ratingtwo One thing the recent update does is move all the settings and things down to where many websites have their pop ups 
len ratingtwo This makes it often impossible to press the back button or to access bookmarks when I ve landed on one of these sites 
len ratingtwo The choices now are to click the ad no thanks or close Chrome 
len ratingtwo Please put the settings section back to the top 
len ratingtwo Its ok i liked it at first but its to slow and i really dont like that i have to keep re entering things cuz the page wont register the input also when im trying to navagate away from a page trapping me on that page so that it must load before i can do anything else is unacceptable if the page is malicious and i have other tabs open in order to avoid that page i must loose all my tabs also if i am on a metered connection which I frequently am you are needlessly running up my meter 
len ratingtwo I never thought id be deleting google but i replaced you on my desktop weeks ago with no regrets getting ready to say goodbye to your SLOW dis functional clutter on my phone as well please make me something EFFICIENT 
len ratingtwo Less clicks per task 
len ratingtwo More information in display at my control 
len ratingtwo It was your decision to make the drive applications completely inept that resulted in my prompt deletion of them 
len ratingtwo now i cant google anything it doesn t work It s not working as safari
len ratingfive I use many useful google services 
len ratingfive All of them are better than some of those by Apple or Microsoft two other companies which products I use because they re free to use and easily accessible 
len ratingtwo Based on my experience using this app for a few days on iphone this is worse in every way than Safari except for blocking redirects 
len ratingtwo It s slower to load and load pages doesn t keep snapshots of open tabs and the search function doesn t seem to work sometimes 
len ratingtwo But it blocks redirects so I ll keep using it for now 
len ratingtwo I don t write reviews ever but I m getting tired of having to foreclose the app because I try to upload something and it just goes to the tabs page and doesn t let me push done 
len ratingtwo Please fix this bug it s annoying and makes me have to use Safari 
len ratingthree I used to love the old layout because it didn t remind me of Safari 
len ratingthree Now with the new layout all the button have been placed on the bottom of the screen and I haven t even been able to open the browser because it shuts off on me every time I try 
len ratingthree I have given it a three star rating because of how great it used to be and maybe they will fix the bugs but as of right now it is really buggy and unfortunately reminds me too much of Safari 
len ratingone I use chrome because I hated safari 
len ratingone What s the point that they re the same now 
len ratingone Put the stupid bar at the bottom on top right corner 
len ratingone Preferred previous version 
len ratingone New update turned a great browser into just an okay browser 
len ratingone Very disappointing 
len ratingone For whatever reason google has decided to roll out it s terrible Fisher Price esque redesign of its products to the phone as well 
len ratingone In this case they remove the cleanness and functionality of the browser and replace it with something godawful to use and terrible to look at 
len ratingone I know Google s slack jawed project managers have to meddle with perfect products to justify their jobs but this time they ve taken this particular app from a down to a 
len ratingtwo  I ve always been a chrome lover but the latest version felt more of a downgrade rather than an upgrade 
len ratingtwo It looks soooo similar to Safari and I don t get why they would do that 
len ratingtwo Trying to find a way to roll back to previous version because this is horrible
len ratingthree I m looking for a way to disable the most visited icons on the new tab page 
len ratingthree They have NEVER been correct 
len ratingthree Not once have they been useful 
len ratingthree Either fix the algorithm or add an option to completely disable those 
len ratingone The new location for tabs on the bottom is useless to me 
len ratingone It does not make it easier to reach just a pointless change after it s been at the top for years 
len ratingone The new tabs layout is bothersome 
len ratingone I liked the old one just fine nothing wrong with it 
len ratingone I don t like how my top browser bar has lost multiple layers of functionality 
len ratingone I want the back button back at the top left I want my tab options back at the top right 
len ratingone I want my bottom screen free and clear of added obstructions 
len ratingone The bottom bar plus a top bar only wastes screen real estate 
len ratingone Basically moving this has made my chrome experience bad compared to it being my preferred browser 
len ratingone I m very disappointed with it
len ratingthree The newest update to chrome is terrible 
len ratingthree It makes it more like safari and the settings are in a bad order 
len ratingone If I had wanted a layout like this I would have used Safari from the start
len ratingone They totally redesigned chrome the other week and it seems to be worse in nearly every way 
len ratingone The menu bar is now harder to open because you have to scroll up instead of tap or scroll down the tabs are now organized like square pictures instead of tabs 
len ratingone You need click on the little x instead of swiping 
len ratingone The new tab button takes an extra two taps to get to 
len ratingone The search bar is not as intuitive because it doesn t always display what you d expect 
len ratingone It s weird because I love Chrome but I m debating switching after this update
len ratingone BRING THE OLD VERSION BACK 
len ratingone The new and better google chrome well it s revolting 
len ratingone So hard to do pretty much everything 
len ratingone Before it was so quick to do whatever you needed to 
len ratingone And why are you copying safari the people using google chrome are using it obviously because they don t like safari 
len ratingone I like google chrome 
len ratingone But the new redesign is just ugly 
len ratingone I can t stand it 
len ratingone It looks like fire fox 
len ratingone I like the classic chrome look it s always had and won t be updating 
len ratingone Instructions on how to get out of incognito mode not clear and I am having difficulty getting out Hi Some recent design updates have changed how to open Incognito tabs on Chrome iOS 
len ratingone A To open a new tab Tap More 
len ratingone  To open an Incognito Tab select New Incognito Tab 
len ratingone  To open a regular Chrome Tab select New Tab 
len ratingone B To switch between Inco
len ratingone Hey Google I used Google over safari on purpose 
len ratingone Please revert back to classic FYI safari is horrible please do not emulate it 
len ratingone I was used to be the biggest fan advocate for Chrome on iOS 
len ratingone The type of person when using a friends phone and they only had Safari would tell them how deprived they were for using such a bad browser 
len ratingone However after the update I would never recommend Google Chrome to anyone 
len ratingone As someone else said it s Safari V 
len ratingone Why change something that wasn t broken 
len ratingone Every other app uses navigation buttons at the top of the screen and you ate trying to switch this on us and I m not OK with that 
len ratingone  I was using Chrome after update on my iPad when I needed to upload a document to the healthcare gov website 
len ratingone I clicked on the button to select a file and selected a file I stored on my iCloud Drive 
len ratingone As soon as I did the app goes into the tab view showing all Chrome tabs as very small icons 
len ratingone There was no way to select the image to maximize the tab I was working on 
len ratingone And even though it was much too small to see I tried working on the site in that view but was very unsuccessful 
len ratingone At the top right of that view was the word Done which I thought might take me back to the normal view 
len ratingone But touching Done did absolutely nothing 
len ratingone I do not know what else may be wrong with this new tab view but it certainly appears testing was lacking 
len ratingone You guys usually do very good work so I know you ll make efforts to correct this issue 
len ratingone Doing so quickly will be greatly appreciated 
len ratingone Not sure who s to blame here but Chrome suddenly will just stop working unless I reboot my phone 
len ratingone I didn t have this issue before upgrading to iOS 
len ratingone I ve run a test on an old iPhone s running iOS going to the same websites at the same time and it never fails to connect unlike my iPhone Plus running iOS 
len ratingfive  Hello reviewers I m so happy to use Chrome app 
len ratingfive Chrome have good speed engine and redesign the new age of Chrome ever 
len ratingfive I m so speechless but only thing I feel dissatisfy how Chrome is design based on what Google Team think of best to change the new look of Chrome 
len ratingfive I wanting to use Night Mode Dark Mode that I could read or surfing the internet while time is night 
len ratingfive I prefer to use Night Mode Dark Mode because it s good visual to see than bright light theme and its harm to my eyes eye pain 
len ratingfive I m eagerly to see if you guys Google Team would willing to discuss and whether should add or not 
len ratingfive I m not sure if you guys did read this review or not 
len ratingfive still it s not matter if I need to know if you are read or not 
len ratingfive As long as I know if you are aware of your customer s satisfaction and others 
len ratingfive I wish this app might have download for files and easy to share the people your friends family relatives etc 
len ratingfive And video floating too 
len ratingfive I am very familiar with video floating and multi window browser 
len ratingfive So hope you guys will award of your Chrome s reviewers or customers satisfaction 
len ratingfive Have a nice day 
len ratingfive  Reviewer
len ratingone The new version moves the back button and toolbar to the bottom while the address bar remains at the top 
len ratingone These things should be next to each other and the reach is too far now 
len ratingone Other things got worse too but this is by far the worst
len ratingone Would not let me update
len ratingone The newest design is a lot harder to navigate and was honestly unnecessary 
len ratingone The old design was a lot better 
len ratingone I don t think I ll be using this app anymore despite it being my favorite browser before the update 
len ratingone The browser was perfectly fine before 
len ratingone I do not want Safari 
len ratingone I HATE Safari 
len ratingone Thats why ai used Chrome 
len ratingone Why on Earth did the developers think imitating them was a good idea 
len ratingone Please go back to the old format
len ratingthree I am pretty bummed to see that there is now black behind the internet tabs 
len ratingthree This for me gives a dark depressing feel 
len ratingthree I am very dissapointed 
len ratingtwo The heck have you guys done to Chrome lately 
len ratingtwo What s all this era bubbly rounded garbage 
len ratingtwo You made it look more like Safari and I hate Safari 
len ratingtwo The functionality is weird and there are graphical issues as well 
len ratingtwo The desktop browser looks hosed now too 
len ratingtwo Change it back 
len ratingone please it s too white now it hurts my eyes
len ratingtwo  I do not like the new design 
len ratingtwo Specifically the way I hold my phone it s easier for me to access search and the menu for the bookmarks at the top of the screen not the bottom 
len ratingtwo I would like the option to have the toolbar at the top instead of the bottom 
len ratingone El navegador presenta problemas al adjuntar archivos desde el OneDrive al querer realizar dicha acci n se selecciona el archivo y el navegador minimiza la pesta a y deja de responder solo permite cerrar las pesta as 
len ratingone Opened it up and thought I accidentally opened safari 
len ratingone I do not like the new design 
len ratingone Please go back to toolbar on top 
len ratingone I ll try it a few days but looks like I ll be switching back to Firefox 
len ratingfive  Please activate the video resolution gear when browsing YouTube from iphones 
len ratingone I find it a lot harder to go through my many many tabs in this new format esp since they now only show a word or two of the website titles 
len ratingone Not only that it also takes way longer to scroll through all my tabs to find the right one because the grid pieces take up so much more space than the old rows 
len ratingone I would really appreciate it if there could be a feature to select which view is preferred when viewing tabs the new grid view or the original row view
len ratingthree I really miss the old version mostly because I like to read in landscape mode and I used to be able to check the time battery percentage and WiFi cell reception 
len ratingthree Now all I get is the website domain 
len ratingthree I already know what website I m on 
len ratingthree I don t need it to be there in the top bar screaming at me 
len ratingthree This information is redundant and a waste of my limited screen space 
len ratingthree I just want to know what time it is 
len ratingthree And how much battery I have left before my phone dies 
len ratingthree Is that too much to ask 
len ratingtwo  Another useless company that used to be good
len ratingtwo  Chrome used to be my preferred browser but now with Chrome it has become quite the nuisance to use 
len ratingtwo The fact the toolbar is forced to the bottom without an option of reverting it to normal is disappointing at best and HEAVILY infuriating at most 
len ratingtwo If the layout we all know and love isn t making a come back please make a setting at the very least 
len ratingtwo  Every time I upload a file it crashes 
len ratingtwo Very inconvenient
len ratingone I m not using Chrome because I want a similar experience to Safari I m using it because the back buttons are in the same position as the majority of my other apps are to name the least of my grievances with the latest version 
len ratingone Please stop or give us an option to revert 
len ratingtwo Really 
len ratingtwo The best look for Chrome is to now look like Safari 
len ratingtwo If I wanted the look of the new Chrome I would have just used Safari to begin with 
len ratingtwo No thanks 
len ratingtwo Looks like I will be moving over to Duck Duck Go 
len ratingtwo At least DDG offers a dark theme 
len ratingthree  I love google products but did you have to go and copy safari controls placement 
len ratingthree the new version looks like safari 
len ratingthree is it possible to use the old version or roll back the update 
len ratingthree the grid for the tabs makes getting rid of old tabs all at once difficult and also gets rid of your previous ability to preview the tab before you open it 
len ratingthree also the bar on top showing the URL the person is using is both distracting and useless 
len ratingthree moving all functions to a previously nonexistent bottom bar is jarring for users and makes it look less like a browser and more like an app 
len ratingone  With the latest update downloads and uploads now fail when the screen times out 
len ratingone This did not happen before the update 
len ratingone iOS Chrome developers where s the regression testing 
len ratingone Also the new UI is awful 
len ratingone Why is there a redundant search field 
len ratingone Is the omnibox no longer omni 
len ratingone Trying to bring back the cool search box from Firefox 
len ratingone Safari has an omnibox with a redundant search box 
len ratingone The tab view is harder to use 
len ratingone I really liked being able to swipe close tabs 
len ratingone Now I have to hit tiny X targets 
len ratingone Safari lets me swipe 
len ratingtwo The changes were unnecessary and made it just like safari 
len ratingtwo I liked Google Chrome because it had a different layout I preferred 
len ratingtwo Changes really sucked 
len ratingone Big problem in the way Google implements Chrome s new tab management 
len ratingone I think tabs are the most important aspect of Chrome and now they require additional unnecessary steps to manipulate 
len ratingone This is the biggest drawback in September s update 
len ratingone Please bring back swipe gestures in tab management 
len ratingone This phone takes forever to download pour down load features
len ratingone It makes you want to install an app for every site you visit as those popup navbars from below and above are unbearable 
len ratingone Switching to safari for sure 
len ratingone With the iOS update it s too easy to close tabs when you actually mean to refresh them 
len ratingone Very aggravating
len ratingone My Apple ID is not my gmail username 
len ratingone When I enter my google password at the prompt which gives my gmail address I receive an error message saying username or password are incorrect 
len ratingone Same occurs if I enter my Apple ID password which is different from my google password 
len ratingone I can t understand why Google would completely change their UI on Chrome 
len ratingone If I wanted a tool bar on the bottom and a UI that isn t intuitive I d use Safari 
len ratingone Bring back the old Chrome 
len ratingone Or at least make it selectable 
len ratingthree I never liked the bottom toolbar when using safari and now google wants to imitate Apple 
len ratingthree Stop 
len ratingthree Chrome was awesome already 
len ratingthree I was very disappoint to see google cloud print removed from chrome 
len ratingthree I used that feature at work to print out documents to a non AirPrint printer 
len ratingthree Now I can t use my iPad anymore 
len ratingthree I like the redesign 
len ratingthree Just bring back google cloud print please 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome but now it crashes every few minutes and goes to a black screen 
len ratingone It s so annoying 
len ratingone I ve even had to start using Safari 
len ratingthree Have to constantly exit to check out time 
len ratingthree This is very inconvenient to a point of annoying 
len ratingone Never thought I d see Google make a mistake this big 
len ratingone This is almost Snapchat level trash 
len ratingone New UI is terrible 
len ratingone Wish they would have never changed it
len ratingtwo  Controls are in a terrible place now bottom left 
len ratingtwo It almost impossible to go back a webpage with one hand 
len ratingtwo FOUND A UI FIX 
len ratingtwo Just paste chrome flags top chrome md in the address bar then scroll down until you see UI refresh and set it to disabled 
len ratingtwo Relaunch Chrome and your back on the old UI 
len ratingtwo Woohoo 
len ratingtwo Thanks to user chaos on Reddit 
len ratingone I don t like the newest version 
len ratingone It looks exactly like Safari 
len ratingone I am unable to view all my bookmarks only mobile ones 
len ratingone I don t like how the search bar and forward backward buttons are on the bottom 
len ratingone I would be happy if I can go back to the previous version but don t know how unfortunately 
len ratingone  The latest update took a very stable and solid browser and turned it into something completely different 
len ratingone Very disappointed but had to delete it 
len ratingone Old version was much easier to operate 
len ratingone Anyway can get it back 
len ratingthree  I liked Google Chrome the way it was before this latest update 
len ratingthree I don t like it s new look and format it looks too much like Safari which I use only when I have to 
len ratingthree Keep security improvements yes but PLEASE return to your previous format 
len ratingtwo The new layout is disappointing 
len ratingtwo I understand why the buttons were moved to the bottom but I m not a fan 
len ratingtwo Maybe in a later update if not too difficult alter the program to let us choose button orientation top or bottom 
len ratingthree There s an old adage if it ain t broke don t fix it 
len ratingthree I ve never been a fan of changing an app s layout just for the sake of change 
len ratingthree You get used to something and then it changes and you have to relearn it 
len ratingthree For no reason 
len ratingthree I used to love when you open the tabs view and it was pages that you could easily swipe away 
len ratingthree Now I have to concentrate on a little x in a little box that is higher up on the screen 
len ratingthree I don t mind moving the tab button to the bottom for easier reach but bring back the previous tab view with swipe 
len ratingone Too safari like 
len ratingone Give me back the google chrome that I love 
len ratingone No one asked for this
len ratingone Today s update is crap 
len ratingone It keeps shutting down on its own and says I can restore 
len ratingone When the looks came out it worked great then today it s a mess 
len ratingone Please fix I spend a ton of time on Chrome 
len ratingone As the title states 
len ratingone It reminds me of Safari mobile which I hate and is the reason that I downloaded Chrome in the first place 
len ratingone The whole setup is awful and counterproductive 
len ratingone Just reverse the update 
len ratingone It s hardly worth having a second browser on my phone if they re just going to be equal levels of awful 
len ratingone I don t like the push of a completely different browser but under the same google that I used to like 
len ratingone No I don t like many aspects of the new updates 
len ratingfour Chrome surpassed IE and now Edge a long time ago 
len ratingfour Even on my iPad I prefer it to Safari but one thing I wish Chrome and Safari would allow the user to do is set the default to always give us the Desktop version of the sites we visit 
len ratingfour I hate having to go in for each site every time I open a new tab and telling it to give me the Desktop version 
len ratingfour I only go to Desktop versions 
len ratingfour I understand not everyone wants to pay for the extra data but I suspect there are many people out there like me who don t concern themselves with the extra data costs and need or want the full site 
len ratingfour Please give us the option to make that a default setting 
len ratingfive Nicer to look at easier to use
len ratingone This new update ruin my browsing view for certain webpages 
len ratingone All the fonts gone bonkers and its all huge 
len ratingone DO NOT UPDATE 
len ratingtwo Downloaded the updated chrome browser will not open GIS viewers from county websites useless as a full function mobile browser 
len ratingone  Have to echo other users here if I d wanted Safari I d be using Safari 
len ratingone Please give us back the Chrome we loved 
len ratingone It did not need fixing 
len ratingthree I don t like the new chrome it s just another word for Google 
len ratingthree I downloaded Chrome hoping that it would have be the grownup version of Google but now I open chrome and it s the same as Google 
len ratingone  You could once open PDFs you d downloaded right within Chrome 
len ratingone No more 
len ratingone Now you re just left to figure it out yourself via the Open In menu 
len ratingone To whomever decided that was a good idea it wasn t 
len ratingtwo With the most recent update they turned chrome mobile into safari mobile which I hate time to find a new browser until this gets changed 
len ratingone I used Chrome almost exclusively for its differences from Safari 
len ratingone This new update has removed that 
len ratingone Gone is the list view that made having multiple tabs open easy and accessible now with a nightmarish grid view where a simple swipe to dismiss is removed in favor of keeping the manual X out button 
len ratingone There s no way to remove the new buttons on the Google home screen 
len ratingone Google seems quite proud on displaying access to your browsing history and reading list at any given opportunity 
len ratingone The redesign is clunky unnecessary and absolutely kills any clean and basic functionality that Chrome had 
len ratingtwo First impressions are not good 
len ratingtwo The first thing I can see is the fonts on tabs are way smaller and hard to read 
len ratingtwo I see no reason that I have to figure out how to increase font size 
len ratingtwo Give me the Old Chrome 
len ratingthree I d truly like to go back to the old version 
len ratingthree I downloaded chrome so that I could listen to music when the screen is dimmed or if I m on another app but through YouTube it has the words manifest instead of random letters like if it were allowed to play outside of YouTube 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingthree I m sure many other people would like to listen to music and not focus on that singularly 
len ratingthree Other than that the app is amazing 
len ratingthree Good job 
len ratingone I ve worked as an interface programmer 
len ratingone I get that they ve done UI UX studies to show this new interface it s better and after we ve given it a chance it ll be better then the old blah blah blah 
len ratingone I don t want a bar on top and bottom 
len ratingone I don t use safari 
len ratingone I can t imagine there were users asking for this 
len ratingone Chrome team smack your new UI official who insisted this move would improve the app she or he was wrong 
len ratingone Please for all that is good in this world change it back 
len ratingone All you did was create a Safari clone 
len ratingone The reason I chose chrome was distance myself from that awful browser 
len ratingone Now I might as well go back so using it so much for chrome 
len ratingone Today is a sad day 
len ratingfive  Deleted 
len ratingone Another disgusting company where you are the product and they make the money 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingone Google wants to be Apple 
len ratingone The SOLE REASON I have Chrome was because of the navigation buttons were at the top 
len ratingone Now it s just like Safari 
len ratingone It s not a fresh new look 
len ratingone Looks like Safari 
len ratingone Obviously someone at Google wants to be Apple 
len ratingone Put the navigation bar back at the top 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone I ve already uninstalled it After using Chrome since 
len ratingone This new UI is absolutely garbage 
len ratingone Put it back the way it was 
len ratingone Literally no one asked for this 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingthree  Browse web page content frequently translation failure please repair thankyou 
len ratingone You should create some sort of swiping motion to close tabs 
len ratingone Right now the only option is tapping the x in the top right corner of the tab but it would be a bit more user friendly and faster if there were some sort of swiping motion that could close the tab 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingtwo It looks so ugly now why d they even need to do that 
len ratingtwo They just changed everything around to make it feel more like Safari which I don t use SPECIFICALLY because I don t like the layout 
len ratingtwo I never leave reviews because it s pointless but dear god please put Chrome back the way it was
len ratingfour Hey 
len ratingfour No issues with the software as a whole except one thing 
len ratingfour And it has been there as long as I can remember 
len ratingfour The close all tabs option 
len ratingfour It s ALWAYS been too close to the create new something or other and it doesn t ask if you re sure 
len ratingfour Important purchase you re working on gone 
len ratingfour Website you were saving for later gone 
len ratingfour Tabs you keep around just in case gone 
len ratingfour It just goes ahead and wipes everything 
len ratingfour And with the most recent update it s RIGHT NEXT TO THE CREATE NEW TAB OPTION 
len ratingfour Can we at least give it an extra alert that asks are you sure you want to delete all tabs As a computer programmer this isn t that hard 
len ratingfour Please I m begging you 
len ratingone I downloaded Chrome years ago because I loved the setup in comparison to the basic Safari app 
len ratingone They ve now decided to do my favorite thing every app does at least once and that s attempting to fix something that s not broken 
len ratingone Why make this change 
len ratingone Why make it mandatory and not give a design option 
len ratingone Terrible decision and I ll be deleting the app because it s now quite literally the same as Safari 
len ratingfive The design looks good on my laptop and iPad but I miss having all the buttons at the top but it s still hella good keep it up apple 
len ratingthree I liked how the older version showed more of my favorites quick picks on the home page 
len ratingthree Also the new back button arrow doesn t work well 
len ratingthree Have to press it a few times to go back
len ratingthree Seems like my screen was frozen so that s why I couldn t swipe it to incognito and regular easily it s fine now thank goodness 
len ratingthree I still do wish the task bar was at the top 
len ratingthree Again Its a little disorientating having it at the bottom for me 
len ratingthree Other than that everything seems okay 
len ratingthree Just got to get used to the redesign maybe 
len ratingfour Every time I load a webpage in the Chrome it crashes 
len ratingfour No matter what site I use it will crash 
len ratingfour I reload the page then it crashes again 
len ratingfour Once you fix this issue I will go back to using Chrome 
len ratingfour For now though I will switch to Safari 
len ratingthree The format is like Safari and I use chrome because I hate it 
len ratingthree It s also slow as hell 
len ratingone I wish I d known Chrome did a UI overhaul before I updated all my apps last night because I would have given this a hard pass 
len ratingone Why did you move the back forward buttons to the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone I used to be able to use one hand to go back to the previous page but now I have to use both hands 
len ratingone The placement of the back button used to be my favourite thing about Chrome I loved it BECAUSE it was more convenient than other browsers 
len ratingone Most of the other changes I m sure I ll adjust to but this one seriously affects the usability of the app for me 
len ratingone Why does the browser crash when trying to upload documents
len ratingthree This newest upgrade look with the buttons on the bottom and the tabs as tiles I hate it 
len ratingthree So stinking much I want my old version back 
len ratingone  Nice vehicle for ad delivery google 
len ratingone  Why would you copy the design of another app 
len ratingone Specifically an app that we all bypassed to download chrome 
len ratingone Chrome kept your tabs in order it was neat and linear 
len ratingone Now it s all over the place and stuff isn t where it even remotely used to be 
len ratingone I can t easily bookmark a page anymore you have to scroll and get it 
len ratingone I can t find where my old tabs were anymore 
len ratingone I don t immediately use the search button so why is that front and center 
len ratingone It s not intuitive it s completely backwards from what everyone is used to 
len ratingone Why would you change your mobile app to something that looks completely different from your desktop version 
len ratingone Because you think you need to change your browser every year 
len ratingone You got rid of half of the site suggestions that we could personalize to unremovable mandatory suggestions by the app 
len ratingone This was stupid 
len ratingone You want chrome to be so customizable but it seems like every release you come up with you take more and more options away 
len ratingone What are you going to do next change symbols and their meanings so you can be cool and hip and confuse everyone some more 
len ratingone Frustrating is what this is 
len ratingone I can t for the life of me understand why they would redesign the UI to be more like safari 
len ratingone I hate safari that s why I used chrome 
len ratingone Google chrome is a great browser and the mobile version for iOS is easy and pleasant to use 
len ratingone However in the latest version of my my writing the scroll back to top feature present in most mobile apps by tapping the very top of the screen no longer works in landscape orientation 
len ratingone It still works in portrait orientation but it s annoying to have to turn my phone upright if I want to go back to the top 
len ratingone Hopefully this will be fixed soon 
len ratingone  Building a censored internet for the communist Chinese 
len ratingone Manipulating search results in this country 
len ratingone Openly working against the sitting President 
len ratingone Tracking banning censorship on and on 
len ratingone That s google 
len ratingone Google is 
len ratingone Orwellian of the highest order 
len ratingone I made the mistake of updating the app 
len ratingone Apparently Goole is trying to look like Safari 
len ratingone I don t use Safari because I don t like the layout nor how it maneuvers 
len ratingone Since I am being forced to utilize Safaris layout I will is their app and remove Google as I don t need two of the same using my storage 
len ratingone I liked google chrome because I don t like safari now they just copied them
len ratingone  As a long time android user one of the biggest draws for me to use the chrome app was the fact that the UI was consistent and the top tabs was more practical for use on the iphone SE size of iphone 
len ratingone The new update ruins this and makes the browser experience substantially more clunky 
len ratingone Please go back to google chrome being google chrome not safari updatesucks
len ratingtwo Chrome has been my go to browser on my phone for years 
len ratingtwo However recently it has started to load pages and then the content disappears and the page is left blank 
len ratingtwo As a result I can t use it reliably any more and have to switch 
len ratingtwo Also I preferred the old version because it displayed the top sites that I visited instead of just 
len ratingtwo The app is now the same as safari after the most recent update so don t waste your time 
len ratingtwo Used to be great but the new interface gets rid of any reason to use it 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would 
len ratingone I specifically downloaded chrome bc I hate the layout of Safari and now it s just a copycat 
len ratingone Like the way it was since this newly updated design have hard time finding the back button or forward even to close 
len ratingone Am not pleased with this new design think will go elsewhere if this isnt fixed soon 
len ratingone I ll be looking for a new browser after the completely unnecessary and terrible new reorganizing of chrome s layout 
len ratingone Definitely was great until the new update as of September th 
len ratingone Literally nobody asked for this new ui overhaul 
len ratingone Nothing was wrong with the old one 
len ratingone The reason chrome exists is for it to be a browser and as a browser google chrome was pretty complete beforehand 
len ratingone It was easy to use and everyone got used to the old ui 
len ratingone I know companies do often change up the ui s of their products to bring life back into them but chrome doesn t need it 
len ratingthree One of the most frustrating things about this browser is that it doesn t always recognize phone numbers on a page 
len ratingthree I use a web app for my job and have to call customers 
len ratingthree In safari the numbers are recognized and I can press to call 
len ratingthree In chrome I have to highlight copy and paste into the phone app which is very cumbersome 
len ratingthree I still use chrome because it is the better of the two overall 
len ratingthree Please update this app to include this feature and it will be perfect 
len ratingone WHY ARE THE CONTROLS AT THE BOTTOM NOW 
len ratingone When my keyboard gets stuck I cant go back or change tabs or anything It looks nice but the controls are in an inconvenient spot 
len ratingone I cant scroll and go back because it disappears 
len ratingone Please put it back at the top where it belongs 
len ratingone This is some android bs 
len ratingthree Don t get me wrong the app runs flawlessly but it s now complicated to use all the functions that were easily accessible are now hidden under buttons or menus 
len ratingthree This is exactly how you make a good app complicated to use for no reason 
len ratingthree It s installed but the icon is gone from the desktop 
len ratingone Why in the world did you guys decide to copy safari 
len ratingone The whole reason I used chrome is because the interface was better than safari this is awful please go back
len ratingone As if some of us didn t have much screen space to begin with you f ers take more away by adding a pointless bar at the bottom of the screen to make searching easier news flash f tards the f ing address bar doubles as a search bar hate the new format finding a new browser
len ratingtwo Go back to what it was 
len ratingtwo As with many I had to check I wasn t using Safari
len ratingone Not sure why but it keeps crashing on my phone 
len ratingone I don t like it at all 
len ratingone It was fine the way it was 
len ratingone The layout is terrible 
len ratingone Not happy at all 
len ratingtwo Googles old motto was do no evil 
len ratingtwo At some point they lost their way 
len ratingtwo Too much tracking and giving up privacy with google products including chrome that just want to use you as a product to be manipulate in subtitle ways 
len ratingtwo Other browsers may not have quite as many bells or whistles 
len ratingtwo But I will survive 
len ratingone Used to be able to share a web page to OneNote and the entire web page would be printed out within the OneNote page 
len ratingone This new version only copies the web page link on to the OneNote page 
len ratingtwo Why change to look and flow if it works 
len ratingtwo Thanks but no thanks
len ratingthree Not a huge fan of the new interface 
len ratingthree I m a huge believer in if it ain t broke don t fix it 
len ratingone Don t update if you have over tabs 
len ratingone I ve had tabs open for about years now and once i updated I lost them all 
len ratingone Recent tabs shows nothing either 
len ratingone So depressing 
len ratingone I wouldn t be using Chrome if I liked Safari please change it back 
len ratingthree Don t developers realize changing the UI after several years is bad practice 
len ratingthree Nothing is where you re used to it being 
len ratingthree In addition it randomly goes black for no reason and doesn t respond 
len ratingone  No add ons no stars
len ratingone Sadly after the new update I d rather go back to Safari it s been years 
len ratingone The layout is a little strange and I could probably get used to it but the bar seems to stick to the bottom rather inconveniently when I m trying to read comics which is a lot of what I do 
len ratingone It s really easy to bump the close all tabs option even if that s not what I want I still don t get suggestions in the search bar my only complaint before and I liked being able to swipe to close tabs 
len ratingone It s just sad that it basically go updated to be closer to everything else when I liked it because it was just different enough 
len ratingfive Squ according
len ratingone No thanks 
len ratingone Uninstalling 
len ratingone New layout is crap go back to where he previous layout 
len ratingone WHAT IS THIS CRAP 
len ratingone WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE UI AGAIN 
len ratingone NOW ITS EVEN WORSE TO USE 
len ratingone I hate safari and never use it and never planned on it and now chrome looks and operates just like it please please please go back to the way it was or give an option to choose to have the old version on please it s been the same my entire life and now you guys changed the entire layout 
len ratingone Not every app needs to be updated or changed there was no reason to fix something that wasn t broken and then make it worse 
len ratingone To go back to the old sane design type Chrome flags in the address bar set UI refresh phase to Disabled and restart browser 
len ratingone Hope there is never a phase 
len ratingfour The older tabs were iconic of real vintage folder tabs and outlined so well 
len ratingfour Why the change 
len ratingone I hate this update 
len ratingone I would give stars if possible
len ratingone  Every time I see an update pop up I excitedly hope it s a removal fix for what was forced out a week or so ago 
len ratingone Or at the very least a response to all the complaints would be nice with a message that rollbacks actual improvements are coming 
len ratingone Please revert this Safari copycat 
len ratingone PLEASE 
len ratingone Again if we wanted to be using Safari we would been doing so already 
len ratingthree I switched chrome to link my phone with my home and work browsers 
len ratingthree I already like many features of safari mobile 
len ratingthree  things I ve noticed one is that I miss the reading feature where safari would remove all the extra junk on a site page to read with out adds all around 
len ratingthree Second is that some mobile sites are zoomed in to far to where you don t see everything safari did not have this issue 
len ratingone Chrome is constantly reloading the page aw snap error
len ratingtwo I ve gotta admit the new UI is neat but the first thing I thought when I first saw it was Did I open Safari 
len ratingtwo This new update makes Chrome look more generic than ever now including a bottom bar for functions which is really uncomfortable for single handed usage 
len ratingtwo For smaller phones and tablets it may not be a problem but the right thumb s reach over to go back a page is abysmal and the left hand has to shift the entire phone for the left thumb to reach 
len ratingtwo  this varies depending on how you browse There seriously needs to at least be an option to put everything on the top bar like in the previous update 
len ratingone Can t open when pressing on open after downloading
len ratingone When I try to open a new browser it will minimize and I m not able to tap on it to open the website 
len ratingone It just freezes and I have to close everything and reopen a new browser 
len ratingfive Please don t revert back to the old version 
len ratingfive I have no idea why people are rating this version poorly because it s so thoughtfully designed and by far the best mobile browsing experience to date 
len ratingfive I can finally reach everything with my thumb 
len ratingfive I m not a fan of the UI changes but I can deal with it 
len ratingfive However every other web page I pull up is bugged and all the controls go away 
len ratingfive I can t change tabs or use my navigation buttons so I just have to swipe up and to the side to close the tab and pick another 
len ratingfive It s really annoying 
len ratingfive Edit Issue has stopped for me so I ve restored my star rating 
len ratingtwo The latest update makes Chrome essentially a Safari clone in looks 
len ratingtwo I absolutely hated the safari browser which was why I used Chrome in the first place 
len ratingtwo I do like some features like the new tabs screen but the bottom bar is just so awkward 
len ratingtwo I would at least like to be able to customize that 
len ratingone Auto Updated New Chrome 
len ratingone Looks and feels like the free version of an overpriced app 
len ratingone Looks aside the improvements mentioned here were not included in the rollout I received but they did manage to take away any all functionality of the more menu 
len ratingone Thanks for nothing
len ratingfive They have finally moved all navigation buttons to the bottom 
len ratingone Chrome I loved you 
len ratingone Until you changed 
len ratingone I HATE the new layout 
len ratingone It s an eyesore and poorly laid out 
len ratingone Please let me go back to the pre update version
len ratingfive It s so much more intuitive 
len ratingfive So easy to use 
len ratingfive Please keep it 
len ratingfive I can even request a desktop view 
len ratingfive The incognito and recent tab are very easy to spot as well 
len ratingfive I love the design so much that I m actually reviewing the app 
len ratingfive This is my first time so it says a lot for a lazy person like me to take the time to review this app 
len ratingfive It means I m very impressed 
len ratingfive Keep improving Chrome 
len ratingthree Things feels off 
len ratingthree Even feels like the chrome team is trying to copy Baidu 
len ratingone Bad update revert to old UI 
len ratingone Google Chrome has been my go to app since the day I got a smart phone 
len ratingone This update is the equivalent of the Minnesota Vikings performance against the Bills today 
len ratingone Dumpster FIRE 
len ratingone it is a terrible idea that update the app 
len ratingone new version looks ugly
len ratingone I was a loyal chrome user on my iPhones since my iPhone was new 
len ratingone But this new Chrome is terrible 
len ratingone The worst browser I have ever used 
len ratingone It s slow it s buggy and it doesn t even load at times 
len ratingone I will never use it again 
len ratingone That s the problem today folks have forgotten the saying If it ain t broke don t fix it People just love to change things for the sake of changing things 
len ratingone Too bad Google what a colossal waste of your time AND a death nail to the best browser 
len ratingtwo can t swipe to close tabs anymore i guess because of the firefox clone tab view how do i close lots of tabs now 
len ratingtwo seems like a lot of negative reviews with this version 
len ratingtwo makes me think it wasn t use tested at all
len ratingone  This update that comes with iOS is one of the most dysfunctional updates ever 
len ratingone So hard to get used to it and so unorganized 
len ratingone It doesn t work
len ratingone Not better than Safari 
len ratingone For reasons unknown the devs decided to ruin everything good about Chrome 
len ratingone  With the new update I keep thinking I ve opened safari by accident 
len ratingone I m not a fan of the layout again why I didn t use safari in the first place 
len ratingone Many pages are now unresponsive to touch as well for example trying to expand sections of a Wikipedia article just may or may not work 
len ratingone Hopefully the anti trust suit will take off MAGA
len ratingfive  This new layout on my iPhone is great in accessing key features I use every day with one hand 
len ratingfive This update matches many of the features that l love in the iOS safari browser 
len ratingfive Thanks dev team 
len ratingfive Would it be possible to add the bookmark button to the main menu 
len ratingfive Or a option to switch the search button with the bookmark button 
len ratingone I don t know what they did but it s a horrible update 
len ratingone Go back to the old chrome that s how we all fell in love with 
len ratingone This is just too much the new tab mode is annoying the swiping is unnecessary 
len ratingone Also buggy at time when trying to browse iPhone device for things like resumes uploads and photos 
len ratingone An essential feature removed in the latest redesign 
len ratingone Someone needs to be fired for this 
len ratingone Another bug introduced in the redesign some videos don t play inside the browser but play when maximized 
len ratingone Opened my phone today and my Google Chrome looks almost exactly like Safari 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would of used that app 
len ratingone Could not figure out a way to revert back 
len ratingone If there isn t a way to revert back or we re not given a way to revert back I m going to just uninstall this app 
len ratingone It s worthless to me if it s just going to clone Safari which is horrible 
len ratingfour The new look is trash change it back to the old one 
len ratingtwo One of the main reasons I don t use safari other than I use chrome on everything is the location of the navigation buttons 
len ratingtwo Every good browser ever has the buttons at the top and always have 
len ratingtwo I understand that some people may like buttons at the bottom for reachability but please give us a choice 
len ratingtwo I hate it and wish I could roll back my install
len ratingthree I understand that change is inevitable 
len ratingthree But give us the option to go back to the classic design or at least the option to put the controls back up top 
len ratingthree Switching tabs was much easier in the old layout 
len ratingone I downloaded Chrome because I hate Safari have used it for years 
len ratingone The latest update turned it into a Safari lookalike probably will change to Firefox if they don t charge it back 
len ratingone I hate the new look and appearance
len ratingfour It looks so nice and I m so grateful for the tab grid 
len ratingfour It s very helpful 
len ratingone For many years chrome has been the go to for mobile browsers with standardization across multiple mobile operating systems 
len ratingone This new update is atrocious and rearranging things just for the sake of change is a terrible trend of failing companies 
len ratingone Thank you for copying safari s layout 
len ratingone Now I have the great opportunity to look for another web browser instead of this one 
len ratingone Great Job 
len ratingone  It keeps telling me my e mail not valid even though I can sign on under safari 
len ratingone Google continues to make bizarre design choices that upset their users desktop browser also suffered 
len ratingone I used to use chrome even though I have an iOS device because I don t like the set up of safari and now chrome look like safari and I don t know what to do 
len ratingone It s kind of confusing now I like the tool bar and the setting at the top right
len ratingone Years ago I used to use safari as my iPhone s browser and then it got an update that made it incredibly user unfriendly and clunky and now this chrome update makes chrome just like all the things I HATE about safari 
len ratingone I literally started to cry in frustration this is so horrible
len ratingtwo I dislike the new bottom bar 
len ratingtwo I have to scroll to bookmark something now and after I bookmark something I have to wait for the edit bar to go away before I can hit the back button 
len ratingtwo I also can t tell the time when I hold my phone sideways 
len ratingtwo I ve already almost been late to work twice 
len ratingone Used to be very solid but the new design is horrible UI 
len ratingone Also way slower than previous versions 
len ratingone Really too slow to be usable 
len ratingtwo Please fix the crashes
len ratingtwo I use to use this app all the time for its style and how it had a nice sharp look that was simple 
len ratingtwo But now they have turned it into a non colored safari app and I feel as if my screen has gotten smaller when i read on chrome
len ratingfive  I love google chrome because I don t want to say it but yeah all of u people who say google chrome is stupid or useless ur wrong ur the useless one and it is not a bitchin thing maging or what ever it is better then e which I don t know wth it stands for but I just know that it is better than that if ur reading this don t write a bad report or don t give a five star if u are reading this give it a five star right a GOOD report about it like I am right now and tell those other people who don t like google chrome to do the same THING ok ok 
len ratingthree It would be great to have a home button for google chrome on iPad Pro
len ratingone This update is horrendous and makes me want to delete chrome 
len ratingone I ve always been a chrome user because I hate safari and not there s practically no difference 
len ratingtwo I have Googlized my entire iPhone but this new version of Chrome is definitely a step backwards toward Safari 
len ratingtwo Tab Grid looks pretty but is a waste of time and screen space 
len ratingtwo Menu at the bottom 
len ratingtwo More time wasted 
len ratingtwo I may as well just use Safari by Apple instead of Safari by Google 
len ratingtwo Very disappointing 
len ratingthree  Gifs don t play or enlarge on google images They use to open up when you click which was better 
len ratingthree But chrome is much easier to navigate now finally with bottom screen forward and backward buttons 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone Why is there a need to completely change the location of buttons 
len ratingone I use Chrome because it was simple and practical 
len ratingone Now you completely change everything and I have to go back to just using Safari 
len ratingone  I ve never used the Safari app because I just don t like the design now Google goes and changes their app and it feels just like Safari s app needless to say I hate it 
len ratingone Hate hate hate it 
len ratingtwo The new design is basically a clone of safari 
len ratingtwo Everything is changed layout of menus and buttons and open tabs entire visual design aesthetic screen interactions nothing remains the same from the chrome app I ve used for years over anything else available 
len ratingtwo I still use it because of habit but that s all 
len ratingtwo It feels awkward now and you have to be more precise in tapping buttons 
len ratingtwo Actually everything is more difficult to accomplish especially bookmarking a website and opening closing a new tab 
len ratingtwo It just feels cramped and every action I regularly take is hidden in a menu I have to scroll through 
len ratingtwo Speaking of the main menu for taking actions like bookmarking or find in page its all just crammed into an overflow menu the button that you have to scroll through 
len ratingtwo There s no organization whatsoever and everything is just jumbled up 
len ratingtwo I ve been using this update for like a week now and still have to search for what I want and regularly use 
len ratingtwo LET ME ROLL BACK TO PREVIOUS VERSION PLEASE 
len ratingone It is slower to load and sometimes doesn t load pages at all 
len ratingone Google search sits and spins with no redirect to the search results 
len ratingone The bottoms half of pages no longer load 
len ratingone Overall a really bad change to an app that was working just fine 
len ratingone the new design of the app is garbage don t know why google changed old design
len ratingone I deviated to google chrome from the standard safari browser to get away from the bottom menu I felt it took away from the focal content s initial introduction and now I just feel forced to use safari s double menu feature all over again
len ratingthree The update its not good he is so slow
len ratingone  Every time I see an update pop up I excitedly hope it s a removal fix for what was forced out a week or so ago 
len ratingone Or at the very least a response to all the complaints 
len ratingone Please revert this Safari copycat mess 
len ratingone PLEASE 
len ratingone If Google is trying to copy Safari than I will just start using Safari 
len ratingone Is there a way to reload older versions of Chrome 
len ratingone I loved Chrome because it was similar to the desktop version 
len ratingone Now it s just like Safari which I hate 
len ratingone Why redesign something that wasn t broken 
len ratingone New format is horrible 
len ratingone Might as well use Safari which is also garbage
len ratingtwo  So dumb 
len ratingtwo Before it was cool and reminded me of the PC desktop version 
len ratingtwo Now it just reminds me of the annoying safari app it s garbage 
len ratingtwo Gonna switch to Firefox or one of the other browser apps until they unf this s 
len ratingfive I never thought I would write a review about a browser certainly not chrome which is not only my favorite but rarely has issues to report but this update 
len ratingfive UGHHHH LOOOVVE IT 
len ratingfive I had no idea it could get better 
len ratingfive So sexy and sleek and I just can t get over having all the features I need at the bottom 
len ratingfive In the age of bigger and taller phones it s a small change that makes a big difference 
len ratingfive Yes yes a thousand times YES 
len ratingfive Take THAT Safari 
len ratingfive  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingfive If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingone I do not like the safari browser 
len ratingone At all 
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingone Why does this matter on a Chrome review 
len ratingone Because the latest update that was forced down my throat i e 
len ratingone updated by itself without my permission have updates turned off looks almost identical to the F ing safari browser 
len ratingone I HATE it 
len ratingone H A T E it 
len ratingone How do I switch it back to the older version 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use Safari I would 
len ratingtwo I loved the previous interface with most of the components up top 
len ratingtwo The app looked cleaner navigation was comfortable Now I just feel like I m back to using Safari 
len ratingtwo Sure I ll get used to it for the sake of my sync d bookmarks but despite having a large phone I still prefer the previous setup 
len ratingone Was a pretty sweet alternative to Safari 
len ratingone Now the UI is a copy of Safari s 
len ratingone No longer has worth 
len ratingfive I know not everything is about looks but man 
len ratingfive This new update makes me want to use chrome all the time instead of my others browsers Really Nice Update Thank You 
len ratingfive The update is just amazing great one yet
len ratingone  Controls are in a terrible place now bottom left 
len ratingone It almost impossible to go back a webpage with one hand 
len ratingfive Best Google Chrome Ever For iPhone
len ratingone  If you long time in a page or scroll up down this app lost href 
len ratingone Helpful only reload page 
len ratingone This is not user friendly 
len ratingone Really hate that they put the back button and everything else at the bottom 
len ratingone Really do not like the new design 
len ratingone This has been said many times already but the new update reminds me of safari 
len ratingone The reason I use google chrome on an iPhone is because I honestly hate safari so this update doesn t appeal to me 
len ratingone I liked the full tab page view of the previous version it was clean and easy 
len ratingone This tab page looks messy with many tabs open 
len ratingone A big reason I liked chrome over safari was because when you scrolled the name of the website wasn t set at the top and went away 
len ratingone In this version you can see the website name which I don t like because if someone were to look at my phone they can see what I m looking at 
len ratingone Have been a big fan however over the last few months I have been getting malicious pop ups 
len ratingone Within about minutes of loading and using the new version there was a pop up that appeared and I had to delete the ap 
len ratingtwo  I dislike the new bottom bar 
len ratingtwo I have to scroll to bookmark something now and after I bookmark something I have to wait for the edit bar to go away before I can hit the back button 
len ratingthree After new design it s very hard to browse heavy web pages 
len ratingthree Irresponsible touch unsmooth animation etc 
len ratingthree s iso 
len ratingtwo I loved the google app before this new update 
len ratingtwo I hated my safari app because controls were at the bottom but google had them at the top 
len ratingtwo The new update makes it work just like safari 
len ratingtwo Why would I keep using this if it s the same as the one I don t like 
len ratingtwo Re lode
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would have been using Safari 
len ratingone Now they are both equally as confusing to navigate 
len ratingone Please don t change the layout for Android I m changing to that soon 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome because it was exceptional now it s just safari like whatever it is 
len ratingone Please make chrome old again 
len ratingone I don t need to be irritated by my web browser 
len ratingone I ve preferred Chrome for eons and the new layout is awful 
len ratingone Either it s gone or I haven t figure out how to swipe the pages I m done with 
len ratingone Choosing a tiny x is the most annoying thing to me 
len ratingone Accessing tabs like others have said I d use safari if I wanted safari 
len ratingone Please update and undo these changes soon 
len ratingone I haven t uninstalled yet because I m hoping the outcry will get to you 
len ratingone I scroll about third of the way down pages and ten am brought back to the top of the page and cannot read any further fix this the last version was perfect before oh redesigned everything without telling anyone
len ratingtwo  The new update is just a copy of Safari 
len ratingtwo In that case it makes more sense for me to save space on my phone by uninstalling Chrome and relying solely on Safari 
len ratingtwo Please move the toolbar back to the top of the window 
len ratingtwo Otherwise it s counterintuitive to move from the top of the screen to type a URL then the bottom of the screen to open a new tab 
len ratingthree If I wanted Safari I d use Safari 
len ratingthree I liked your app because I preferred the interface but instead you decided to give us the Safari one 
len ratingthree Be different 
len ratingthree That s why people use you instead of the default browser 
len ratingfour I love the Chrome app and will continue to use it instead of Safari 
len ratingfour However I ve recently been receiving more spam pop ups that require me to delete the Chrome app entirely and download again in order to avoid clicking the pop up 
len ratingfour Relaunching the app and trying to access a new tab via a link from an email have both proven unsuccessful workarounds 
len ratingfour Unfortunately without the ability to disable HTML deleting the app seems to be the only way to get around these pop ups which is pretty inconvenient 
len ratingone I don t like the most updated version 
len ratingone It reminds me to much of Safari and I hate that search engine the layout just feels weird 
len ratingone I loved the old layout for Google Chrome now not so much
len ratingtwo Tried it for a week 
len ratingtwo Was days too long 
len ratingtwo The simplicity of the regular google app makes it a better option 
len ratingone The browser screen layout imitates other browser apps and it s just unsightly 
len ratingone I haven t encountered any bugs but I m not going to be using chrome as my primary browser anymore 
len ratingone If there was an option to use the old layout maybe
len ratingtwo The most recent update has given Chrome some new functions but it is constantly crashing 
len ratingtwo What the deal people 
len ratingtwo I really dislike the look and feel of the new version of Chrome 
len ratingtwo I wish I could roll it back to the previous version 
len ratingone This browser is nearly unusable now 
len ratingone So frustrating 
len ratingone Why is all the navigation at the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone Why do I have to scroll up to get the option to go back 
len ratingone Why is it a crappier version of safari 
len ratingone I m switching to Firefox 
len ratingone This update is ridiculous it looks very juvenile 
len ratingone Important sites that I need to use frequently aren t recognizing Chrome as a compatible browser now even though Chrome is listed as one when the error pops up 
len ratingone Why do companies always have to fix things that aren t broken 
len ratingone I hate the new version 
len ratingone It keeps minimizing my page and closing it out 
len ratingone I m using from my iPhone 
len ratingone I don t like what you flouts fid at all 
len ratingone Put it back like it was 
len ratingone Reminds me of the bubble shaped windows and lights on an early s Taurus 
len ratingone  Popup blocker seems to be broken after the recent update 
len ratingone I have been a big fan of Chrome on iOS since it was released 
len ratingone In fact it has been my primary interface on all of my devices for a while now 
len ratingone This new interface is going to change that for iOS 
len ratingone When the PC interface update dropped I was a bit annoyed 
len ratingone Like most people I don t like change 
len ratingone However after using it for a while I quickly found it was mostly the look that changes the overall navigation and menus stayed mostly the same 
len ratingone Fast forward to the iOS update where menu items have been moved buttons repositioned on the screen making it more difficult to use single handed 
len ratingone This is a painful change to the browsing experience 
len ratingone Now I need to spend the rest of my day downloading browsers 
len ratingone Is Brave on iOS yet 
len ratingone New UI bezels are too thick and make the entire browsing experience feel dumbed down 
len ratingtwo Who is the idiot who thought they should make the Chrome interface look just like Safari 
len ratingtwo This latest update looks and feels like Safari which I loathe 
len ratingtwo Stop doing the most with these updates and do only what s necessary 
len ratingone Thanks to recent updates it s literally a safari clone 
len ratingone That s cool i guess 
len ratingone Before and after installing the latest version I get constant crashes 
len ratingone The best literally won t work at all now 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and reinstalled twice now 
len ratingone Anyone else having this happen 
len ratingone Is it because I m using the Gboard keyboard 
len ratingone Whenever I try to attach my resume from Google Drive Chrome freezes up 
len ratingone Ruined the computer version and all my links including those linked to my phone 
len ratingone  I m not someone to take time out of my day to leave a app review 
len ratingone But recently chrome has been giving me a lot of trouble with reopening previously deleted websites from my history 
len ratingone First time was when I was birthday shopping for my girlfriend using an incognito tab 
len ratingone She used my phone and as soon as she opened it boom the present I was looking at 
len ratingone What finally made me snap was when I opened my phone in public only to be greeted by the porn I watched the day before play with full sound after I cleared my history 
len ratingone I am also pretty tech savvy and have been using chrome for years 
len ratingone I know what I m doing I haven t had problems before but please please update your app to correct this issue 
len ratingone As for myself I will be using safari until further notice I urge anyone reading this to do so as well until a newer version comes out that resolves this issue 
len ratingfour Hey Google We appreciate your effort to make the application better but in the latest new update chrome gets slow loading and launching and there are few glitches as well which make little unsteady 
len ratingfour If you could look in to this and make the bugs clear wit the new IOS and upcoming versions it may helpful for us and community 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo The old design was great everything s location made sense and was easy to find and use looked nice and felt nice to use 
len ratingtwo Why in the world did you feel the need to completely redesign something that wasn t in need of a change in the first place 
len ratingtwo Do you really need to copy Apple that bad 
len ratingtwo You had a great thing going you decided to go and screw it up for no reason at all 
len ratingfive It s a great app my favorite browser 
len ratingfive The new update is so extreme though 
len ratingfive Like thank you for moving everything around and making it look unlike every other web browser 
len ratingfive I get what they were going for but it just throws me off if I have to switch browsers 
len ratingtwo Why does my chrome suddenly look like a skinned version of safari 
len ratingtwo I use chrome because I like chrome I also hate safari anything more similar to safari is a bad choice in my book 
len ratingtwo I am going to sound old when I say this but I don t want to have to relearn how to use this interface stop trying to retrain me 
len ratingtwo If I wanted this interface I would just use Safari 
len ratingone Hate the stupid new update would not recommend
len ratingfive Love This App 
len ratingfive So Easy to Use 
len ratingfive I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT 
len ratingone The new update has essentially made Google Chrome unexceptional inconvenient to use extremely frustrating and simply a disaster 
len ratingone Whoever s idea it was to re vamp the layout design and operating style had zero sense of practically and innovation 
len ratingone It s basically Safari and in all the worst ways they ruined Chrome s functionality and uniqueness 
len ratingone Web pages take FOREVER to load and it s the same couple pages time and again no internet connectivity issues either and no harmful or risky websites were visited 
len ratingone Never had this problem before 
len ratingone Please return to original Chrome 
len ratingone Until then uninstalling 
len ratingtwo I hate change and moving every button to a completely different place all at once does not fly with me 
len ratingtwo How does it not compute with app developers that iPhone use is muscle memory 
len ratingtwo You can t just change everything and expect it to be fine 
len ratingtwo especially when the redesign essentially made the chrome app exactly the same as safari in a slightly different skin 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingone I Cannot use my keyboard 
len ratingone it is no longer entering letters or numbers it looks totally different and I m running into a whole slew of other problems I have windows on my pc it all started when I downloaded the new chrome on my iPhone
len ratingtwo I really dislike the new updated Chrome 
len ratingtwo I ve been trying unsuccessfully to fill out this form online 
len ratingtwo I have to attach a file from my Google Drive and I haven t been allowed to do it 
len ratingtwo Whenever I try to attach the file the screen becomes tiny and then freeze 
len ratingtwo Before this whole update thing I NEVER had that problem 
len ratingone I agree with everyone saying it feels like Safari 
len ratingone The way the tabs are presented look totally like Safari 
len ratingone I m using Chrome because I don t like the Safari interface why would you do this 
len ratingone It s also more inconvenient to reload pages now 
len ratingone Not that big of a deal but for someone like me who has a lot of shipments I use the reload button a lot on tracking pages 
len ratingtwo  I love Chrome but the update is terrible 
len ratingtwo I love chrome because it was nothing like Safari now it s exactly the same 
len ratingtwo How do I roll this terrible update back to the last version 
len ratingone I hateeeeeeeeeeeeee the new update ahhhh 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Must people use google because they hate safari and now it s literally the same thing as safari 
len ratingone I feel betrayed google 
len ratingone Google Chrome is far better than safari but after this update I am switching back to safari because of the horrendous user interface change it has truly made google chrome the ugliest browser please add an option for users to switch back 
len ratingtwo While I like the ability to reorder pages I don t like anything else about the new update 
len ratingtwo It reminds me of Safari and if I wanted Safari I would use it instead of taking up storage space with another browser app 
len ratingone New format is horrible just like Safari 
len ratingone Once favorite browser now like all the others in formatting 
len ratingone Removes of reason to use Chrome now 
len ratingone Can you revert to the old formatting or at least make what formatting is used an option like for Gmail 
len ratingone It s too much like Safari 
len ratingone I downloaded the google chrome because it was easier for me to use 
len ratingone Now it s not 
len ratingone I wish it was back the way it was 
len ratingthree Like some directions of the redesign but overall feels rough and not chrome like 
len ratingthree I thought I opened Safari at first 
len ratingthree The way they do tab switch is particularly bad 
len ratingone I never expected Chrome to turn into Safari Why do you copy Apple 
len ratingfour Only request would be a dark mode option for the browser 
len ratingone UI is less intuitive 
len ratingone Bottom bar reminds me of Safari which I never use 
len ratingone Old version was my favorite and most used app not just among browsers 
len ratingone I could probably get used to the round edges in time but I don t think it s a good look 
len ratingone Not sure I ll bother trying to get used to it 
len ratingone I ll just use my Chromebook for web surfing 
len ratingone The only reason I downloaded Chrome when O first switched to a smart phone was because I liked the design 
len ratingone I hated using Safari because of the design 
len ratingone Now Chrome is basically the same as Safari 
len ratingone Will be looking to get a new web browser 
len ratingtwo The new UI is disappointing
len ratingone The new look is horrid 
len ratingone It s like a kiddy version of Safari 
len ratingone  the functionality of the new look is clunky disappointing too 
len ratingone I ve been a fan of Chrome for many years now because having everything connected smoothly to my Google account is handy but the new desktop version is wretched as is the new Gmail look so I ll be searching for other options 
len ratingone I seriously have NO idea of what they were thinking with this massive overhaul 
len ratingone It all looks like it was designed by children years ago and have added no features that make it worth it 
len ratingone  An essential feature removed in the latest redesign 
len ratingone Someone needs to be fired for this 
len ratingone I hate it
len ratingone The update ruined the app it is very glitchy now 
len ratingone Google please fix this 
len ratingone Also make it an option to use the older version of the browser 
len ratingone I used chrome because I hated safari 
len ratingone Now they re too much the same
len ratingone Chrome should not touch the app because the app was looking better than before they change it and where are used to browse at the top now everything is down at the bottom I do not like 
len ratingtwo The new UI resembles Safari too much for me 
len ratingone Does not allow custom search engines has no option for DuckDuckGo 
len ratingone Maybe Google feels threatened 
len ratingone Good thing DDG has their own browser will uninstall Chrome 
len ratingthree Please remove the close all tabs button from the bottom of the screen 
len ratingthree I ve already accidentally closed all tabs x and its horrifying trying to relocate and reopen them all 
len ratingthree I keep multiple tabs open for good reasons so it is extremely frustrating when they all close so easily 
len ratingthree It is nice however to finally be able to reorganize the order of the tabs but the old layering of the tabs would have been much easier to scroll view and find the tabs needed 
len ratingthree The new layout is too clunky for having lots of tabs 
len ratingone  I don t know what they did but it s a horrible update 
len ratingone Go back to the old chrome that s how we all fell in love with 
len ratingone This is just too much the new tab mode is annoying the swiping is unnecessary 
len ratingone The new design is horrible and looks like safari 
len ratingone Please get back to the older one
len ratingone I originally downloaded this so I didn t have to use safari and the newest update turned it into safari I recommend just using real safari over this knock off
len ratingone  Randomly decide to switch to a radically new design out of nowhere 
len ratingone Sweet 
len ratingtwo dont wanna bottom ui at all 
len ratingfour Moved search buttons to the bottom 
len ratingfour Finally 
len ratingfour Makes sense with bigger phones to make this move 
len ratingfour I know it sounds simple but I m not sure why it took google so long to do this 
len ratingfour Happy it s here now 
len ratingone This Update s UI is terrible 
len ratingone Keep the old one 
len ratingone I ve tried to use it and it won t let me adjust my bookmarks the correct way 
len ratingone Every time I try to favorite something it saves it in the wrong space and I can t edit it at all 
len ratingone I use Google Chrome on my iPhone because Safari is garbage and all these changes have made it as worse as safari now 
len ratingone If I wanted the safari layout I would have just kept using the stock browser 
len ratingone I ll continue to use chrome because of the integration but I m a fan of the chrome layout not the safari layout y all copied
len ratingtwo Chrome is my go to browser both on my mac and iPhone but the best experience has shifted dramatically towards the desktop version of chrome 
len ratingtwo The iOS update placing the same basic navigation toolbar as safari 
len ratingtwo Just generally feels as a shadow of safari 
len ratingtwo Does not feel like chrome 
len ratingtwo Sad
len ratingone  The newest update is the worst Google Chrome I ve seen yet 
len ratingone The layout looks far too much like Safari an app which I dislike precisely because of its layout 
len ratingone The previous layout was awesome bring it back 
len ratingone EDIT I have also discovered that it no longer blocks ads that pop up and distrust your page 
len ratingone Ads that take over a page and won t let you go back but rather catch you in an endless loop when you try to go back 
len ratingone The old Chrome blocked those this safari imitation doesn t 
len ratingtwo I love Chrome on iOS but the new UI will push me away 
len ratingtwo The reason I use Chrome instead of Safari is because Chrome s UI is was 
len ratingtwo much better 
len ratingtwo The new UI makes Chrome basically Safari killing the sole reason I used it 
len ratingtwo It makes no sense to me
len ratingone This doesn t even look like chrome anymore 
len ratingone I have been using the chrome app since it was first released on iOS years ago specifically because it didn t have the same garbage look and feel as the safari app 
len ratingone When I opened chrome this morning I did a double take and thought that I had opened safari somehow but no chrome had just updated 
len ratingone I m super sad to see it be radically changed to be more like the app that most people are using it as an alternative to and uninstalled it from my phone this morning 
len ratingone It s the first time in years that I haven t had chrome on my phone and while it doesn t feel right to not have it the new app just isn t worth using to me 
len ratingone  The new layout and look is highly unappealing and frustrating to me 
len ratingone I ve used praised and encouraged other to use chrome ever since the release but now I m going to have to find another browser 
len ratingone Congrats 
len ratingone You look modern now 
len ratingone Unfortunately you failed when it comes to usability 
len ratingone Why are you making chrome like Safari 
len ratingone I hate the bar being on the bottom and that is the main reason why I would use Chrome instead of Safari 
len ratingone Now y all have moved the bar to the bottom too 
len ratingone Might as well use Safari Chrome is so similar to it now 
len ratingone Truly bummed about this update 
len ratingtwo Stop trying to look like apple if we wanted apple we wouldn t have downloaded your app in the first place 
len ratingtwo It looks like crap and is not as efficient as you probably think or hope it is 
len ratingthree  UI
len ratingtwo Why is it basically an exact replica 
len ratingtwo I liked how different they were 
len ratingtwo The bottom bar is a bit distracting 
len ratingthree The release of version seems to have broken how tabs work 
len ratingthree When I view all the tabs I can t get back to any of them 
len ratingthree Icons on the bottom to big for iPhone 
len ratingthree I hate the new update 
len ratingthree If I wanted to use Safari I would 
len ratingthree Please go back to the original look 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingone This new update is ridiculous 
len ratingone Now I have to re learn something that has been the same forever 
len ratingone Change it back
len ratingone New UI is super clunky tile tabs are weird and toolbar at the bottom makes zero sense 
len ratingone Might as well switch to Safari which I don t want to do 
len ratingone Why not let us revert to older versions if we want 
len ratingtwo It used to be good it now looked like a cheap version of safari
len ratingthree I hated the Safari browser ever since I got this phone 
len ratingthree Google is the main search engine 
len ratingthree Plus I hated the style of the Safari app 
len ratingthree After the update 
len ratingthree The look of the app and how everything is set up makes it not only more difficult to get used to but it also makes the app look uglier in my opinion 
len ratingthree Everything in the modern day is being rounded like corners and buttons within apps 
len ratingthree Does nobody remember how cool and retro squares and rectangles were 
len ratingthree It also made everything look more professional and organized 
len ratingthree I mostly hate the update for the aesthetics but I guess I can handle it 
len ratingfive The new interface update is fantastic 
len ratingone Anybody else hate this newest update or is it just me 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I would download that instead 
len ratingone Please give us our Google back 
len ratingone Grrrrrrrf
len ratingone Hate the new update look wish I could switch back to the old view 
len ratingone If I wanted it to look like safari I would just use safari 
len ratingone It s bad enough I m forced to use the inadequate Gmail 
len ratingone Now they ve f ed up their browser with a major change 
len ratingone I can t even sync my bookmarks anymore 
len ratingone I m ditching Chrome desktop and mobile browser for good 
len ratingone I ll use FF as it has no sync issues 
len ratingone The bored sheeple developers can t think logically anymore 
len ratingone They only think artistically but without practicality and users in mind but they re own circle at Google HQ 
len ratingone It was nice being able to turn on desktop mode and play audio from videos after closing the app 
len ratingone That was the main reason I used Chrome in addition to Safari 
len ratingone I guess that feature was disabled in this update 
len ratingfive I am giving this star because as an UI Designer I believe this update of chrome is fantastic for me so much important things are easy to reach people are complaining because of the look but to be honest in the long run I believe people will love this change and adapt it so to google please do not think you ve done a bad job give some days so that adaptability increases 
len ratingfive Although I didn t use that much but if stars is unchanged then assume that I am still satisfied 
len ratingfive I d never thought I d say it about any major visual update but this most recent won was Actually amazing and really helpful 
len ratingfive Wow 
len ratingfive Good job team 
len ratingone Why can t they ever add the simple things that ll make me actually want to use it over Safari like a bookmark bar 
len ratingone Also drop the whole mobile bookmark thing I just have bookmarks and folders for things I want to separate 
len ratingtwo I loved the old Chrome for IOS 
len ratingtwo It felt as if there was a unified experience across all platforms 
len ratingtwo With the new Chrome for iOS features seem buried it feels like extra clicks are required and features that don t seem extremely necessary a forward button 
len ratingtwo Desktop chrome removed this well over a decade ago Needless to say I Don t love the change hoping to see improvements 
len ratingthree Like please change this back to the way it was the saying if it ain t broke don t fix it exists for a reason and this really shows it
len ratingone  Chrome and Google will not log me in to my work account properly no matter how I try needs domain username 
len ratingone Safari and Edge log in flawlessly 
len ratingone Useless app to me 
len ratingtwo This new update completely demolished the old ui in exchange for one that s counterintuitive and confusing
len ratingone This latest update made me switch to Safari 
len ratingone The UI is awful and it s pretty much a copy of the Firefox app 
len ratingone Not good at all
len ratingone I m a highly adaptable person with technology and I strongly dislike the new layout 
len ratingone I appreciate the thumbnail view of all the open tabs but that s it 
len ratingone It s almost like chrome is trying to be more like safari which I don t care for 
len ratingone Did you steal safari developers 
len ratingone Lame 
len ratingfour I noticed that videos no longer continue nor are playable after closing the screen 
len ratingfour When I m listening to some music on YouTube and what to turn of the screen to save my battery life the music ends 
len ratingfour Clicking the play button on the lock screen just automatically plays music from Apple Music App 
len ratingfour Please bring back this function 
len ratingfour I miss having a song playing even after turning off the screen 
len ratingfour Those were the days I didn t have to use other apps to play music with the screen turned off 
len ratingthree Sorry but the latest update leaves something to be desired 
len ratingthree Been trying to get used to it in last few days and there s just something off about it 
len ratingthree It s lots more difficult to go back to a previous page in fact sometimes the back arrows are totally missing as well as other selections that used to be self evident 
len ratingthree And I don t like that black background 
len ratingthree Yuk 
len ratingthree Depressing 
len ratingthree Did you test this on anyone before you rolled it out 
len ratingthree And the auto save of passwords feature seems to have decided to not work 
len ratingthree I really liked that but now it doesn t even ask if I want Chrome to save or update for me or it does so intermittently 
len ratingthree Think you have some splaining to do or fix it please 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfive Finally a fresh look and I love it 
len ratingfour The latest version is missing the bookmark shortcut directly from the bottom toolbar 
len ratingfour This is a very frequently used function 
len ratingfour Instead you have to click on the three dots first which is a waste of time 
len ratingfive All that s left is CHROMECAST 
len ratingfive Let s get it for the IPHONE already
len ratingfive The revamped vers 
len ratingfive of iOS chrome is a godsend 
len ratingfive I got tired and annoyed by the previous layout which wasn t mobile friendly 
len ratingfive I switched to the Google app because it was mobile friendly but it still had its problems 
len ratingfive With the new update chrome is pretty much perfect 
len ratingfive Switched back P
len ratingone It was my favorite browser but then they ruined it by trying a new interface and you can t change it back on mobile now I have to find a new browser
len ratingone This app just a worse version of Safari and Safari is terrible 
len ratingone Forced update from the greatness that was the old chrome browser to an app that looks and feels worse than what comes standard on the IPhone 
len ratingone I ve been a loyal chrome user for as long as I can remember 
len ratingone This new forced UI is awful and clunky and unbearable 
len ratingone If you give us the option to switch back to the old UI I will happily give stars 
len ratingone This new UI makes me not even want to open my browser 
len ratingone The huge tabs are hideous and the bottom bar 
len ratingone If I wanted to use a crappy browser like safari it already comes installed on my iPhone 
len ratingone I m very displeased 
len ratingone I was a huge fan of Chrome because it was different better than Safari now they are basically the same thing 
len ratingthree  The tab system with the new update is rather clunky and difficult to navigate around rather than a file folder like layout it has a set of tiles in two columns each of which display in full needlessly closing the screen when you re looking for one tab amongst many 
len ratingthree I ve also experienced problems with webpages freezing if I got to the tabs screen and then crashing the app the tabs that freeze to not respond in any way not to attempts to close them renter them and they don t allow you to enter other tabs when this happens either only to scroll around the tabs screen or close all tabs 
len ratingthree In short this new system seems poorly thought out and poorly rolled out as well with many bugs and a less dense information display requiring more time and hassle to use I don t object to this tile display as an option for the less utilitarian user but as someone who values their time I don t require the addition of a feature whose only apparent purpose is to take up valuable screen space and increase loading and down times in the app 
len ratingfive I ve been waiting for this release 
len ratingfive I ve been a chrome fan since day one 
len ratingfive However on the ios platform it looked outdated 
len ratingfive Well today that has changed 
len ratingfive I ve moved the safari icon off my main menu and replaced it wth chrome 
len ratingfive This is app is fluid now just need the reader view 
len ratingfive But there s a work around 
len ratingfive Download shortcuts and then send to safari 
len ratingfive Good job Google 
len ratingtwo Everything feels more cramped in this version I prefer the toolbar to be on top instead of bottom 
len ratingtwo I don t have claustrophobia but the toolbar really makes me uncomfortable 
len ratingtwo I wish the toolbar and web address could hide from view instead of limiting how much viewing space I have 
len ratingtwo The bar at the bottom can really be distracting and annoying a lot and the new yo on the iPhone looks too much like safari I wish u guys would go back to the old design it was unique in its own way
len ratingone You people think you re improving things when in reality you continue to screw it up worse and worse and worse 
len ratingone That designers continue you act like they re mentally retarded 
len ratingtwo The reason that I liked Google Chrome is because it wasn t Safari 
len ratingtwo Now it IS Safari 
len ratingtwo The new update just looks like a cheap version of Safari 
len ratingtwo I may actually use Safari now 
len ratingtwo Please change back to the Chrome that we all loved 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari i would
len ratingone Not a fan of navigation bar being placed on bottom
len ratingtwo I dislike the new layout and design 
len ratingtwo It resembles Safari which I am not a fan of 
len ratingone Sorry Chrome this is a big disappointment
len ratingone  What happened to the old look 
len ratingone I want it back 
len ratingfive I wish this was my default browser instead of safari
len ratingfive I have been using chrome ever since I got my iPhone and mac and I like it way better than Safari 
len ratingfive In regards to the new UI I like the new overall feeling of it 
len ratingfive My only complaint is that I wish there was an option to move the toolbar back to the top 
len ratingfive I m sure I ll get used to the new layout but it s just muscle memory at this point to move my finger to the top right to add a new tab or the top left to go back 
len ratingfive Otherwise I haven t found anything I don t like 
len ratingone Part of my love for Chrome was that it was effectively the same format found on a PC as well as your phone 
len ratingone While the functionality is still there having a bottom tool bar is very distracting to me as a user 
len ratingone It s far too easy to unintentionally hit your back button takes up more space on the screen visually and as a whole looks less sleek and feels less intuitive than before 
len ratingone Kind of sad that the main reason I went with Chrome for mobile is going away for an option I think is very unappealing 
len ratingone Bad UI for anything that s not a big phone 
len ratingone Could you give option to have different UIs 
len ratingone Perhaps a smaller phone version 
len ratingone Everything else is great but please bring back old looks 
len ratingtwo I m trying to be open to the design change but that s my first issue with the new update 
len ratingtwo The main issue I have is that I ve noticed if I open several tabs from the articles for you portion none of them load in the background 
len ratingtwo I have to manually refresh them 
len ratingtwo If this continues I ll probably find a new browser 
len ratingthree I love using chrome 
len ratingthree However with the new version it s not for me 
len ratingthree I don t like having the task bar on the bottom 
len ratingthree Makes it feel like safari 
len ratingthree Might have to check out something else until it can give me an option to have task bar at the top again or until we can revert back to last version 
len ratingtwo  i 
len ratingtwo  GIFS are play buttons instead of images you click on to view 
len ratingtwo And they don t open up or enlarge even if you wanted to load the image 
len ratingtwo It s terrible please change this back
len ratingone It works just fine it s just I seriously don t like the new UI for Chrome now 
len ratingone I liked how it was before and I sadly cannot revert back to an older version to get it back 
len ratingone I might uninstall and use Safari instead if there s no option to change back 
len ratingone I will not be updating if they moved all controls to the bottom 
len ratingone It s the reason why I won t use safari 
len ratingthree  How do I attach a screenshot 
len ratingthree Opened by local bus transit web app to locate my next bus 
len ratingthree New Chrome has problem loading the Map overlay loads a weird development only map with low detail difficult to read
len ratingone here it is the new design is absolute garbage 
len ratingone change it back 
len ratingthree I ve been using Chrome as my primary browser for years 
len ratingthree One of the things I liked best was having the toolbar on the top 
len ratingthree Now that Chrome has switched to a bottom toolbar I m constantly looking for the top toolbar out of habit 
len ratingthree On the plus side I like the new tiled tab select window 
len ratingthree But the bottom toolbar is a huge detractor for me 
len ratingone I like it 
len ratingone BUT why don t you they have a reader view 
len ratingone Where I can tap a button and strips an article or webpage of all its media and ads and leaves behind just the article itself nothing else 
len ratingone Another helpful thing that your competitors do is have a narration button 
len ratingone For those with learning disabilities like myself it s very helpful 
len ratingone It just doesn t feel right 
len ratingone I switched away from safari for a reason but now what they re basically the same browser now
len ratingtwo Not very well optimized for the iPhone a little clunky and a little sluggish 
len ratingtwo It also does a bad job of running in the background so it rarely stays open on the page you were looking at 
len ratingtwo It also lacks a readers view option to mitigate websites that run crappily on the iOS so it renders certain sites impossible to view 
len ratingtwo Stick with Safari over this 
len ratingtwo I don t love it but it s better 
len ratingone Really disappointed by the newest update that switched the whole look of the browser and moved the control bar to the bottom 
len ratingone It s too similar to Safari and further removed from what operating Chrome on a desktop is like 
len ratingone I used the Chrome app because it was preferable to Safari for me 
len ratingone But now after the newest update there really is no reason for me to use Chrome over Safari 
len ratingone Boo 
len ratingfour The Setting button hidden when no open tabs there 
len ratingone  If your UI is going to look and function exactly like your competitors what motivation do your users have to choose you instead of their native software 
len ratingone If I wanted to use a Web browser that looked and functioned like Safari I d just use Safari 
len ratingone I don t know why having the toolbar on the bottom of the screen would be more convenient but it very much is not 
len ratingone The update is ugly and turns Chrome into a Safari clone 
len ratingone I have absolutely no desire to use Chrome anymore 
len ratingone Stupid bug where it goes to the screen showing all the windows then freezes
len ratingfour This review is for the newly redesigned app 
len ratingfour For years although I vastly preferred Chrome over Safari or Firefox for iPad each update brought no really good useful improvements AFAIC 
len ratingfour Same lackluster buggy performance and so many features you needed the PC version to use 
len ratingfour The new version solves all of that for me it operates like a full PC or MAC version at last 
len ratingfour And it s intuitive I ve only had to use Help once 
len ratingthree I love chrome but moving the bar to the bottom of the page is annoying 
len ratingthree I prefer it at the top 
len ratingthree At least an option to be able to move it back 
len ratingthree It changes the functionality for me
len ratingfive For a long time I ve been waiting for Chrome to do something about how difficult it is to use when all of the functions are at the top of the screen 
len ratingfive Bottom screen navigation from a good user experience standpoint is the way to go 
len ratingfive Will definitely be using over safari full time now 
len ratingfive The overhaul of the Chrome iOS UI greatly improves its usability and accessibility 
len ratingfive Looks great too 
len ratingtwo I m having so much trouble with the new update 
len ratingtwo I was trying to upload my resume on a website a couple of times already 
len ratingtwo It tends to take to me a tab page 
len ratingtwo Where I m not allowed to go back on it afterwards 
len ratingtwo I thought whatever I ll try exiting and trying and again 
len ratingtwo It s the same thing I never had an issue with chrome until now 
len ratingtwo Fix this
len ratingone If I had known how awful the update would ve been I wouldn t have done it 
len ratingone Like other reviewers have mentioned things are backwards and too much of Safari feel to it 
len ratingone Ugh 
len ratingone I hope Google realizes how big a fail this update is and goes back to the redesign board ASAP 
len ratingone I used to use chrome because I thought it was better than Safari but now it s just an awful copy of it 
len ratingone Please put it back the way it used to be 
len ratingone I don t like it at all 
len ratingone makes me feel like my husband is monitoring my browser for some reason don t like it would like the regular one please 
len ratingone Thank you
len ratingtwo I used to love chrome because of the comfortable UI and the way everything syncs on desktop and mobile platforms 
len ratingtwo Then came the latest update and bam 
len ratingtwo I m back to Safari 
len ratingtwo I didn t have any hatred for Safari I just loved Chrome too much 
len ratingtwo But now Chrome has become a bad knockoff of Safari 
len ratingtwo I think I d move to Edge by Microsoft because it feels better on desktop now even the desktop update of Chrome looks immature and uses way too much ram and can sync between devices 
len ratingone Constantly crashes pages don t load properly 
len ratingone Sad as it may sound I actually prefer to work with Safari 
len ratingone Never thought I ll see the day 
len ratingone The new GUI is atrocious and unintuitive 
len ratingone Please liken it more to previos iterations 
len ratingone It actually became unusable to me which is a real shame because I hate Safari 
len ratingthree I like chrome for the computer syncing with tabs and how it used to look 
len ratingthree I much preferred it to Safari but now the whole look is clunky 
len ratingthree Everything is bold and larger than it was 
len ratingthree I don t mind the layout so much as just the overall look 
len ratingthree I will have to use it a bit more to get used to it but as of right now I m seriously considering at looking back at safari 
len ratingone I had this app download because the UI was always simpler and more efficient now it s like it has taken a couple steps back to 
len ratingone Not a fan 
len ratingone Terrible update 
len ratingone Change it back to how it was before the update 
len ratingone Why why is it that as soon as you get used to the way something works developers think gee I bet everyone would love if I changed it on them NOBODY WANTS TO LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE NEW LAYOUTS 
len ratingone The least you could do before you shove your new stuff down our throat is give the option to which layout we like 
len ratingfive  A lot of users are complaining about the UI design change 
len ratingfive That s normal to not like change 
len ratingfive I switched from Dolphin browser to Chrome since Dolphin stopped working with iOS and I m very impressed with Chrome 
len ratingfive It s x faster than Dolphin 
len ratingfive It has all the great features of Dolphin and it s fairly easy to use 
len ratingfive Best of all I have all my data synced from my desktop browser 
len ratingfive Nice work team 
len ratingone With recent updates today is the app is absolutely useless because of constant bugs which are making it hard for me to get my work done 
len ratingone The old app didn t look quite as sleek but I had never had an issue with it 
len ratingone Now I haven t to use safari which doesn t have any of the features but at least I can upload download and save as needed 
len ratingone The glitches are really bugging me and I would really appreciate it getting fixed soon since the old app was perfect 
len ratingone Once it is fixed I ll update my review but until then I recommend safari over chrome 
len ratingtwo This new layout is garbage 
len ratingtwo If I wanted this I would ve never downloaded chrome and just used safari instead 
len ratingfive It took a little while to get used to it but the new UI is brilliant 
len ratingfive It s much easier to use having everything accessible from the bottom of the screen and runs like a dream 
len ratingfive I only wish they hadn t made an arbitrary change with incognito mode moving those tabs to the left side of the tab switcher opposite of their previous right side location 
len ratingone I got Chrome because Safari s layout is unintuitive for thumbs they shouldn t have to bend that way guys 
len ratingone Now Safari is better because at least in that app I can refresh with one click 
len ratingone Awful UI update 
len ratingone Your update is horrible 
len ratingone You ruined a perfectly working version just to make it look more attractive 
len ratingone Go back to the drawing board because this isn t worth the obvious minimal amount of work you put into it 
len ratingone What used to take me seconds to search load a site now takes over a minute and that s when it works 
len ratingone I m disappointed in you Google 
len ratingone  I don t like the most updated version 
len ratingone It reminds me to much of Safari and I hate that search engine the layout just feels weird 
len ratingone I loved the out layout for Google Chrome now not so much
len ratingfour Honestly close out the app because I thought I had opened safari by mistake with the new update 
len ratingfour I like the new feel of the design feels familiar to me still 
len ratingfive  You are my favorite internet engine 
len ratingfive With Apples new update Apple removed you from my screen so now I have to go to their App Store and search their to open Chrome Google 
len ratingfive They left Safari which I never use 
len ratingfive Safari must belong to Apple 
len ratingfive Safari should be removed from screen also then 
len ratingone The newest version confuses me 
len ratingone I thought that links from gmail were going to Safari 
len ratingone I hate the Safari mobile browser 
len ratingone Please go back to the old design 
len ratingone The bottom bar is terrible 
len ratingone The functionality is clunkier 
len ratingone It looks like Safari 
len ratingthree If I wanted to run a Safari browser I d open Safari 
len ratingthree Give me back the Chrome I liked so well 
len ratingthree Messed up on this update 
len ratingthree Love the new button locations 
len ratingthree Makes it easier for one handed use 
len ratingthree The latest update with Apple TV update and AirPlay through Chrome does not work 
len ratingthree The new update makes chrome too similar to safari 
len ratingthree I downloaded chrome on my iPhone for the reason that it is different from safari 
len ratingthree I m disappointed they are very similar now 
len ratingone I hate the new update 
len ratingone If I wanted this layout I would use Safari 
len ratingone Bring back the old one ASAP 
len ratingthree The most recent update has me annoyed 
len ratingthree They moved the page navigation to the bottom which is so inconvenient 
len ratingthree Might as well be safari at this point 
len ratingtwo All the buttons are soft and kiddy now 
len ratingtwo I liked that they were on the top and not in the way of everything 
len ratingtwo This is why I got chrome in the first place because I don t like the way safari is set up 
len ratingtwo But now chrome is just the plushie version of safari 
len ratingtwo It s not cute 
len ratingtwo Put it back 
len ratingtwo Also when I play videos on chrome they glitch out and replay ads or jump back a minute randomly 
len ratingone What the actual hell Google 
len ratingone For a tech company you really have missed the mark or making your app for the technically inclined 
len ratingone What is that new UI 
len ratingone Is this some social experiment 
len ratingone What idiot approved this bubbly ridiculous looking change 
len ratingone Things used to be intuitive and had a certain order those are long gone and have been replaced with something that appears to be geared towards those in their twilight years 
len ratingone I ll be switching over to Safari for awhile as it now more closely resembles Chrome at this time well at least in layout 
len ratingone How do I get the old version back
len ratingfive The increased size for the new tab button ease of acess for incognito tabs and a super convinient clear history button located right next to the new tab button make this app even better than it was before 
len ratingfive Saves me even more time when I need to do a quick search 
len ratingthree New update is not going well 
len ratingthree Continues to freeze as I scroll 
len ratingthree It s the same as Safari now 
len ratingthree Literally no difference 
len ratingthree Please revert back 
len ratingfive I have used this app for a while 
len ratingfive And it s always getting better even if the updates are useless 
len ratingfive I think we can all agree on that 
len ratingthree  I like chrome but I would update if the navigation bar was up instead of it being down why 
len ratingtwo This new update is awful has too much of a mobile safari browser feeling to it 
len ratingtwo Please change this awful format 
len ratingone I had tabs opened on my iPad 
len ratingone After updating the tabs were destroyed as well as their history 
len ratingone Thanks Google good job texting your software thoroughly before releasing it
len ratingone The UI redesign is a step backwards 
len ratingone Actions on bottom and top bars waste space and are less conducive for one handed browsing 
len ratingone It feels like a Safari clone now 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingfour After updating to ios and with new chrome update 
len ratingfour When i type in google i am unable to select any option from suggestions 
len ratingtwo Seriously 
len ratingtwo The recent update changed the entire UI it is hardly recognizable as the Chrome 
len ratingtwo Now it feels like another Safari 
len ratingtwo I use Chrome on devices with different OS Windows Android and IOS because Chrome is good in seem less synchronizing now the IOS app has completely different UI layout 
len ratingtwo Makes no sense 
len ratingthree The browser works the same however the new update and layout isn t for everyone I would prefer the layout from the previous version and I cannot find options in the browser settings to change it 
len ratingone The redesign was a bold move but the new interface is confusing and over complicated 
len ratingone I often look at maps using Chrome on my iPhone 
len ratingone Now when I am scrolling up through an image Chrome thinks I want to refresh the page or add a new tab so my map ends up refreshing five times before I can get to the information I need 
len ratingone This redesign is basically a direct copy of Safari and it s awful 
len ratingone Now Chrome is just a direct copy of all of the other phone browsers except less stable 
len ratingone Sigh 
len ratingfive Tickle man naked
len ratingthree Some of the features of the new update are alright but it feels awkward to have the menu forward back etc at the bottom of the screen 
len ratingthree When on a PC everything is at the top so it feels more natural having the and buttons and tabs next to the website search bar 
len ratingthree I like the new tabs interface but overall I prefer everything more like it is on PC which is why I used chrome on iPhone in the first place 
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingone Thought it was fine before 
len ratingone It s trying to imitate safari 
len ratingone Bring back the classic style as an alternative option 
len ratingone The new design looks way to cheap 
len ratingone Seems more like a childrens toy than a professional browser 
len ratingone Don t fix what s not broken
len ratingone This update is bad revert it back
len ratingtwo I ve used Chrome as my default browser on iOS for many years but this update is awful 
len ratingtwo The new UI like many others have commented is a step backwards 
len ratingtwo Many of the things that kept me in Chrome now look like Safari why 
len ratingtwo What s up with the incompete URL bar that leaves you guessing what page you re on 
len ratingtwo Why the rounded corners 
len ratingtwo Why the buttons at the bottom 
len ratingtwo Why the new way of closing tabs 
len ratingtwo Why the childish design 
len ratingtwo Give us our great browser back please 
len ratingone Update makes this app basically safari 
len ratingone I hate safari and now with the update chrome looks like safari and acts like it bring back my old chrome 
len ratingone They refreshed the UI and went back years in design 
len ratingone The previous design was clean and intuitive now it s basically a safari clone 
len ratingone Now chrome is just like safari I hate the bottom tool bar 
len ratingone Put it back on top 
len ratingfive  Love the update 
len ratingone I ve never provided ANY type of app mobile feedback until today 
len ratingone I thought something was wrong with my browser as I couldn t find the back new browser close buttons 
len ratingone Come to find out it s because of the latest Chrome update 
len ratingone UGH 
len ratingone Until I see or hear that Google provides an opt out button to revert UI back to previous version interface I ll be uninstalling after writing this review and using Firefox and NO to Safari which I ve avoided like the plague 
len ratingtwo Been using chrome as long as I can remember 
len ratingtwo This new update definitely ruined it though 
len ratingtwo Won t let me go on certain pages I ve been going to for years 
len ratingtwo It s garbage
len ratingone The new version looks like someone filed the serial numbers off Safari
len ratingfive I always use chrome because everything is linked but I am in LOVE with the latest update 
len ratingfive It looks better runs faster and is generally more convenient 
len ratingfive  A like chrome I never had any problems browsing app on my iPhone plus a lot more incognito browsing and a lot more helpful things
len ratingone I loved using chrome 
len ratingone Now it s just a knock off of the way safari is layed out 
len ratingone Dumb 
len ratingone Should have kept it the way it was 
len ratingone the only reason i use google chrome is because safari is a trashy browser and now chrome looks exactly like safary like why 
len ratingone please go back to the old design 
len ratingone  Google 
len ratingone I d love to know the decision making process behind making Chrome on iOS look like a cheap no name knockoff of Safari that one might see on some no name tablet that comes pre installed that you never use 
len ratingone I enjoyed Chrome for the similar experience across all my devices 
len ratingone Windows iOS etc 
len ratingone That are one of the top major selling points 
len ratingone You effectively obliterated that one 
len ratingone Look if you guys want to revert it back with out telling anyone I will not be mad not will I say anything 
len ratingone Secret is safe with me 
len ratingone If I wanted my browser to look like Safari I d use Safari 
len ratingone I hate the page forward backward arrows search and open pages being at the bottom 
len ratingone Please put them back up top 
len ratingone This is the worst update ever 
len ratingone  There s no cancel refresh button for a browser 
len ratingone Every browser does 
len ratingone The touch experience is not fine tuned and it s just poor 
len ratingone Most importantly network WiFi is always spinning meaning it s constantly transfer stuff when while just reading a page Unbelievable 
len ratingone But now it is just like Safari 
len ratingone I migrated to Apple but have always hated safari 
len ratingone Chrome gave me what I wanted 
len ratingone Now it is no different 
len ratingone Will be looking for a new browser 
len ratingtwo Good job Google after years and years of using Safari the latest Chrome update made me replace the native iOS browser 
len ratingtwo For a day 
len ratingtwo Sadly you can not block ads on Chrome which simply makes this a big no no to use for every day browsing 
len ratingtwo Wake up Google or Apple or whatever monsters you have become 
len ratingone Why did you change the layout 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I would use safari
len ratingone Google has known for years based on their own user forums about pop ups that hijack the browser and has thus far refused to do anything about them 
len ratingone They will come up on any website and completely shut down the browser 
len ratingone The only way to fix them is to uninstall and reinstall the app 
len ratingone My Google chrome updated and I m stuck in incognito modenn on my iPhone 
len ratingone It no longer gives me the option to choose regular browse or incognito 
len ratingone the only option is incognito on my phone and gives both options on my computer Hi Some recent design updates have changed how to open Incognito tabs on Chrome iOS 
len ratingone A To open a new tab Tap More 
len ratingone  To open an Incognito Tab select New Incognito Tab 
len ratingone  To open a regular Chrome Tab select New Tab 
len ratingone B To switch between In
len ratingone I do not like your latest update 
len ratingone I don t like the little boxes in the bowser 
len ratingone Navigation is too detailed and hard to navigate 
len ratingone It s busy 
len ratingfive I work on web application like eprocure gov bd 
len ratingfive Now for emergency cases I using Sleipnir browser 
len ratingfive Please I request to google chrome team to add User Agent features to chrome with user agent are 
len ratingfive Firefox x 
len ratingfive Firefox x 
len ratingfive Firefox x Thank you in advance 
len ratingone The new tab menu is awful 
len ratingone In a world of quick gesture based interfaces why would you revert to hunting and pecking for a tiny X to close a tab 
len ratingone Also the new tab boxes are smaller and show less information than the mini page preview in previous versions 
len ratingone Identifying managing and browsing multiple tabs is now less efficient and slower overall 
len ratingone This is a step backwards 
len ratingone Looks like safari now 
len ratingone Why even have chrome 
len ratingone I like how the tabs are organized but that s it 
len ratingone Give me the old UI that didn t take up screen space while browsing 
len ratingone My app just got updated and I m already disliking the layout 
len ratingone Looks too similar to Safari and I don t like that one either 
len ratingone My go to browser has always been Chrome but not now 
len ratingone Short and sweet 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would use Safari 
len ratingone Why does Chrome wants to look like Safari 
len ratingfive I ve been waiting for the back button to be moved to the bottom of the screen forever now 
len ratingfive It has finally been done and I m so ecstatic 
len ratingfive Also the new design looks amazing too 
len ratingfive Haven t seen the card layout in awhile but I m liking it and glad that you gave the option to close all I ll never use it though 
len ratingfive It s a bit weird though that you can t close by sliding since I ve become so used to that 
len ratingfive Also putting a search button at the bottom was genius 
len ratingfive Thanks for the great update 
len ratingfive it s a good app what do you expect definitely would rather use this that the actual google app not sure why that one exists tbh 
len ratingtwo  Update at bottom 
len ratingtwo Still negative 
len ratingtwo New UI Very safari like in layout 
len ratingtwo Runs counter to what I m accustomed to when using various versions of Chrome 
len ratingtwo Using the prior version was very intuitive if coming from a desktop version of Chrome or even Firefox 
len ratingtwo This one isn t 
len ratingtwo The new tab picker is now worse than Safari s 
len ratingtwo I don t want to scroll through a photo album layout of all my tabs 
len ratingtwo The pictures are small enough to be useless if the shown page is largely text based like Wikipedia 
len ratingtwo Barely any of the page title can be shown now because the tiles are small 
len ratingtwo At least Safari shows enough of the title and a bit of the page in a large enough image to clearly tell what you re looking at 
len ratingtwo The prior chrome tab picker was wonderful in how it displayed the cards in a manner very easily scrolled through 
len ratingtwo I needed only scroll and and move my eyes slightly up or down to find then read the title of each tab 
len ratingtwo With this new version you have to look up and down and left and right to track and find each tab title then read the tiny bit of title available 
len ratingtwo I will concede the the new UI might be mildly prettier 
len ratingtwo However the clean compact easily functional design of the previous UI made it beautiful 
len ratingtwo Update Been a few days since I started seeing the new UI 
len ratingtwo The prior UI felt professional 
len ratingtwo This one feels childish 
len ratingtwo Figured if I m going to have to learn a new UI then I might as well see what other browsers have to offer 
len ratingtwo  Aloha has the same tab picker as Safari but a few cool features 
len ratingtwo  Brave has the same tab picker as the new chrome but a few cool features 
len ratingtwo  Firefox has the same tab picker as the new chrome but with a tab search function 
len ratingtwo It also feels a bit more professional in its style and with a menu large enough to show everything 
len ratingtwo  Safari at least feels more professional 
len ratingtwo  Cake is the most interesting 
len ratingtwo If I can get used to it possibly the best alternative I see 
len ratingtwo Side scrolling tab picker 
len ratingtwo Bunch of fancy search features if you want to use them 
len ratingtwo A fairly professional feel to it 
len ratingtwo It s replaced chrome on my dock 
len ratingtwo We ll see if it stays but yeah 
len ratingthree Why use if everything functions like Safari 
len ratingone Was awesome to use and easy to navigate until the most recent update 
len ratingone They flipped the toolbar to the bottom and it s now no easier to navigate than Safari which came on the phone 
len ratingone Will no longer be using Chrome
len ratingone Looks like a cheap version of safari unfortunately 
len ratingone The whole appeal of using this app was that it felt like a mobile version of what you get on chrome desktop 
len ratingone As it should be but now it doesn t feel related at all 
len ratingone Wish I didn t update 
len ratingthree Please add confirmation for the close all tabs button 
len ratingthree I know I shouldn t have tabs open but I also feel like the Close All Tabs button is entirely too close to the New Incognito Tab button 
len ratingthree Edit I m an idiot and did it again 
len ratingthree Yes it s my fault 
len ratingthree Removing another star nonetheless 
len ratingthree Edit Thanks for fixing that one issue 
len ratingthree However not adding any stars back because everything else about this update is awful 
len ratingone New layout is almost like Safari 
len ratingone Booooo
len ratingone You changed everything around 
len ratingone I can t even upload my resume to job sites from my phone like I used to because I get this message saying your browser cannot connect to Dropbox or my phone or a server 
len ratingone I m on a business internet connection 
len ratingone Seriously fire whoever destroyed this once decent browser and hire me 
len ratingone I absolutely despise the new interface 
len ratingone The old one was better
len ratingone New user interface is less enjoyable by a large amount 
len ratingfive The new look is awesome and more functional love it 
len ratingone Can t stand new update to my iOS chrome app also my autoupdate is turned off just for these reasons so I can wait and see if the updates have bugs yet somehow you bypassed my settings and updated anyways After using the new chrome I was able to get my laptop back to the old chrome and can t get my iOS devices back wish I could 
len ratingone It is not more efficient it is not more convenient it is not more user friendly it is the opposite fire your yr olds on your development team and work on efficiency and convenience not changing the look feel to a cartoon 
len ratingone I have been using chrome for years 
len ratingone It s usually the first thing I download on a new iPhone 
len ratingone However the latest update has made it just like safari 
len ratingone If I wanted safari I would have never downloaded this to begin with 
len ratingone I ll be deleting chrome and searching for a new browser now 
len ratingone The last update made this look like every other browser I don t use
len ratingtwo The new redesign is awful 
len ratingtwo The functionality reminds me of safari which I always hated which is why I used chrome 
len ratingtwo Now you ve gone and made it just like a crappy app that I hate 
len ratingtwo WHAT GIVES 
len ratingtwo Every time I open it I think I ve opened the wrong app by mistake 
len ratingtwo Hate hate HATE 
len ratingtwo Just got the new version of chrome 
len ratingtwo I don t love the layout 
len ratingtwo It s much harder to navigate between tabs 
len ratingtwo Now the browser crashes every or th page 
len ratingtwo It feels too much like Safari 
len ratingtwo If I wanted Safari I wouldn t be using chrome 
len ratingone  If I wanted to use safari I d use safari 
len ratingone Absolutely hate the new update 
len ratingone I like the new layout it s fine 
len ratingone But PLEASE fix the browser because Chrome didn t shut down correctly is bothersome and I can t save my tabs
len ratingtwo Was good until the most recent update
len ratingtwo I ve used the Chrome app as my main browser for a while now 
len ratingtwo The old UI certainly had it s annoyances but it was superior to the other browser options overall 
len ratingtwo This new UI seems to emulate the Safari browser the iOS aesthetic which is a certifiably bad choice 
len ratingtwo Everything now has a rounded off bubbly look that makes one feel like they re using a child s toy 
len ratingtwo In addition they seem to have removed the swipe to close tabs option in favor of a small X 
len ratingtwo This is a major quality of life downgrade 
len ratingtwo The buttons have migrated to the bottom of the screen which is annoying visually but a probable time saver 
len ratingtwo Overall the awesome functionality I love is still there but it s hindered by the awful new UI 
len ratingone I prefer the old tabs system 
len ratingtwo  Chrome seems to be making it harder to clear cookies data 
len ratingtwo If I clear browsing data in a tab I had open I remain logged in everywhere 
len ratingtwo If I close my current tab and open a new tab in order to clear browsing data it appears to log me out and clear cookies most of the time but not always 
len ratingtwo This is with sync off for history tabs etc 
len ratingtwo Also saved search settings for do not save recent locations and do not auto play do not save despite me being logged on to my account 
len ratingtwo Those settings reset to Google defaults each time ie save recent locations becomes selected again 
len ratingtwo Clicking on clear locations either does nothing or takes me to a blank page 
len ratingone Google chrome was so much better before the update so much easier to use as well 
len ratingone If I wanted to use the bottom of my phone to access tabs and search for things I would use Safari 
len ratingone I d give stars if they bring back the old layout and look 
len ratingone I gave it a chance 
len ratingone The new interface is terrible 
len ratingone I strongly dislike the bar on the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone Wish I could revert back to the previous version 
len ratingthree  The new layout is great in that it adds a lot of functionality by making functions easier to reach 
len ratingthree However functions on the bottom task bar can be a little tricky on the iPhone X particularly swiping to change tabs this can very easily result in an inadvertent swipe to change apps 
len ratingthree Furthermore Chrome s helpful swipe down to create a new tab refresh or close tabs hardly seems to activate post update particularly on pages that are large enough to have scrolling which is nearly every website 
len ratingthree This looks like Safari 
len ratingthree I hate Safari 
len ratingthree The swipe to close tab option is gone which is something I liked about Chrome 
len ratingthree I feel like I have to do a tutorial just so I can figure out how to use an app that I ve been using for years 
len ratingthree Please please please consider changing the look back 
len ratingone The reason I used Google Chrome was because it was so much different than Safari and it bucked the industry norm of being laid out like a desktop browser but on a phone 
len ratingone I used it because Safari just wasn t as intuitive as Google Chrome 
len ratingone But it is literally a direct ripoff of Safari layout and all 
len ratingone Google you are alienating your user base 
len ratingone Don t design your app just like Safari 
len ratingone You have run away this year user 
len ratingone Uninstalling 
len ratingone The reason I loved the old layout was because it gave a harmonious desktop experience on my Chromebook and phone 
len ratingone You ve changed the layout but made it worse and different than the desktop experience 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingone  Considering getting rid of my Chromebook now
len ratingfive I am fond of new browser design 
len ratingfive All of buttons are in reach 
len ratingfive Previouse Design was a headache specially when you want to search in big screen phone 
len ratingtwo I ve been a loyal long time user so it pains me to say that I ve swapped browsers after only days with this improved version of Chrome 
len ratingtwo Don t plan on using this iteration for single handed browsing as tab management is now small cards that require a particularly specific degree of precision to tap the x to close them you don t appear to have the option to sweep them off the screen as you used to 
len ratingtwo I can t imagine how hard this is to use if you have a larger phone screen as well 
len ratingtwo If you re going to force someone to tap an X to close a tab maybe align them from the bottom up 
len ratingtwo Additionally the function button that used to be in the upper right for settings new tab etc is now right where the prior button to open up the window manager was that s been shifted closer to the center right next to a rather unnecessary and overly large search button which I thought was what the Omni box is for just type and go 
len ratingtwo Seems redundant 
len ratingtwo And changing between linked Chrome sessions desktop laptop etc and incognito windows if you use them is now inconveniently placed at the top of the screen with rather small and again single handed operator unfriendly areas to select for each type of session 
len ratingtwo I wouldn t complain about this but there is simply blank space to each side of this that serves no apparent function anyways and is thus wasted screen real estate at the expense of usability 
len ratingtwo Still fast still renders most pages with ease just pretty much unusable unless you can devote all your attention to it 
len ratingtwo While a design refresh is certainly appreciated it shouldn t be at the expense of what was your top notch usability 
len ratingtwo Hope I have the opportunity to come back to chrome in the future 
len ratingtwo The entire point of downloading chrome was because I didn t like safari 
len ratingtwo Now it looks and feels just like it 
len ratingtwo The new way to view all of your tabs is awful it s super annoying trying to close out of one or two tabs with one hand 
len ratingtwo I looks like they did this so they could get people from safari to switch over because it functions almost exactly the same now 
len ratingtwo If there was an option to use the old layout that would be amazing 
len ratingtwo As of right now there is no reason to switch from safari to chrome so don t bother 
len ratingone Wow would you look at that 
len ratingone The two main reasons I use chrome the tab layout and the button position are now nearly identical to safari 
len ratingone Good job 
len ratingthree  the new version looks like safari 
len ratingthree is it possible to use the old version or roll back the update 
len ratingthree the grid for the tabs makes getting rid of old tabs all at once difficult and also gets rid of your previous ability to preview the tab before you open it 
len ratingthree also the bar on top showing the URL the person is using is both distracting and useless 
len ratingthree moving all functions to a previously nonexistent bottom bar is jarring for users and makes it look less like a browser and more like an app 
len ratingone Yo I thought I opened up Firefox but no it s just a chrome redesign 
len ratingthree I love google products 
len ratingthree Every product is unique and great UI 
len ratingthree The recent design changes on chrome is terrible 
len ratingthree The old design was much better 
len ratingthree I wish they make better material design for the chrome on iOS 
len ratingthree Chrome s fine I mostly use it to avoid safari on my iPhone but the new version puts the tabs and bars at the bottom so if you re someone that does things on muscle memory you re going to have a bad time 
len ratingthree Please give us the option to put the utility bar where we want instead of changing it on an update 
len ratingtwo  Would rate one star on this update if there wasn t a hidden setting in flags to disable the new ui refresh that has been forced on users 
len ratingtwo Will happily rate five stars if users are given an option of using the original ui in an easily findable setting 
len ratingtwo Can we have a way to use the one design you put all the buttons in hard to reach places
len ratingone The whole interface has been completely changed on me and feels very similar to Safari 
len ratingone I downloaded Chrome to GET AWAY from the non intuitive Safari feel 
len ratingone The open a new tab window button was moved to the bottom which they claim makes it more accessible but at least for me it isn t 
len ratingone They changed the whole way swiping away tabs worked which was always one of the key features I used 
len ratingone The new design also does not look like google with everything having rounded edges it feel more like an apple browser now 
len ratingfive Love the added su
len ratingtwo While some of the features of the latest update are appealing when I first opened the app I thought I was in Safari 
len ratingtwo I hate the look of safari which is why I ONLY use google chrome across my devices 
len ratingtwo PLEASE make it look less like safari 
len ratingone I used chrome because I hated safari s interface 
len ratingone Now they re the same 
len ratingone me the new design thanks i hate it i thought i had safari open for a moment and the whole reason i got chrome on ios is because i don t like how safari looks 
len ratingone I never write reviews but ever since my iPhone updated Chrome I want to peel my skin off 
len ratingone That might seem like I m over exaggerating but I use my phone s browser a lot 
len ratingone Chrome has always been my favorite browser 
len ratingone Google why fix something that was never broken 
len ratingone The new layout is horrible and extremely annoying 
len ratingone Please consider giving us an option to use the old style 
len ratingone Until then time to look for a new browser 
len ratingone I only downloaded Chrome because I didnt like the look and feel of Safari browser 
len ratingone But now you ve made it the same almost so why should I keep this 
len ratingone Not at all like chrome on web anymore 
len ratingone Just ugly 
len ratingtwo Just add extensions for mobile
len ratingfive I love the new update 
len ratingfive It s more organized 
len ratingfive Easier to navigate 
len ratingfive It has a clean and simple look to it 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone New UI is terrible 
len ratingone Hate that they moved the navigation buttons to the bottom of the window 
len ratingone Having them at the top was precisely why I chose Chrome over Safari 
len ratingone Peace out Google 
len ratingone I was using google chrome because I don t like how safari is laid out 
len ratingone Now chrome is laid out the same as safari 
len ratingone And honestly the curvy edges of everything just look terrible in my opinion 
len ratingone Disappointed 
len ratingone The new update tries it s hardest to be Safari and that s not a good thing 
len ratingone Chrome had issues before the update but it felt smooth to use on mobile and tabs were easily managed 
len ratingone Poor form Google 
len ratingone I used to love this app it had a convenient simple design and I could easily navigate the internet 
len ratingone After the new update I can t say any of these things about Chrome 
len ratingone I understand it s an app things will change every now and then 
len ratingone But this is a major change that can risk a lot of your users 
len ratingone The design itself is clunky and strange 
len ratingone There is no more swipe to remove a tab 
len ratingone The toolbar at the bottom that auto hides which I personally hate is ugly takes up space and is a downgrade from the user friendly previous version of Chrome I loved 
len ratingone Not to mention it looks like a carbon copy of Safari 
len ratingone Like someone else said in a recent review If we had to go on the App Store and DOWNLOAD Chrome rather than use the pre downloaded Safari why would you think we liked the design of Safari 
len ratingone I think you should return to the old design or at least give us an option to go back with Settings 
len ratingone The majority of your users dislike the Safari design therefore you shouldn t try to make a copy of them 
len ratingone I will use Safari from now on until it is updated to look better because I might as well if your apps look almost exactly alike 
len ratingone Hate the safari looking new update 
len ratingone Hard to switch tabs 
len ratingone Google news renders horribly on iPhone 
len ratingone Half screen taken up by bars 
len ratingtwo new update removed everything i used chrome for replaced it with a somehow even worse safari design complete with the giant bars that animate too much and detract from the content and thick emphasized buttons 
len ratingtwo having a single menu button and a single toolbar made it so much easier to pay attention to the content 
len ratingtwo now the UI is too bubbly animated and stylized 
len ratingtwo who took over the UI team and have they taken an intro course in graphic design 
len ratingtwo also what made them think the people using the chrome app did it because they loved the safari design so much 
len ratingtwo  stars because it mechanically functions and has an incognito feature 
len ratingfour Excelente actualizaci n 
len ratingfour Me gusta la barra de navegaci n en el inferior Lo malo que siento que el navegador pierde todo su estilo y lo siento un tanto diferente pero ser cuesti n de adaptarse
len ratingone Update is terrible 
len ratingone Who in he world is designing these things an autonomous robot 
len ratingone Jejejeje
len ratingone It looks like safari 
len ratingone What s the point of having two Safaris 
len ratingone I guess I ll have to delete google chrome if they dont change it back 
len ratingfive Buy this NOW
len ratingone New UI is like Safari 
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingone Revert 
len ratingone  This update is awful 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would already be using it 
len ratingone Not an improvement in any way at all but a change for the sake of change 
len ratingone There needs to be a setting to show tabs the old way or a way to revert this whole mess 
len ratingone The light blue and white in the settings menu is also difficult to read and looks unprofessional 
len ratingone Please revert or improve this 
len ratingone I can t believe Google had the gall to even release this stinking pile of garbage 
len ratingone There s nothing good to be said about it 
len ratingtwo  Seriously 
len ratingtwo The recent update changed the entire UI it is hardly recognizable as the Chrome 
len ratingtwo Now it feels like another Safari 
len ratingtwo I use Chrome on devices with different OS Windows Android and IOS because Chrome is good in seem less synchronizing now the IOS app has completely UI layout 
len ratingtwo Makes no sense 
len ratingthree Don t like so far I think it looks kind of cheap is the best way I can describe it 
len ratingthree Maybe I m just an old geezer who doesn t like things he s accustomed to change for no apparent reason 
len ratingthree The previous iteration was already flawless to me and using it had become second nature 
len ratingthree I m curious as to how many downloads their best competitor has probably a single digit percentage not like they re falling behind do to lack of innovation or such 
len ratingthree Change for the sake of change 
len ratingfive Love it Its awesome 
len ratingthree I love the tabs look but I miss having the arrows and the tab button and the dots for options at the top 
len ratingthree Put the bar at the top with the new tab look and the new way the menu appears in the dots and it d be perfect 
len ratingone This update is really for the worst 
len ratingone I don t know if they were trying to make things easier to access by jamming a bunch of stuff into a second toolbar but I hate everything about it 
len ratingone It takes up a lot of visual real estate before you start scrolling 
len ratingone The colors size placement feel more kid friendly and not built for your average user 
len ratingone Would trade it back in a heartbeat if I could 
len ratingthree The new update changes the old format which made it superior to safari but now it looks like a knockoff safari 
len ratingthree Not to mention the pointless search key which has always been there 
len ratingone This is embarrassing 
len ratingone The GUI is really bad guys 
len ratingone Constructive feedback for the team at google 
len ratingone I have no idea how to close the window session 
len ratingfour The look of it is great but the all round performance kinda slowed down which is a big no no for me but I hope to see this get corrected in the next update 
len ratingfive I ve never reviewed and app before but I just wanted to take the time to say I really enjoy this newest version of the app 
len ratingfive It is not as snazzy as previous version and even seems plain at times but all of the new functionality and ease of use you gain from this redesign is awesome 
len ratingtwo Technology ultimately changes and streamlines this I accept 
len ratingtwo That being said I do not like this redesign 
len ratingtwo Now there is little difference between it and safari 
len ratingtwo I will continue to use it and maybe my current opinion will be changed 
len ratingone I used to like Chrome for all the ways it looked different and worked differently than Safari which I hate 
len ratingone This version of Chrome looks like Safari with the imitation address bar up top and the nav arrows and other stuff on the bottom 
len ratingone Other placement and feel issues annoy as well 
len ratingone This version changed Chrome for the worse 
len ratingone I am ready to use a third browser as a result 
len ratingtwo It s great how the functions are all consolidated at the bottom for easy access 
len ratingtwo I like the open tab display 
len ratingtwo I Hate that when you bookmark you Can t choose the folder you have to edit the just saved bookmark 
len ratingtwo And the Bookmark save confirmation COVERS all of the functions for seconds so you can t close the tab or do anything else 
len ratingtwo You sit there and watch the black bar prevent you from doing anything 
len ratingtwo And no way to bookmark multiple pages 
len ratingtwo PLEASE GET THIS BAR OUT OF MY WAY I DON T Need to look at it 
len ratingtwo Hate that it looks like safari now
len ratingone After releasing this horrific new interface I m going back to using safari 
len ratingone  I like that I can see all of my tabs easier now but it just looks like a Safari knockoff and I ve never even liked Safari
len ratingone Loved Google was using it often 
len ratingone The new design looks like Safari design I have not used safari because of its inconvenient structure 
len ratingone Sadly google chrome now has the same structure 
len ratingone Upsetting inconvenient 
len ratingone For years I have stubbornly stuck with Chrome 
len ratingone If I could I would have deleted the Safari app off my phone that s how convinced I was that I was never going to leave google until the September redesign 
len ratingone The app has essentially become Safari with a worse tab UI 
len ratingone Instead of scrolling through tabs like normal they re displayed in a small harder to read grid that serves no logical purpose just makes things harder to select 
len ratingone As some one who frequently has multiple tabs open articles stories etc that I was to come back to this is a MAJOR problem 
len ratingone Am desperately seeking an alternative browser because as is this is unusable to be 
len ratingfour With the new design it doesn t let me use google calendar in desktop mode
len ratingthree I saw the update liked it then got annoyed because every time in google images when you try to exit out of an image it takes you back to your prior search instead of the rest of the images I was looking at
len ratingone At least bring back one finger swipe to close a tab
len ratingtwo It has an awful layout 
len ratingtwo Why is the task bar on the bottom now 
len ratingtwo They had no reason to do that it was fine where it was 
len ratingtwo In addition to this it closely resembles Safari which is a terrible browser in my opinion 
len ratingtwo It s inefficient and very hard to figure out where things are 
len ratingtwo And I am NOT a fan of the layout looking so much like Safari 
len ratingtwo I think you guys should just change it back to its old layout 
len ratingtwo I used to love Chrome before the update and would use it all the time but I don t think I can now 
len ratingone I have been using Chrome on Android and iOS for years 
len ratingone Always been the same layout 
len ratingone Why force me to use this new layout 
len ratingone I get it s been changed for folks with smaller fingers that can t reach the top of the screen one handed but that s never been a problem for me 
len ratingone In fact it s more comfortable for me to reach for the top of the screen 
len ratingone First few times I opened Chrome I assumed I was in Safari 
len ratingone I greatly prefer the old layout 
len ratingone  I don t like Google because they suppress conservative free speech 
len ratingone They should stop imposing their left wing bias and allow legal speech 
len ratingone Accordingly Google should be regulated by Congress to not be evil 
len ratingfive I love the new UI 
len ratingfive It makes using it so much nicer can t wait for it to translate to the iPad 
len ratingone after open window i cant open full screen onle can see icons with window
len ratingone Now it just has all the features I hated about safari 
len ratingone Switching to Cake
len ratingthree Why does it basically look like Safari now 
len ratingthree I ll still use google because of my account plus I rely on it for maintaining all my google apps connected but seriously it just feels like using Safari 
len ratingthree Imo not an upgrade didn t need one 
len ratingone  Since the latest update pages are short margined and cut the sente so I have to guess at what it was t iter was trying to say 
len ratingone Also an issu he bottom margin that won t allow access the save or enter butto ome web pages 
len ratingone Third I use the Ch owser because I liked the layout N s just like safari which I don t like i Either put the controls back where t ere or at least give us an option to r back to the older version 
len ratingone It s annoying trying to piece together a sentence when half of the word is missing isn t it 
len ratingone The new interface is awful 
len ratingone Love Chrome but this new mobile app is not good 
len ratingtwo Do not like 
len ratingtwo It is now alot more like safari 
len ratingtwo Would like old layout back 
len ratingtwo Just please bring back the swipe gesture to close tabs having to click a tiny little x to close tabs is not as user friendly as the previous design in which you could just swipe a tab away easily 
len ratingtwo  The new update is horrible 
len ratingtwo I might as well use Safari now 
len ratingtwo Put it back to how it was 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari on my iPhone I would use Safari 
len ratingone This new chrome is garbage you Google
len ratingone Hate the layout change
len ratingone This last update simply destroyed what was an incredible browser the new look and feel is pure junk 
len ratingone Your ugly new update changed everything around and y all did not get my consent before pushing it through on my device 
len ratingone Your app is garbage now thanks for nothing
len ratingtwo Love chrome the way it was don t really like this layout 
len ratingthree  has the ugliest ui
len ratingone Hate the update
len ratingone  Ive never had an issue with chrome and liked the layout it had I don t think it needed this massive of a redesign 
len ratingone It feels like a safari clone and I liked chrome because I didn t like safari s layout 
len ratingone New UI wastes a lot of space
len ratingfive This chrome update looks AMAZING on iPhone 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone Not sure who thought this was a good idea but this looks like safari the layout is obnoxiously bad don t know where anything is anymore 
len ratingone Too drastic of a change too fas 
len ratingone Bad 
len ratingfive This is one of the best browser redesigns for mobile I have experienced in a long time 
len ratingfive Great job Google 
len ratingone Why ON EARTH would you think people wanted Chrome to look like safari 
len ratingone I absolutely HATE this update 
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingone I loved the way Chrome used to work now it s a knockoff of safari which I avoid like the plague 
len ratingone If people were willing to download your browser on iOS instead of using the one that CAME ON THE PHONE WHY would you think it s a good idea to make your browser like that one 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone At least add an option to change the layout to the old one or keep the new one for the VERY small percentage of people who like this change 
len ratingone Clunky clearing tabs isn t the same really not a fan
len ratingone This was better than other browsers because of the layout now that you ve changed it there s no reason to prefer it over anything 
len ratingone  This update is awful 
len ratingone I use Chrome over Safari because I want the tabs on the top not in a screen of tiles 
len ratingone Not an improvement in any way at all but a change for the sake of change 
len ratingone There needs to be a setting to show tabs the old way or a way to revert this whole mess 
len ratingone The light blue and white in the settings menu is also difficult to read and looks unprofessional 
len ratingone I hate this 
len ratingone  Used to love this browser used it on all my devices for years 
len ratingone Now I m seconding everyone else s sentiments that it s now making my want to switch to another browser the new look layout is garbage since the most recent update 
len ratingone Please give me an option to switch back to Classic mode 
len ratingone I don t want the toolbar on the bottom and I don t want it auto hiding on me 
len ratingone If I wanted a browser that looked an functioned just like Safari I would just use Safari 
len ratingfour Liking the new update and revamped UI but one thing I think you should bring back is swiping tabs to close them 
len ratingfour It just seems much more intuitive than only being able to click the X to close 
len ratingthree I LOVED the way Chrome was laid out before this stupid update 
len ratingthree It looks more like Safari now and if I wanted that I D USE SAFARI 
len ratingone The bottom toolbar looks cheap like safari 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingthree Always trying to do too much instead of just focusing on perfecting your basics 
len ratingthree I don t understand 
len ratingtwo The iOS experience is clunky and not at all as elegant as I would have presumed 
len ratingtwo Bottom anchored menu I am not impressed with the bottom anchored menu 
len ratingtwo I find it awkward in composition and function 
len ratingtwo Why make such a dramatic change 
len ratingtwo Icon size And why make the elements of the visual UI so large 
len ratingtwo Incognito mode Why is this so prominent 
len ratingtwo Every time I look at tabs I see this option 
len ratingtwo Other than new tab it is the only other universal in that view 
len ratingtwo This is essentially and intentionally a portal for hiding behavior deceit or re paywall violation theft 
len ratingtwo Please see your choice of a spy icon if you don t think that s clear 
len ratingtwo I get that we have this feature and that people want this feature 
len ratingtwo I don t want to be invited into it times a day 
len ratingtwo I think that s awful weak posture from a company that used to not want to do evil 
len ratingone Seriously 
len ratingone I used google chrome for a reason 
len ratingone Now it looks and feels just like ugly non user friendly safari 
len ratingone This is just so stupid 
len ratingone Change it back 
len ratingtwo I got the update and it moves slow and crashes 
len ratingtwo I want the old chrome
len ratingtwo So I ve been using chrome from the moment i could way back on my iphone 
len ratingtwo It was just straight better than safari in every way 
len ratingtwo This update has me a tad concerned 
len ratingtwo I will say some of the new visual tweaks are lovely and while i like them more on the desktop version i still think they work well on the mobile app 
len ratingtwo The change to the tab list in particular while shocking at first is actually quite nice both visually and functionally 
len ratingtwo But please please please at least make it an OPTION to change the navigation bar tool bar back to the way it was or even just move it back to the top if the new style is a must stay 
len ratingtwo I read that it was moved to the bottom for easier navigation but it does nothing to help me in any way 
len ratingtwo In fact the bottom tool bar is the main reason I abandoned safari in favor of chrome in the first place 
len ratingtwo I have rather large thumbs and they drift onto the screen every now and again 
len ratingtwo Before that was no big deal but now it means i keep accidentally navigating away from the page i was on or pulling up the tab window 
len ratingtwo It s also made clicking links near the bottom of a page a major pain since the bar pops up OVER the web page rather than being safely outside the page as it was before 
len ratingtwo I in no way want to stop using chrome i think it s a wonderful browser but if i can t move the main function bar back to an actually useful location i know my frustrations are gonna get the better of me sooner rather than later and i ll have to jump ship 
len ratingone Was my go to browser on iOS but this new update is garbage 
len ratingone Why change a great functional app so drastically 
len ratingone The toolbar at the bottom is the worst feature of all 
len ratingthree I miss the ability to swipe away tab thumbnails 
len ratingthree WAY too much real estate wasted on margins padding headers footers etc 
len ratingthree I hope it gets tweaked in the future because this is painful 
len ratingone Loved the old chrome but the new UI rolled out on is ugly aggravating and a safari ripoff 
len ratingone Wish I could rollback the version to the last version and keep old UI so I could give a star review
len ratingone I hate the new update 
len ratingone It s confusing to use and it s actually harder to get to things that before 
len ratingone Instead of updating this why don t you make it easier to buy google play since it takes and hour to finally find where to purchase it 
len ratingone It s trash the layout is a copy of Safari and the toolbar on the bottom is in the way completely 
len ratingone Why even update it 
len ratingone The interface was fine prior to this one 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone I hated the Safari layout and now you re just a Safari copycat 
len ratingone What the heck 
len ratingone If I could give stars I WOULD 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Apple Safari I would not have downloaded your app 
len ratingone Why would you make yourself look like a knockoff Apple browser 
len ratingthree I have to be honest I m not really a fan for the new design the old one was great and worked perfectly for me other than that I haven t seen any changes and it does work 
len ratingone I use Google Chrome because I hate the other browsers 
len ratingone They just updated it to look like the other browsers 
len ratingone  In my opinion it is much harder to use and navigate the internet 
len ratingfive Really like the changes to the browser 
len ratingfour So I ve used google chrome for a long time 
len ratingfour It s a good browser and I really don t have any complaints 
len ratingfour I do have to say though that I m somewhat confused 
len ratingfour This morning when I opened chrome I thought I had opened safari by accident 
len ratingfour When I checked again it was chrome 
len ratingfour All I really have to say is I m kind of disappointed 
len ratingfour It looks like someone said How can we make chrome better for apple users 
len ratingfour Oh let s make it look like safari Well despite the features I ve used chrome in the past because it didn t look like safari 
len ratingfour Because it was it s own 
len ratingfour Just something to think about I guess
len ratingone Confusing how do I uninstall updates
len ratingone The new version is total trash the GUI is horrible 
len ratingone Why did they totally revamp the browser to look a copy of the browser 
len ratingone They literally stole Safaris design 
len ratingone I loved Chrome s uniqueness with its old layout and now it just looks like it s copying Safari 
len ratingone THIS IS WHY I DOWNLOADED CHROME IT WAS DIFFERENT 
len ratingone Now I am DISAPPOINTED it s harder to use now 
len ratingone The new update I use chrome specifically because it wasn t like safari 
len ratingone I like my back button on the top 
len ratingone My tabs button on the top 
len ratingone This is just bs 
len ratingone I am now for the first time years looking for a new browser 
len ratingone Shame on you 
len ratingone Weak af 
len ratingone This is the worst update 
len ratingone As another person wrote I don t like safari that s why I use google 
len ratingone I HATE this update 
len ratingone I would give stars if it were an option 
len ratingone The new layout is similar to safari 
len ratingone I really prefer the old chrome look 
len ratingone I hate how this looks 
len ratingone It is crap 
len ratingfive Oof out of oof
len ratingtwo This could be a great app but updating the new looking still doesn t fix current issues 
len ratingtwo Every time I switch tabs the page has to reload 
len ratingtwo It s so annoying waiting searching where you left off in a previous tab 
len ratingtwo Why is it so hard to fix that 
len ratingfive Less hassle the better
len ratingfive  I approve the new updates more convenient
len ratingone The toolbar at the bottom is awful 
len ratingone I type in a search at the TOP so that s where I m already looking 
len ratingone I open multitudes of webpages in new tabs which I do FREQUENTLY when looking for a particular item while staying on the main google search page so I can continue to open more tabs and then when I m ready during or after that I can quickly go and look at each of the webpages that are up behind my main google search page and toggle between them and change my search words as needed 
len ratingone Toggling between webpages and changing my search words parameters was all at the top of the browser and now I have to go to the top then the bottom then the top then the bottom etc 
len ratingone RIDICULOUS 
len ratingone That s one of the main reasons I used Chrome rather than Safari 
len ratingone The whole purpose of me downloading Google Chrome years ago was because of the fact I didn t like Safari 
len ratingone Now you guys made a copy of Safari 
len ratingone Sure you added a separate tab interface which looks nice but the rest of the interface reminds me of Safari 
len ratingone Go back to your original please 
len ratingtwo This latest iOS version may finally have driven me to a different browser at least for iOS because it no longer displays the URL for the actual page something that I use frequently 
len ratingone I need the refresh reload button in the address bar back
len ratingtwo There are lots of reasons I loved chrome and used it over other browsers 
len ratingtwo They ruined a lot of those reasons with this new UI 
len ratingtwo One of my favorite things was having the back button in the top left just like any browser on a computer and like most apps I use 
len ratingtwo Now it is in the bottom left and everything else is all bubbly and trying too hard to be modern and minimalistic while just making it feel clunky and less straightforward to use 
len ratingtwo I love chrome but hate this update 
len ratingone I hate the updated app 
len ratingone My bars are gone n all saved bookmarks gone also 
len ratingone Every time I open app on homepage a different screen comes up 
len ratingone I have to hunt for a way to open google 
len ratingone It should be my choice to change the app 
len ratingone I want old one back with my saved info or I m going to use different browser 
len ratingone I HATE IT
len ratingone It s too much like safari 
len ratingone Safari s layout is why I used Chrome 
len ratingone Please give an option to use the old version 
len ratingone As a software developer myself I ll never understand sweeping UI changes 
len ratingone Incremental will always be better received by the users 
len ratingone If Google needs a new Project Manager for the Chrome team to avoid future messups I could be persuaded to work there 
len ratingone Lol 
len ratingone Fix this mess 
len ratingone I used Chrome because it wasn t Safari and this latest update makes it far too similar 
len ratingone The layout is not intuitive the entire look is too round and bubbly and feels garish and awful 
len ratingone I don t understand why developers can t adhere to if it s not broken don t fix it 
len ratingone I want to return to the old app 
len ratingone This is horrible 
len ratingone Takes forever 
len ratingone The pages don t load right 
len ratingone I have to find the search bar every time I want to use 
len ratingone I need the old app or else I might as well use he crappy Safari because they are nearly alike 
len ratingone I loved Chrome because it was so much better than Safari 
len ratingone Now the UI is so similar to Safari I thought I was using the wrong browser 
len ratingone It was a five star app now searching requires you to go back to the top if you want to stay in images for instance 
len ratingone The overall feel is just much colder 
len ratingone Not being able to see full page tabs and the now inability to swipe them away is also an odd choice 
len ratingone It s just an overall bad decision 
len ratingone I wish I hadn t updated 
len ratingone Thank for not making this available for iOS now 
len ratingone Can t download it on my iPhone 
len ratingone Stinks because all the schools use google chrome 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingone It s so annoying that all the menus are in the bottom 
len ratingone This update makes the browser dramatically slower and clunkier to use 
len ratingone Vastly prefer it mirroring the look of my computer browser so it is easier to go between them
len ratingthree Webpages not rendering as mobile while on iPhone after new update 
len ratingone Where you guys trying to be more approachable with a modern look 
len ratingone The bubbly look is horrible 
len ratingone For a second I though I had opened the Safari app the browser that I hate for its layout 
len ratingone You guys went and got a similar style to Safari 
len ratingone Wth 
len ratingone I don t really pay attention to updates but man you guys even got me irritated enough to write a review on it 
len ratingone Rollback to the old interface pls 
len ratingthree I downloaded chrome because it looked new and innovative and now it s just completely copied the safari look 
len ratingthree Next it ll probably run as slow as safari 
len ratingone Another improvement that completely failed 
len ratingone Chrome was outstanding functioning like a desk top browser 
len ratingone This one is a giant step backwards 
len ratingone Please roll back to the previous 
len ratingone  Only reason I used Chrome was it s one of the few browsers that still has the toolbar at the top 
len ratingone Now that s gone 
len ratingone For god s sake at least give us the OPTION to choose where the toolbar is
len ratingone Previously whenever I got a new phone Google Chrome was the first app I would install 
len ratingone Unless they revert the changes I don t see that happening again 
len ratingone This new UI is horrendous 
len ratingone I don t understand because the previous version was quite polished and looked really nice in my opinion 
len ratingone I loved using Chrome because the usability was so much better than Safari 
len ratingone I was very disappointed to open my app and find a Safari look alike I m Chrome now 
len ratingone If that s the case I might as well switch back 
len ratingone The update is horrible 
len ratingone It s basically just safari 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari then I would ve been using it all along 
len ratingfour  I m all for everything google I love what these guys have done with the world 
len ratingfour I use their apps across all my devices 
len ratingfour I m not going to lie I was surprised when Chrome was updated to this new version 
len ratingfour I don t get used to a bottom toolbar and I miss having my tabs at the top 
len ratingfour Other than that keep up the good work Google 
len ratingone I don t understand the switch to the bottom toolbar that looks an awful lot like Safari 
len ratingone The reason I started using chrome on my iPhone yes original iPhone before the s was released years ago was that these buttons were on the top and not the bottom like Safari 
len ratingone I might as well switch back or check for other browser apps available now as this was has become just as backwards as that 
len ratingone This new UI looks like it came straight out of chrome on Windows XP 
len ratingone Please revert not nice on the eyes 
len ratingone Also password extensions don t work like LastPass and password auto fill 
len ratingone Horrible update and redesign 
len ratingone Roll back 
len ratingone I guess the question now is how long will I keep chrome 
len ratingone I fail to see the value of this update and revamped layout 
len ratingone If I wanted something that was like safari I would just use safari 
len ratingone Am I the only one that finds this new update to be ridiculous 
len ratingone If I turn on my pc am I going to get the same asinine layout update 
len ratingone This new version they somehow managed to screw up every single feature of what made the previous version great 
len ratingone Horrible
len ratingone I use chrome on my windows laptop my android phone and ipad and I like to sync news articles to my ipad for easy reading the problem is the tab syncing page is hard to find and it simply don t sync when i need it to usually it will wait for a few minutes to appear the newest tabs from other device meanwhile all i can do is stairing at the day old synced page 
len ratingone So please give me a sync page button and make the sync page easier to use 
len ratingfour Type chrome flags into the URL 
len ratingfour Scroll search to UI Refresh Phase 
len ratingfour Select disabled then restart the app Boom 
len ratingfour No more Safari esque interface 
len ratingtwo The tab switch screen won t let me switch to a currently open tab 
len ratingtwo Looks pretty though 
len ratingone Not a fan of the new interface 
len ratingone It looks cheesy and hard to navigate 
len ratingone The main reason we use chrome on Apple is because the interface it the opposite with the navigation at the top and less child like look to it 
len ratingone Very disappointed
len ratingone The new update makes Chrome look like Safari 
len ratingone If I have to use a browser that looks like Safari im going to just use Safari 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome my old friend 
len ratingone If I browse to YouTube and try to play a video only the audio plays 
len ratingone The video itself will not 
len ratingone I don t like it at all google supposed to be different from other internet but now it like the same plz bring the original google back ppppplllllleeeeaaaasssse
len ratingfive I almost never write reviews but this last update is really good 
len ratingfive Seeing and closing tabs is much easier and there s less room for error when trying to close a specific tab than there was with the fan layout before 
len ratingfive Controls moved to the bottom for easier access is a no brainer Safari has been set up like that ages so it s great to see it in Chrome 
len ratingfive Having a search button that automatically puts the focus in the address bar is probably my favorite update 
len ratingfive It is SO nice and I don t know how I did without it after only using it for a day 
len ratingfive The only thing that would make this absolutely amazing would be ad blocking add ons 
len ratingfive Overall though awesome update 
len ratingone The toolbar at the bottom is much worse 
len ratingone There should at least be an option 
len ratingone This one change had made the experience way worse 
len ratingone Please change to old browser setup 
len ratingone After using nothing but Chrome as a browser for years and years the newest update has made the decision for me to switch 
len ratingone How could you ruin something so great with this absolute junk you just released as an update 
len ratingone I downloaded chrome because I hate the layout of safari 
len ratingone Now it looks exactly like safari 
len ratingone This update basically turns Chrome into Safari 
len ratingone I don t like Safari hence me using Chrome 
len ratingone All this does is place all the obnoxious ads in the way obstructing what I wanted to see 
len ratingone It feels like there are more ads than usual since the new update 
len ratingone I can t find anything browser windows are clunky to navigate to everything is gray and overall it looks terrible 
len ratingone Can I opt out of this and just go back to the original Chrome 
len ratingone This new design Google has came up with constantly keeps covering up any selection I m trying to use at the top of the screen 
len ratingone And now the navigation of the search engine that I have chose to use for a long time now the navigation buttons don t work 
len ratingone I m considering getting rid of chrome now 
len ratingone Yep jumping on the bandwagon here and saying I loved Chrome until they pulled these shenanigans 
len ratingone Give us an option to move it to the top or bottom 
len ratingone Terrible interface 
len ratingone Don t copy Safari 
len ratingone Don t put the main function keys on the bottom as it is harder to reach 
len ratingone Everything about it sucks 
len ratingone In the past as you read all the tool bars at the top would go away 
len ratingone I don t see that happening now that I m on Chrome for iOS 
len ratingone When it does reduce I see a FB a Twitter to share the content which is more of a mistake 
len ratingone Seems like lots of mistakes are in my future 
len ratingone i hate it why dock bar is located bottom 
len ratingone so unconvenient
len ratingtwo I like the way this new update looks but it s not as easy to use as it was before 
len ratingtwo I miss swiping to close windows and it s difficult for me to find things I used
len ratingone If I wanted backwards hard to grasp navigation I would use safari 
len ratingone But I don t 
len ratingone The reason being that I do not adapt to new technology and technological changes easily 
len ratingone I am a millennial but I happen to get along with technology like I m 
len ratingone Please if you re going to make drastic changes do it in steps so people like me are not floored by the confusion 
len ratingtwo I loved the former setup now it just looks like a glorified Safari 
len ratingone Performance is worse with the new update 
len ratingone Changes to the user experience seem to have been done just to be different 
len ratingone This is the first time in a decade I won t be using chrome on my phone 
len ratingthree  I ve been putting up with it for a week and it s still annoying me
len ratingtwo  The new version feels smoother and feels like there is less lag than before 
len ratingtwo I am expecting it to perform just as solid as ever 
len ratingtwo It s a big change all at once and I get that it s frustrating for us long time users 
len ratingtwo With that said New UI is less than pleasing 
len ratingtwo Feels far too much like Safari 
len ratingtwo With all the awesome minds I am disappointed this would be a the final product 
len ratingtwo This really has the look and feel of an early iOS app 
len ratingtwo Really enjoyed the old tabs and have already closed out all my open tabs in error 
len ratingtwo I like everyone else it seems missed this update was coming 
len ratingtwo Went with the assumption it was just optimized to work better with iOS 
len ratingtwo So much opportunity to inovate and change how we browse the internet 
len ratingtwo I can only imagine the time spent to make this and to that end why not change the game all together 
len ratingone When I first got an iPhone I hated Safari 
len ratingone It was such a pain to go on the internet on my phone up until the day that I figured out there was a google chrome mobile app 
len ratingone Ever since then my online experience was amazing I loved using my phone 
len ratingone However the most recent update to the UI is terrible I want the old one back 
len ratingone Please bring it back 
len ratingone If it s brought back I ll go to stars
len ratingfive Just updated to the new UI for chrome 
len ratingfive Was a bit taken back at first and thought I had clicked on Safari by accident 
len ratingfive Certainly a bit different than Google s usual UI theme and is most comparable to that of Apple but I m not complaining 
len ratingfive Hats off to you guys 
len ratingfive Great update 
len ratingone I don t like the new update 
len ratingone It s slower the layout is confusing I miss the old layout 
len ratingone I wish I didn t have auto update and still kept the old one 
len ratingone The new design is lacking 
len ratingone Before I realized it was Chrome updated I was browsing Facebook and thought it was a FB internal browser 
len ratingone Then I realized it was Chrome and was very disappointed 
len ratingone However I guess it s still better than Safari 
len ratingone The old format was so much better 
len ratingone They just wanted it to look like Safari 
len ratingone everything is suddenly so different and it won t allow me to undo the update 
len ratingone I highly dislike this and would like to be allowed to use the older version if I so choose
len ratingone Google just completely rehauled the UI and the change took Chrome from being a ubiquitous Google product to an Apple esque product 
len ratingone Before it was functional fast easy to use and aesthetically plain 
len ratingone That s all been forfeited for a super sleek modern design that s less user friendly and a complete from the design of the last three years 
len ratingone The menu bar went from the top of the screen to the bottom 
len ratingone There s less options to choose from 
len ratingone It s harder to move between tabs 
len ratingone It s slower 
len ratingone This is not a change I expected from Google and I m so disappointed 
len ratingone I ll be looking for a new browser next 
len ratingone The most recent update is causing my chrome to freeze 
len ratingone I can t even open up the browser without it getting stuck on the loading screen 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingthree I really dislike the new interface 
len ratingthree Everything is overly smooth and flipped upside down of what it should be 
len ratingthree Liked the old version much more 
len ratingone I ve always hated the interface of Safari and most other mobile browsers 
len ratingone Chrome has been my trusty faithful go to for years for its uncluttered utilitarian approach 
len ratingone Imagine my surprise horror when I opened chrome today and was nearly smacked in the face with an obnoxious Safari knock off 
len ratingone Navigational buttons are more awkward to get to while holding a phone at the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone PLEASE 
len ratingone IF SOMEONE AT GOOGLE IS READING THESE REVIEWS PRETTY PLEASE WITH SUGAR ON TOP GO BACK TO THE OLD LAYOUT 
len ratingone I have been using Google Chrome since it came out on desktop and I ve always loved the mobile version but this new update completely redesigned the set up of it and now it just feels like a weird different version of Safari I don t like Safari at all 
len ratingone I find the button set up annoying I don t like the bottom task bar at all on any browser that has it 
len ratingone I m thinking about changing to a new browser very upset about this
len ratingone It s mostly a personal taste but I preferred it being at the top 
len ratingone Also switching between tabs is strange since making the new tab button is at the bottom but the tabs are always positioned at the top of the screen 
len ratingthree The redesigned layout is now basically Safari 
len ratingthree This pointless change made using Chrome obnoxious 
len ratingone The new ui is terrible 
len ratingone Please move the nav buttons to the top 
len ratingone They take the worst part about safari and put it in chrome 
len ratingone  The newest update is the worst Google Chrome I ve seen yet 
len ratingone The layout looks far too much like Safari an app which I dislike precisely because of its layout 
len ratingone The previous layout was awesome bring it back 
len ratingone Whole reason I have chrome is because I hate safari 
len ratingone Now since it doesn t matter no longer need chrome 
len ratingone Also you screwed up google finance so badly I now use yahoo finance 
len ratingone Keep it up guys 
len ratingone Not a fan of the new design 
len ratingone What separated chrome from safari was the design and functionality 
len ratingone Now that you have a new design it s no different from safari which is a huge let down 
len ratingone Highly recommend u bring back the old look 
len ratingone Worked much better and easier to navigate 
len ratingone If it ain t broken don t fix it 
len ratingone It is difficult to go from one screen to the next 
len ratingone It is difficult to have multiple windows accessible r open 
len ratingone You cannot close out the window 
len ratingone That s for starters 
len ratingfour Is there any way I can change the format that was recently rolled out in the update to the old format 
len ratingfour Its not for me and I d like to be able to use the old version if at all possible 
len ratingone I hate the new update 
len ratingone Moving everything from the top of the screen to the bottom made everything awkward search wise 
len ratingfive  For listening to your customers 
len ratingfive That update was the worst 
len ratingfive Thanks for switching back to my favorite browser
len ratingone Please go back to the old look 
len ratingone I m not liking the redesign at all 
len ratingone It feels too bubbly and garish 
len ratingone Simply put I liked Chrome s design and setup precisely because its user interface was different from other browser apps out there 
len ratingone Safari s UI just wasn t as intuitive or user friendly to me so I appreciated the fact that Chrome had a different approach to layout and design that worked much better for my brain 
len ratingone These changes don t make as much sense to me from a user friendly perspective and I genuinely don t understand the need to change designs to look and act like the other major web browser app that people have and use 
len ratingone Why was that necessary 
len ratingone I personally don t think it was and I would be very curious to know why and how this decision was made 
len ratingone The new update looks terrible 
len ratingone I hate that all of the features are moved around it s clunky and outdated looking 
len ratingone This is literally the ugliest update i have seen so far it s very bubbly and inconvenient too much in trying to make it modern and compact instead of convenient and comfortable
len ratingthree I can t really stand the way it s formatted the previous one is the only reason I didn t go on safari because I loved the way it looked and was so easily accessible 
len ratingthree This one resembles safari way too much 
len ratingthree PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK 
len ratingone Change the ui back to what it was 
len ratingone You completely ruined the browser 
len ratingone  I m not a fan of the UI changes but I can deal with it 
len ratingone However every other web page I pull up is bugged and all the controls go away 
len ratingone I can t change tabs or use my navigation buttons so I just have to swipe up and to the side to close the tab and pick another 
len ratingone It s really annoying 
len ratingone The new UI doesn t feel as intuitive as the old one 
len ratingone It s a lot harder to use and wasn t needed 
len ratingfive Love the new update 
len ratingone Change it back
len ratingone There is a reason I use chrome on my phone and that is because it s not safari 
len ratingone Then this update makes it more like safari 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone I love chrome I never use safari because I can t stand its layout but this new update of chrome is terrible it s like I m using safari 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I would use safari 
len ratingone Change it back 
len ratingone There was nothing wrong with the old chrome 
len ratingtwo I really liked the interface of Chrome 
len ratingtwo It was fairly similar to adjust to from the PC because they are so similar 
len ratingtwo Now I have to adapt to this new interface that looks similar to Safari 
len ratingtwo I dislike Safari s interface with the tabs and other settings in a low bar because I felt that it was inconvenient 
len ratingtwo Now that Chrome has switched to this new interface I find it very difficult to adjust my mind on this system especially since this is the browser that I only use 
len ratingtwo I do like that I can access many of the settings e g 
len ratingtwo History without having to open up a new tab 
len ratingtwo Other than this there weren t any issues the previous interface 
len ratingtwo It would be lovely if the developers reach back for a conversation with this 
len ratingtwo If not then either give us the option to use the previous interface or undo the update 
len ratingone As thousands of others have said in the last week this update is an abomination 
len ratingone As a UX designer this is the single most puzzling UX decision I ve witnessed as a very early Chrome user 
len ratingone How such drastic and disjointed changes could actually see the light of day is truly puzzling especially given Google s tendency towards conservative visual updates eg 
len ratingone the I m feeling lucky button 
len ratingone Moving the action bar to the bottom has effectively eliminated my primary reason for using Chrome instead of Safari 
len ratingone I was never able to stomach this layout in Safari and it is equally unpalatable in Chrome now 
len ratingone Consider this a prime window of opportunity for another capable browser to get traction 
len ratingone Hate the new look might as well just use safari now loved chrome before this trash update
len ratingone  If it ain t broke why fix it 
len ratingone So now Chrome just looks like Safari 
len ratingone Not exactly innovative 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone Dumbs this browser down to nothing 
len ratingone Can t see full URL anymore 
len ratingone No options to go back to old way 
len ratingone Looks like safari 
len ratingone It was fine the way it was 
len ratingone This new UI looks and feels like safari not a fan 
len ratingone Why change what works fine 
len ratingfive Much easier and simpler to use than before 
len ratingone The reason people like using chrome was because the browser was the fastest out there and the interface was so simplistic 
len ratingone It allowed me to get to websites quickly without having a bunch of crap all over the bottom of the screen 
len ratingone Please change it back don t be known as the company that copied a different companies work be know as the company that makes the perfect browser
len ratingtwo Y all took two footsteps back 
len ratingtwo Y all should of kept it how it was look like y all tried to copy safari 
len ratingone Like other reviewers here I am not a fan of the new look 
len ratingone It does indeed feel like Safari which I don t use because I don t like the format 
len ratingone It wasn t broken Now it is 
len ratingone Trash update
len ratingone The new layout appears to be a regression 
len ratingone I used Chrome because the interface was better than Safari in ever way now I m not so sure any part of Chrome s interface is better than Safari 
len ratingfour plz add inspect element its really handy
len ratingone Plz return google chrome to old version this version is worse than safari 
len ratingone  For those who want the old UI Go to chrome flags ui refresh phase Change to disabled Close and reopen the app
len ratingone I really don t like the new design of the Google Chrome app 
len ratingone The design of the Google Chrome app is the main reason why I used it over it the Safari app 
len ratingone Now it looks exactly like the Safari app which is so annoying 
len ratingone Please go back to the original design 
len ratingone The new update turns a once great browser into a safari clone 
len ratingone If you have not done the update do not do it 
len ratingone You should double check to make sure whoever designed this doesn t work for whoever designed safari 
len ratingone It looks weirdly similar 
len ratingone I hated the safari design 
len ratingone I much preferred chrome 
len ratingone Now the only reason I see staying with chrome is that you have my saved passwords and auto fill info 
len ratingone I had to do a double take to make sure I opened up chrome but the UI is not enjoyable 
len ratingone I use chrome for the similar type menuing I get on Dekstop but on mobile as well 
len ratingone If it s gonna be an uglier version of safari why use it 
len ratingtwo So Google turned into safari 
len ratingtwo Lol 
len ratingtwo Might as well delete and just use the app your emulating so badly since it came in my phone already 
len ratingone Looks like any other browser now 
len ratingone I loved having the top sites displayed on the home page as I used all of the links regularly 
len ratingone Now it s been cut to and I ve lost my shortcuts 
len ratingone The new update made the system not clean at all 
len ratingone In every browser settings are usually located at the top not bottom 
len ratingone Also the clean design is worse 
len ratingone I much prefer the old style with sharper edges 
len ratingone Everything just looks bubbly and bad 
len ratingone It s way too similar to Safari which is a worse platform 
len ratingone I also preferred having the URL right there at the top 
len ratingone There should be at least an option to have to old style 
len ratingthree My chrome app just updated and the interface is ugly now it was perfect before
len ratingone yep 
len ratingone Please change it back to the old ui 
len ratingone It looks like someone copy pasted a worse version of safari into the browser 
len ratingone The reason I liked it was because it didn t look like safari
len ratingone Google why make your update look exactly like the browser that I use Chrome to avoid 
len ratingone Hate the new update 
len ratingone No reason not to use the safari browser now 
len ratingone I really don t get the decision to copy Apple s browser layout 
len ratingone The new layout is reminiscent of Safari which I specifically downloaded chrome to avoid 
len ratingone  please pull a Snapchat and change this nonsense back 
len ratingone Y all if it ain t broke don t fix it
len ratingone I never like the safari browser it s visually unappealing 
len ratingone I downloaded chrome so I didn t have to deal with it 
len ratingone Changing everything literally turning the app upside down is the worst update idea since Snapchat 
len ratingone I have never been more disappointed in google than I was after updating my browser 
len ratingone Looks like Safari 
len ratingone I don t care for Safari I preferred the PC look of the Chrome app I had before this update 
len ratingone That look was your advantage on the Apple products I use 
len ratingone  This new UI looks like it came straight out of chrome on Windows XP 
len ratingone Please revert not nice on the eyes 
len ratingone Don t like it at all 
len ratingone Please change it back
len ratingtwo The latest Chrome now looks like Safari which I hate so why use Chrome 
len ratingtwo Give us back our user interface at least as an option 
len ratingthree Why did you change the look 
len ratingthree It feels like basic html and is really similar to safari I don t like it 
len ratingthree Is there a way to revert back to the original look 
len ratingfour  I like it but it keeps glitching
len ratingone Honestly hate the new UI 
len ratingone This is one step forward three steps back for chrome 
len ratingone The toolbar at the bottom is intrusive to any content you are looking at 
len ratingone It would ve been smart if they added these reachability changes as an option instead of making it the default 
len ratingone Chrome s original selling point was a single search url bar that disappeared so you can see the webpage as full screen 
len ratingone They ve redesigned it so that it s almost the same exact thing as Safari 
len ratingone Utter BS 
len ratingtwo newest update is awful 
len ratingtwo completely changed the look and feel 
len ratingtwo i liked chrome because it had all its options on top like a normal desktop browser 
len ratingtwo if i wanted it all on the bottom i would just use safari 
len ratingtwo Oooooh I loathe the new update 
len ratingtwo If I wanted Safari I d use it 
len ratingtwo I used Chrome because it DIDN T look like Safari 
len ratingtwo Terrible 
len ratingone Personally dislike the new ui 
len ratingtwo The redesign is ugly and has started crashing 
len ratingtwo I haven t been able to use the browser for a day now 
len ratingone New update weryyyyyyyy baaaad
len ratingfive  This is the browser I been using for years and always come back to 
len ratingone I do not like the new browser because it splits my keyboard in to pieces on each side of the browser 
len ratingone This makes it difficult to use on my iPad 
len ratingtwo It would be a star review but this new update is really weird please change it back 
len ratingone Chrome is unusable on IOS mobile devices such as the IPad 
len ratingone It continues to crash on random webpages and be more unstable by each new release 
len ratingone Webpages like the Washington Post are not displayed properly requiring one to constantly shrink the page to read articles which in the end causes your page to crash 
len ratingone In addition Chrome is even more slower than previous releases 
len ratingone It is clear Google has done little to fix their numerous problems nor provide any workarounds that actually work especially with webpages that have ads and multimedia 
len ratingone There are some that say these problems is due to the limitations with the Apple OS but this is bogus since one does not see any of these problems in Firefox or other non Apple browsers 
len ratingone As such one would be better off using anything than Chrome on IOS especially on mobile devices 
len ratingone If I could give this a zero star rating I would do so in a heartbeat 
len ratingfive I like the new update of this app huge thumbs up 
len ratingfive Thank you Google for making my favorite web browser even better on my iPhone thank you 
len ratingone It wasn t broken so why fix it 
len ratingone This version of chrome blows 
len ratingone Looks like a bubbly version of safari which I don t use 
len ratingone Please set it back to the original chrome 
len ratingtwo The new update is ugly to be honest 
len ratingtwo I would like a way to switch back to the previous layout 
len ratingone Whatever Google just did to change their search engine it failed 
len ratingone Go back to the way it used to be 
len ratingtwo Wow that bottom bar is extremely distracting especially as it keeps popping up inadvertently 
len ratingtwo It also clashes with other sites that have a bottom bar 
len ratingtwo What s worse is that the magnifier icon is not search within the page but a url edit which is redundant given that clicking on the url bar does exactly the same thing 
len ratingtwo Why bother with changing an already good design is beyond me 
len ratingtwo I d rather use crappy safari than this 
len ratingtwo Absolute fail 
len ratingtwo Give me back my old chrome browser If I wanted to use safari I would have 
len ratingfive This update is everything 
len ratingfive Tabs is amazing now 
len ratingfive You can organize them 
len ratingfive Great update 
len ratingthree Links to iOS App Store don t open anymore 
len ratingthree Seems to be an iOS Chrome issue 
len ratingone Please add a classic mode or compact option 
len ratingone This is not small screen friendly 
len ratingone I really dont need another inch of my screen dedicated to buttons 
len ratingone I need the features that make the top address bar hide on scroll and get rid of this bottom button bar 
len ratingone It looks like the webpages are embedded in a google search page result and Id really like that screen real estate back 
len ratingone I dont need two top bars 
len ratingone The new update is trash 
len ratingone Throw the whole app away 
len ratingfive Love the app but don t like the new layout you guys changed today change it back
len ratingone Get rid of this interactive interface and just bring back the old one it was so much better 
len ratingone The new UI is awful 
len ratingone I liked chrome because it didn t look like Safari 
len ratingone Now it s like Safari s lame and confusing cousin 
len ratingone  No 
len ratingone Do not just change the ui like this 
len ratingone It is very unappealing to the eye and makes me sick 
len ratingone You will be losing a lot of users from this change alone 
len ratingone Your lucky that the review system here requires a star to submit any reviews 
len ratingone That is the only reason you re getting star instead of the like I would prefer 
len ratingtwo Simply put I am not a fan of the new look and feel 
len ratingtwo This new product looks and feels too much like Safari to me 
len ratingtwo I have proudly used Chrome exclusively on my mobile devices for years 
len ratingtwo I am sad to say that I will likely be looking for a new mobile browser 
len ratingone As the title states he new redesigned chrome looks awful 
len ratingone If I wanted the back button and tabs at the bottom I d use safari which is terrible 
len ratingone Chrome is my go to browser but I might have to find something else to use if it says this way 
len ratingfive Very fast
len ratingone Horrible layout horrible look 
len ratingone It looks cartoonish and childlike 
len ratingone If I wanted a safari look a like I d use Safari 
len ratingone Just downright terrible update 
len ratingone Liked the old version better 
len ratingone If something s not broke don t fix it 
len ratingfive  The new design looks way better 
len ratingfive I m finally going to switch from safari to google chrome 
len ratingfive Don t change anything it s perfect 
len ratingone It looks just like safari which I was try to avoid 
len ratingone Having everything at the bottom is visually unappealing and takes up a lot of screen real estate 
len ratingone Change it back please it s awful 
len ratingone It s basically safari which I DONT LIKE TO USE
len ratingone Update is terrible 
len ratingone I got Chrome so it wouldn t be like Safari 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome for how unobtrusive it was 
len ratingone Safari had toolbars top and bottom taking up a bunch of screen real estate 
len ratingone Now Chrome has the same thing 
len ratingone Sure the new icons are rounded and cutesy but the UI is no longer as compact 
len ratingone At least give me the option for a compact UI with a single toolbar 
len ratingfive It looks so much better and easier to navigate 
len ratingfive Honestly I wasn t paying attention to what browser I was in cuz I have both Safari and Chrome open but then it hit me 
len ratingfive I really like this new interface despite of it kinda looking like Safari 
len ratingfive Honestly I don t care 
len ratingone The new poorly done Safari clone that Chrome has become deserves ZERO stars 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingone THIS IS A TERRIBLE LAYOUT PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS
len ratingfive If any programmers see this I just want to congratulate you guys on vastly improving the UI for this mobile chrome 
len ratingfive I m not one who usually writes reviews but this update is so good it required me to come here to praise it 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone The new forced UI design on the app is awful 
len ratingone It is harder to use you see less of the web pages and it now looks just like safari 
len ratingone If I wanted safari I would use safari 
len ratingone Now I need to find a new alternative 
len ratingone New update broke something 
len ratingone Can t open anything 
len ratingone I use Chrome because I dislike the layout of Safari 
len ratingone Now Chrome looks exactly like Safari 
len ratingone Absolutely horrible 
len ratingone The new UI is awful 
len ratingone It s this exact design from the competitors that kept me on Chrome in the first place 
len ratingone I HATE moving the navigation buttons on the bottom 
len ratingone CanI revert to having the back button the dots and page history on the top of the page 
len ratingfive That last update really improved big time love the new design it runs smoothly keep up the good work 
len ratingone Don t fix what isn t broken 
len ratingfive New design is more functional but the appearance is a bit clumsy 
len ratingfive I m particularly unhappy with the tab grid 
len ratingfive It looks very juvenile especially with the new style 
len ratingfive The update claims greater visibility but shifting the appearance to multiple columns with much more rounded corners actually decreases the visibility of each tab at least for me 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would not have downloaded Chrome 
len ratingone Please go back to the original 
len ratingone  Congrats you made a decent browsing app into useless horrible waste
len ratingthree It has cool new features 
len ratingthree The tool should be on the top 
len ratingthree It is annoying at the bottom that is another reason why I don t like using Safari plus the fact that it is an Apple browser 
len ratingone Forced bookmarks are not good making accessing my home page on apps a huge pain 
len ratingone I started using a different browser after updating 
len ratingone Truly aggravating 
len ratingone If I wanted an interface like safari I would have stuck with that 
len ratingone Put my bar back on top 
len ratingone Very disappointed
len ratingone If I had enjoyed a Safari layout I would have already been using it 
len ratingone Either fix it or I ll use the original 
len ratingone My phone defaults to Safari anyway 
len ratingone Not gonna bog down my phone with a carbon copy of another app 
len ratingone What were you thinking google 
len ratingone Fix this ASAP 
len ratingtwo One of the differentiators between chrome and Safari was location of controls 
len ratingtwo Now I have to go to the bottom left for Chrome too 
len ratingtwo Ugh 
len ratingtwo Minus stars just for that 
len ratingone I love you Google I really do BUT WHY WOULD YOU REMAKE THE BEST BROWSER TO LOOK SIMILAR TO SAFARI 
len ratingone In case you weren t aware no one likes Safari and the reason why we download Chrome in the first place is because it WAS so much better 
len ratingone It takes longer to load up the app 
len ratingone I don t like all the tabs being out in the open 
len ratingone It s even harder to close tabs 
len ratingone The settings menu looks nice but everything else is just harder to get to since you actually have to read what it says 
len ratingone I don t like how easy it is to accidentally click on my history since it s on the first page 
len ratingone You should be able to choose what s on it 
len ratingthree Bring back the old layout
len ratingone Hate the new update 
len ratingone As others have said if I wanted to use Safari I would 
len ratingone I installed Google chrome which is now trying to be Safari only it is not as good at being Safari as Safari is 
len ratingone I will most likely be uninstalling Chrome 
len ratingone The new design is a safari copy 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I would 
len ratingone Please make it an option to use old style 
len ratingone Worse update I ve ever seen on any app 
len ratingone Please give us chrome back for now moving on to different browsers 
len ratingone Did you guys build this on windows shell 
len ratingfour Google I love ya but I was developing early onset s of carpel tunnel every time I needed the sub menu of previous version 
len ratingfour Everyday I thought safari I m coming back 
len ratingfour Thank you for the easy thumb navigation at the bottom of the screen 
len ratingfour In the nick of time 
len ratingfour I love this browser but the search button at the bottom is redundant to the dual use address bar at the top 
len ratingfour It would be great if we could set that button to search in page which is otherwise pretty hard to get to 
len ratingone I don t like the new user interface 
len ratingone I use chrome because I don t like safari s ui and now chrome uses almost the exact same one 
len ratingone If it doesn t change back I m switching to safari 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I wouldn t have downloaded Chrome 
len ratingone The new interface is terrible 
len ratingone Congrats on taking something that wasn t broken and screwing it up 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would 
len ratingone I used to love Chrome but the update is horrible 
len ratingone When I opened it I was confused and thought I was using Safari by accident 
len ratingone I can only hope that someone comes to their senses and changes it back 
len ratingone I hate the new update 
len ratingone I don t use safari for a reason and you guys just went and copied safari s terrible interface 
len ratingone I understand the desire to constantly improve but this update was not an improvement 
len ratingone The placement of everything has changed the back button is now at the bottom of the page who even thinks that s a good place 
len ratingone Oh yeah safari the tabs are in grid form and there are two different toolbars 
len ratingone I hate everything about it and I immediately researched how to remove an update from an app spoiler alert you can t 
len ratingone So I m stuck with it 
len ratingone Thanks Chrome Team I really appreciate it 
len ratingone I personally chose the google chrome app because I hated how Safari was set up and it was very similar to the desktop google chrome 
len ratingone I don t like the new update because it looks exactly like safari 
len ratingone I don t like the new bottom bar 
len ratingone One of many reasons why I preferred Chrome over Safari was that the controls were on the top 
len ratingone Now I have to change the habits I m used to using for quick navigation 
len ratingone Please stop trying to fix what s not broken 
len ratingone I really dislike the new look of the tabs 
len ratingone I personally prefer the old version of the tabs 
len ratingone I like the option of going between tabs by the numbers in the square at the top of the page vs the bottom of the page then it takes you to a screen with all your open tabs to choose from 
len ratingone I just like the old version best 
len ratingone Is there a way I can still get the old version 
len ratingone If so please respond 
len ratingone If not I m just going to use Safari 
len ratingone Opened the new version 
len ratingone Thought it was Safari 
len ratingone Why change what was already great 
len ratingone Please bring back the old ui 
len ratingone I ve loved Chrome for years but this update is the absolute worst 
len ratingone It s clunky awkward ugly inefficient and worst of all crashed within an hour of installing causing me to lose all of my open tabs 
len ratingone Please put it back the way it was 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingthree How about including a cast button for Google Chromecast in the future 
len ratingone I hate this new version of Chrome 
len ratingone it s way too much like Safari and I use Chrome specifically because I do not like the menus and features of Safari 
len ratingone please go back to being your own browser instead of a Safari wannabe 
len ratingone the last version of Chrome was perfect 
len ratingone I m all for innovation but not completely overhauling something that works great to begin with 
len ratingone The bottom toolbar doesn t bother me as much as some others but what ruins this for me is how I can t change tabs by swiping to the next one 
len ratingone And even more annoying is how you can t swipe to close the tabs 
len ratingone Obviously these are such first world problems but if I wanted a safari like browser I would have used safari 
len ratingone At least that s faster on an iPhone than Chrome 
len ratingone I loved chrome before this update but now it feels like safari
len ratingone I had to double check that I didn t drag safari back into my dock 
len ratingone Why why why would they replace a design specifically tailored to be better than safari 
len ratingone Where is documentation for changes 
len ratingone Forced update lost tab matrix for me 
len ratingone Where 
len ratingone Don t like the new app at all 
len ratingone Please rework it or go back to the old one 
len ratingone It was simple to use 
len ratingone This is confusing 
len ratingone Going to use Safari until it s fixed 
len ratingone Enough said 
len ratingtwo The new version really messed with my Mac 
len ratingtwo I had to mess around for a long time to figure out it had re set all my configurations like Flash and cookies 
len ratingtwo It would be so nice if it was more straightforward 
len ratingone As much as I love Chrome and it being my favorite browser I seriously loathe the new layout 
len ratingone It mirrors the Safari browser to a near T and I absolutely hate Safari 
len ratingone I really want the old layout back 
len ratingone When you have to open the app times after the upgrade because you think it s Safari and it s bad interface there s a problem 
len ratingone I understand the change is hard 
len ratingone Sometimes you have to push people to embrace a new layout or technology and you may lose some people in the process 
len ratingone I strongly dislike the new layout and UI chrome has adopted 
len ratingone It feels far less intuitive clunky and frankly less polished 
len ratingone I am disappointed that I cannot roll back to the earlier version 
len ratingone I guess I have to switch browsers 
len ratingtwo Please change it back 
len ratingtwo The top toolbar is WAY more usable than having to drop one hand to click while having to lift the screen with the other to get to the bottom 
len ratingtwo Plus when you change screens it automatically scroll to the top of your previous screen when you go back 
len ratingtwo That is extremely annoying when you re trying to read the news 
len ratingtwo Please change it back 
len ratingone Hate the new layout 
len ratingone I stick with Google Chrome because it s always been intuitive and similar in layout with each update 
len ratingone If I wanted to learn a new layout I would have downloaded a different browser 
len ratingone And very unmanageable 
len ratingone It looks like safari and I chose to use google chrome because I didn t like safari 
len ratingone Please roll back the UI or make the new one opt in 
len ratingone Why does it look exactly like safari I use chrome because I hate that design 
len ratingone Which is why I used Chrome now Chrome is a Safari clone I might as well use Safari
len ratingtwo You ve taken everything I really dislike about safari especially that bottom navigation bar made it bigger fatter and rounder and stuffed it into the browser I chose specifically to get away from all of that stuff in the first place 
len ratingtwo I ll be looking to see if there s a way to get the old version back and if there isn t which I suspect to be the case then it will be time to switch browsers 
len ratingtwo The reason why I used Chrome over Safari in the first place but now the new interface just seems like a knock off of Safari 
len ratingtwo The bottom toolbar and the top search bar take up too much space 
len ratingtwo The problem I originally had with Chrome is that the web address at the top of the page stayed for too long 
len ratingtwo I also liked the simplicity of having all the tab functions from the button that used to be there 
len ratingtwo At the very least it would be nice to have an optional revert but that s not possible on iOS 
len ratingtwo Not a fan of the new iOS update 
len ratingone If I wanted a safari looking browser I would have just kept the old Apple one 
len ratingone Why google why 
len ratingone NO NO NO 
len ratingone This design mimics safari and is AWFUL 
len ratingone Stick to being you google 
len ratingone The new bottom toolbar is horrible 
len ratingone For whose hands was Google designing 
len ratingone The top toolbar was sometimes a reach for a thumb but at least I could interact with Chrome one handed without fear of dropping my phone 
len ratingone The bottom toolbar is just awkward and forces me to use two hands 
len ratingone I hate the new tab grid as well 
len ratingone I preferred the stacked card layout 
len ratingone Granted this one is more subjective then the utility based argument of having controls in reach of ones thumb or not 
len ratingone I personally dislike this general trend towards tab grids 
len ratingone It s visually unattractive and slows me down in processing information 
len ratingone The only people I know who like tab grids are UX designers 
len ratingone Who are these apps being created for 
len ratingone Other UX designers 
len ratingone Or the user base as a whole 
len ratingone  Can t stand new update to my iOS chrome app also my autoupdate is turned off just for these reasons so I can wait and see if the updates have bugs yet somehow you bypassed my settings and updated anyways 
len ratingone Last week I was telling a friend who is a big iPhone Apple fan the reasons Chrome is better than Safari 
len ratingone Now you ve given me this awful update 
len ratingone Like so many others if I wanted to use Safari I d be using it 
len ratingone Along with everything else you took from Safari you TOOK AWAY the Add to Home Screen option which is what started the conversation with my friend 
len ratingone If I could this rating would be Stars 
len ratingone Bad update
len ratingone This new layout looks too much like Safari 
len ratingone There s a reason I used Chrome instead 
len ratingone If they both have the same ugly layout I might as well use Safari since it integrates better 
len ratingone Very disappointing 
len ratingone  Just got an absolutely terrible update forced out and I am very very unhappy 
len ratingone How do I either turn off this AWFUL way of showing and selecting tabs or revert to the previous version 
len ratingone I specifically use Chrome over Safari because I want the tabs on the top not in a screen of tiles 
len ratingone Not an improvement in any way at all but a change for the sake of change 
len ratingone The app was fine and looked fine 
len ratingone There needs to be a setting to show tabs the old way or a way to revert this whole mess 
len ratingone The light blue and white in the settings menu is also difficult to read and looks unprofessional 
len ratingone I hate this 
len ratingone This is the first time I m leaving a review for an app just to say this new update is awful 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone At this point if it continues to look this way then I ll have to switch to Safari 
len ratingtwo  The new update is visually unappealing and looks like some horrible combination of the worst parts of Safari and the Firefox mobile app 
len ratingtwo That s not my only complaint of course 
len ratingtwo I liked Chrome before the update because of how it resembled the desktop browser while also being a functional mobile app and how the url bar would hide as I scrolled 
len ratingtwo Now it does neither of these things and just looks really bad 
len ratingtwo The control panel at the bottom leads to sore thumbs and having the controls separate from the url bar just looks sloppy 
len ratingtwo It s too hard to close tabs that tiny X is difficult to select if you have wide fingers or if fine motor function is difficult for you 
len ratingtwo I only even updated because Chrome kept crashing when I tried to use it 
len ratingtwo I d expect that kind of BS from Apple sure but now Google 
len ratingtwo Shame on you 
len ratingtwo I ve just downloaded Firefox I have my issues there as well but it s still better than your new crap sorry app Get your act together and listen to user feedback or that s where I and my friends will be going 
len ratingthree This new update is awful take me back to the last version switching tabs is ugly
len ratingone Absolute from what I m used to and I don t enjoy the new look whatsoever 
len ratingone  I had to do a double take 
len ratingone The new layout is practically safari and if I had wanted safari I wouldn t have downloaded google chrome 
len ratingone I don t like that I can t swipe to close tabs anymore 
len ratingone At this point you ve got a safari interface with worse features 
len ratingone Please PLEASE revert back 
len ratingone We will pretend like this whole thing never happened
len ratingfive I used safari for YEARS and always hated it 
len ratingfive I decided to download google chrome and my god I LOVE IT 
len ratingfive So easy so fast AND it makes searching a BREEZE 
len ratingfive Do yourself a favor and ditch whatever crappy internet app your using and enjoy the simplicity of google chrome you won t be disappointed 
len ratingone The whole point of me using chrome was because I hated the safari UI 
len ratingone Change it back 
len ratingone This update is gross 
len ratingone All the things I loved about Chrome over Safari are gone 
len ratingone Please switch back to the old layout 
len ratingone This is awful 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone I believe we had the same layout for at least the past five years I m so excited that it s been entirely changed and redesigned 
len ratingone I guess the phrase don t fix what isn t broken really exists for no reason 
len ratingone Learning new muscle memory for literally no reason isn t a huge inconvenience at all 
len ratingone The new UI is too minimalistic and looks like safari 
len ratingone The reason I used chrome on IOS is it looked more like a traditional browser and I don t like safari 
len ratingtwo Everything in this app had been all good till just recently 
len ratingtwo I believe I downloaded Google Chrome not Mozilla Firefox or Safari 
len ratingtwo Maybe there s an option to put my toolbar back up top where it belongs that I haven t seen yet 
len ratingtwo I ve checked options but there wasn t anything there 
len ratingtwo Please at least add the option to move the toolbar up top
len ratingone hate 
len ratingone changing to a different browser 
len ratingone This new design Is awful just plain ugly 
len ratingone Give us a warning next time 
len ratingone It looks like a browser for a cheap kids tablet
len ratingfive I really loved the new update and how sleek the entire thing looks 
len ratingfive However I recently opened up the app and its reverted back to its old design 
len ratingfive A shame I really did enjoy the new one 
len ratingfive I was wondering if I could get that back 
len ratingone Why would you ruin the best browser 
len ratingone Chrome was perfect before 
len ratingone I hated Safari and now you have ruined Chrome 
len ratingone Please don t change on Android phones too 
len ratingone Its all I have left 
len ratingone The new update looks and feels like Safari 
len ratingone I use Chrome because I have always preferred its top down interface over Safari 
len ratingone Now I can t even tell the difference 
len ratingone I want my old chrome back 
len ratingfive  Good job Google after years and years of using Safari the latest Chrome update made me replace the native iOS browser 
len ratingone Why does chrome look like a bad rip off version of safari now 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone I didn t even know about the update and just clicked my chrome app not thinking any drastic changes were to await me 
len ratingone And I just absolutely do not like the new design I think that layout format should be optional and not forced upon users 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingthree  I get the logic behind moving buttons towards the bottom of the screen for ease of reach 
len ratingthree I didn t necessarily need it but I understand the reasoning 
len ratingthree But I have to echo what many others are saying by asking why make everything else so much like Safari 
len ratingthree If I wanted to use Safari I d be using Safari 
len ratingfour Plz add dark theme for non incognito mode
len ratingone This new update is ridiculous I m about to uninstall after like years of loyalty 
len ratingone Why redesign your interface to mimic safari 
len ratingone Those of us who use chrome are literally blatantly trying to avoid that 
len ratingone Whichever google employee s that thought this was a good idea needs to be fired because this is a travesty 
len ratingone Now there s no point in resisting the switch over to safari 
len ratingfive  The redesign is great thank you 
len ratingtwo Have been using Chrome as an alternative to Safari because I disliked the Safari layout 
len ratingtwo Now Chrome is exactly the same 
len ratingtwo Why use Chrome 
len ratingone This update will have me using safari until I have to option to use the old layout
len ratingtwo This version is a pain to use too much like Safari which I can t stand either 
len ratingtwo I really wish you would have left things alone 
len ratingtwo The new design is much harder to use 
len ratingtwo All the buttons I want to press are at the bottom of the screen so I need to awkwardly try to fold my thumb down to hit them 
len ratingtwo The search text is to large compared to everything else 
len ratingtwo If you type anything longer than a word long the suggestions will go offscreen 
len ratingtwo The tabs panel makes all the tabs to small to see what is going on in them 
len ratingtwo I think that I will go back to using safari until chrome gets fixed 
len ratingone The new setup with the latest update is terrible might as well just use safari with their stupid little arrows in the bottom left corner
len ratingfive I don t usually review things but they just updated chrome and I love the layout and the usability and speed so much 
len ratingfive Truly top notch and miles ahead of any other mobile web browser 
len ratingone  Seriously awful 
len ratingone The old UI worked great 
len ratingone Should at least be an option to use tab view or the normal stacked view 
len ratingone The new redesign update is horrible please bring back the old google 
len ratingone For the love of god please go back to the old design 
len ratingone This is the dumbest idea I ve ever seen why in the world would you move everything from top to bottom 
len ratingone What is the point 
len ratingone Everybody is accustomed to it being on the top and it actually looked better before too 
len ratingone This update is horrendous don t even want to use chrome anymore 
len ratingone The newest update had changed the layout of EVERYTHING 
len ratingone It s not user friendly and requires so many taps that are not needed or wanted 
len ratingone Get Dolphin instead guys 
len ratingone Why change what was just fine 
len ratingone You wouldn t take my password so I came up with a new one 
len ratingone Just disgusted I had all the things I regularly used gone thanks for the headache 
len ratingtwo HATE the update 
len ratingtwo Where is the save image and the home page Icon 
len ratingtwo I Do NOT like the tabs at the bottom of the page or that I have to go to the App store to access the Google Chrome application As a long term user of Google Chrome and other Google applications I am seriously saddened that users have fewer choices and options 
len ratingtwo Please give us the Google Chrome icon back and the save images to gallery 
len ratingone New layout is terrible 
len ratingone It s horrible it s similar to safari and it s unsatisfactory go back to the last version please
len ratingone New UI is pretty ugly and the grey blends in too much 
len ratingone I like the new tab features but the design is terrible 
len ratingone I literally hate everything about it 
len ratingone Just let me use an older version please 
len ratingone The new update is painfully ugly 
len ratingone The last design was perfectly fine and easy to navigate 
len ratingone It existed for years why change it now 
len ratingone Please revert 
len ratingtwo I ll admit I use google chrome over safari any day 
len ratingtwo But the new UI looks absolutely atrocious 
len ratingtwo Having the toolbar at the bottom makes it much more annoying when scrolling down on a page and hitting the stupid search button instead 
len ratingtwo Also the new bubbly design while it s mediocre it s just childish 
len ratingtwo Who s ever idea it was to redesign something that wasn t broken really needs this job to be reworked and fired 
len ratingfour Great browser I can have all of bookmarks not just in my computer but on my phone although I feel is missing the dark mode option just like the Youtube has if they add that functionality it will look even better
len ratingone Going to delete this app 
len ratingone Horrible update change it back to the old layout the reason I use chrome not safari
len ratingone Old UI was intuitive clean cute and true to the Google type of uniqueness 
len ratingone When I clicked a link for the first time today I initially thought that my phone had updated while I was asleep because Chrome now looks like a bulky reskinned Safari 
len ratingone It isn t even pretty enough to warrant it 
len ratingone I used Chrome for years thankful for the lovely layout that really never mimicked Safari 
len ratingone Won t bother to relearn an app that didn t need fixing 
len ratingone Never using Chrome again on iPhone going to Cake or Firefox 
len ratingone Loved chrome but since the update the new ui is horrible 
len ratingone Reminds me of safari that s why I switched to chrome in the first place 
len ratingone Disappointing hope they add a feature to revert to old ui 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari s interface I would 
len ratingone Please bring back the old interface an option to disable to update 
len ratingone New layout looks like Safari 
len ratingone I downloaded google because I don t like Safari 
len ratingone Also there is bug 
len ratingone Chrome freezes after I enter URL
len ratingone Not everyone has a monster iPhone Plus screen with the real estate for huge and unnecessary nav bars 
len ratingone I don t need or want the domain name wasting precious space 
len ratingone Everything looks cluttered and is much harder to use coming from a long time chrome user 
len ratingone Switching browsers asap unless redesign reverts or becomes optional 
len ratingone  if I wanted to use safari I wouldn t have downloaded chrome 
len ratingone The bottom toolbar is inconvenient and ergonomically inefficient 
len ratingone Please reinstate the top toolbar
len ratingfive I personally love this app so much because I have a school computer that we keep the whole year 
len ratingfive And since almost all of the chrome web store apps are blocked or unavailable I can synce my account to my iPad and download them on the iPad and then sync it so then I get the apps I wanted to get but couldn t get 
len ratingfive This is the best of the best of the best as I said up right next to my second favorite Microsoft internet explorer 
len ratingfive So that is what I think of google chrome 
len ratingfive I highly suggest that you get the app it s really easy to use and it s free just like other apps
len ratingone Its awful change it back i thought i was using safari when i opened it and was really confused because I used chrome because I hate safari s interface
len ratingtwo The new ui is bad 
len ratingtwo Just bad 
len ratingtwo They literally copied the overlay of safari and called it a day 
len ratingtwo It is not good just clunky 
len ratingtwo Functionality might be the same but the new layout is terrible 
len ratingtwo Top controls are much more intuitive 
len ratingtwo At least an option to use a classic mode should be available 
len ratingone I absolutely love Google Chrome but this new update is horrible from a design and aesthetics standpoint 
len ratingone I don t want to open Chrome on my iPhone at all 
len ratingone The new redesign is awful and is much harder to use over the previous design it feels clunky like Safari which is why I use the Chrome anyways 
len ratingone At this point I might just move over to another browser if this isn t at the very least reconsidered or it is possible to change back via a setting 
len ratingfive This new update is really nice 
len ratingfive Layout and all 
len ratingone Used to love chrome had a great familiar feel ran smooth and great 
len ratingone I really appreciated the layout and how it was different from safari 
len ratingone With the new update it feels just like safari which is a far more convenient app to use on iOS since you cannot change default browser 
len ratingone So if chrome is going to be the same as safari why should I use chrome 
len ratingone Pointless 
len ratingone Go back to the old layout 
len ratingfive Smart improvements 
len ratingone  I understand change is inevitable but not to this extent please 
len ratingone I like it better when I had multiple tabs open I could just slide the tab to the right to close it 
len ratingone The new process is worse 
len ratingone Wow 
len ratingone So you make an alternative to the crapfest that is Safari and you decide to update it to look and feel like Safari 
len ratingone Derp 
len ratingfive New update looks like it came from andriod 
len ratingone  The new update is horrible 
len ratingone Makes it much more difficult to use then previously
len ratingone The new update looks and operates just like Safari 
len ratingone I use Chrome to get away from Safari 
len ratingone WHY 
len ratingone The previous iterations were SOO much better
len ratingtwo Why did you change chrome to not be like it is on desktop 
len ratingtwo The whole reason I used it was to have the same ui 
len ratingfive It is very efficient and the new design is much better
len ratingone oh dear lord please change it back
len ratingone  I loved when the tabs were on the top and mobile chrome had the exact same layout as chrome on my laptop 
len ratingone Now it is very similar to Safari which I ve never liked to use because of its layout 
len ratingone I wish I could get the old chrome layout back 
len ratingone You updated something that was completely fine to make it bad 
len ratingone Please change it back I beg of you 
len ratingfive I really like the new update 
len ratingfive Very clean and stylish 
len ratingtwo If I wanted a browser to look like Safari I d use Safari 
len ratingtwo There wasn t anything wrong with the previous version so I m not sure why someone thought it needed to be changed 
len ratingone Too much like safari 
len ratingone I want my back button at the top left corner 
len ratingfive The new layout of tabs are convenient 
len ratingfive Still exploring the release 
len ratingone if i wanted to use safari i would 
len ratingone i use chrome to get away from the confusing set up and ugly bottom bar 
len ratingone either give an option to go back to the old setup or drop this update 
len ratingone no one likes it and it looks like it s years old 
len ratingone I am very unpleased with this app 
len ratingone I hate how it how it freezes when I type a website then it crashes Chrome didn t shut down correctly 
len ratingone I close the app from my phone then reopen it and same issue it freezes then crashes 
len ratingone I m so very frustrated with this app and disappointed 
len ratingone This latest update that changes the layout just makes it more like the safari browser 
len ratingone I used chrome because I don t like safari s layout 
len ratingone Now there s no point in having this app 
len ratingfive The update is super sleek 
len ratingfive Well done Google 
len ratingtwo I ve been using chrome for at least a year now and I loved it 
len ratingtwo It was fast practical and familiar 
len ratingtwo With the new UI update it s lost all three of those attributes 
len ratingtwo I understand that some people may like the new UI and I don t blame them 
len ratingtwo It looks nice but some people are dissatisfied 
len ratingtwo I suggest an option to use the old UI sort of a Classic Mode 
len ratingtwo This may bring the reviews back up 
len ratingtwo  HATE the update 
len ratingtwo Where is the home page Icon 
len ratingtwo I Do NOT like the tabs at the bottom of the page 
len ratingtwo I like the older systems better 
len ratingtwo Sad users have fewer choices and options 
len ratingone It s ugly now
len ratingone Me encantaba Chrome hasta que hicieron este nuevo dise o 
len ratingone Se parece a Safari so si lo quisiera as mejor usaba Safari y nunca lo quise usar 
len ratingone Ahora estoy buscando otro browser gracias a su parecido con Safari en el nuevo dise o que no me gusta para nada 
len ratingone I hate the new design it s confusing and hard to use 
len ratingone It also looks like safari and looks like it has been years old 
len ratingone The reason I started to use chrome and ditched Safari was because it was easy to use and because of the format 
len ratingone Anyways it is helpful in the older version 
len ratingone At least i can still search up stuff 
len ratingone The new update makes it look just like safari 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I wouldn t have downloaded google chrome 
len ratingone This update it terrible 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone Why did you change the UI this much 
len ratingone I didn t have any issues with the current UI 
len ratingone It has been my go to browser and now I will use it long enough to find something else 
len ratingone All the rounded corners and overall looks too amateur as if this while UI seas created by grade school kids 
len ratingone I have always lied you can search then flip between images maps shopping all easy 
len ratingone Developers do NOT always know what users want 
len ratingone Remember that 
len ratingone Use your focuses groups use your feedback loops ask your users what they want 
len ratingone I never used Safari because I didn t like it now I have versions of Safari 
len ratingone Wow 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingtwo This newest update looks ridiculous 
len ratingtwo It looks like a Safari imitation which is annoying because I use Chrome because I don t like Safari 
len ratingtwo This redesign looks immature and is far too similar to Safari to find any significant difference 
len ratingone I ve been using chrome for years and I loved having the toolbar at the top 
len ratingone I didn t use the safari app because the toolbar was at the bottom now what s stoping me from going to them 
len ratingone That s what the default is on my phone and what opens whenever I get pulled to the browser
len ratingone Please change it back I like the old design better 
len ratingtwo Moving all the features from the top of the screen to the bottom is jarring and hard to get used to 
len ratingtwo The keyboard covers those same options meaning an extra step closing keyboard when having to move tabs or whatever 
len ratingtwo Wish I could revert to the previous version 
len ratingtwo I love this chrome browser on my iPhone I hate Safari this latest update made everything Like safari put everything back where it was 
len ratingtwo Like it is on my android phone
len ratingtwo If I wanted a safari interface I would be using Safari as a browser 
len ratingtwo I see no reason to have chrome if it s the same as Safari 
len ratingone We should be given the option to change back to the old layout if desired 
len ratingone Chrome has always been my favorite browser but this new update has me looking for a new one 
len ratingone If they do not update so we have options for the layout I will have to change 
len ratingone It s a headache and not smooth and easy to use 
len ratingtwo I have an iPhone but I don t like the browers that comes with it so I downloaded goolge chrome now please tell me why I open the app after the update and it s just Safari
len ratingone Update is too much bs 
len ratingone Moving the controls to the bottom helped ergonomics by sacrificing accidentally hitting those buttons all the time 
len ratingone They really didn t think through why it was setup the other way originally 
len ratingthree  This would be a star app but the new update that makes it look and feel like safari makes it completely lacking in every aspect that users love and want to use Chrome 
len ratingone The new ui is miserable 
len ratingone Not compatible with websites I ve used with the previous version of chrome
len ratingone why change something that didnt need fixing 
len ratingone the new update is hideous and is a nuisance to use 
len ratingone yikes
len ratingtwo Google Chrome on iPhone looks and feels like Safari which are two primary reasons I did not use Safari
len ratingone New update is awful I avoid using Safari because of its terrible design 
len ratingone This redesign just feels like Safari 
len ratingone I also really dislike the rounded edges on everything now 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingfive Occasionally safari won t show something properly or won t respond to a button press 
len ratingfive Chrome has been less buggy even with the Apple website which did not load the iPhone XS preorder page properly 
len ratingfive I tried opening it in chrome and it worked just fine 
len ratingfive Same thing with the Razer Blade website button presses responded more often 
len ratingfive Safari loaded something that chrome didn t only once which was the Samsung Galaxy website 
len ratingfive Also safari doesn t sync with my PC which Chrome does so that s a plus 
len ratingfive It also has a smarter layout and the new update makes it look better than ever 
len ratingone Chrome was fine until quite literally this morning 
len ratingone Now they ve reworked it to match the bloated new web suite they re forcing on everyone 
len ratingone Gone is the ability to tell at a glance if you ve bookmarked a page 
len ratingone Gone is the ability to bookmark with a single click you now have to dig through the tab menu a feature they have the stones to tout as convenient 
len ratingone The controls are now at the bottom of the page right where you ll hit them a lot with your finger when scrolling 
len ratingfive Thanks for moving the buttons to the bottom 
len ratingfive UI is also way better and it seems much faster 
len ratingfive Good job 
len ratingone So this new update is awful 
len ratingone Everything feels like a big bubble and looks like mobile Safari which I hate 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I wouldn t have downloaded chrome 
len ratingone Everything I love about the Chrome mobile and desktop on mobile version is gone 
len ratingone This feels like a mobile browser an outdated one and makes me not want to use it all 
len ratingone It s awkward the design has a very childish or aged feel to it like we went backwards several versions and several years 
len ratingone It is so bad that it almost feels like a console where Google is trying to make us hate the iPhone versions of their apps so we have to switch to their devices 
len ratingone I m normally one who doesn t care so much about app design changes and I give myself time to get used to it 
len ratingone This is just so poorly done I don t want to use Chrome at all 
len ratingone And that s a big deal for me 
len ratingone I use Chrome for everything 
len ratingone Time to look for a better browser experience I guess 
len ratingone  New UI Very safari like in layout 
len ratingone Runs counter to what people are accustomed to when using various versions of Chrome 
len ratingone Using the prior version was very intuitive if coming from a desktop version of Chrome or even Firefox 
len ratingone This one isn t 
len ratingone The new tab picker is now worse than Safari s 
len ratingone I don t want to scroll through a photo album layout of all my tabs 
len ratingone The pictures are small enough to be useless if the shown page is largely text based like Wikipedia 
len ratingone Barely any of the page title can be shown now because the tiles are small 
len ratingone At least Safari shows enough of the title and a bit of the page in a large enough image to clearly tell what you re looking at 
len ratingone The prior chrome tab picker was wonderful in how it displayed the cards in a manner very easily scrolled through 
len ratingone I needed only scroll and and move my eyes slightly up or down to find then read the title of each tab 
len ratingone With this new version you have to look up and down and left and right to track and find each tab title then read the tiny bit of title available 
len ratingone I will concede the the new UI might be mildly prettier 
len ratingone However the clean compact easily functional design of the previous UI made it beautiful 
len ratingone I thought I was on safari when i opened up chrome 
len ratingone There was no need for a complete overhaul 
len ratingone There should really be an option to keep the old interface 
len ratingone I will put stars once there is that option 
len ratingone Otherwise these stars will pile up 
len ratingtwo Please allow a full screen experience again 
len ratingtwo I extremely dislike the clock bar and web address name at the top 
len ratingtwo This was the only reason i used chrome on the ipad and iphone 
len ratingone  Change it back to the original version 
len ratingone Tabs should be on the upper right 
len ratingone When I want to change tabs I shouldn t see all of them 
len ratingone The search and back tabs should be on the top 
len ratingfive I have always had chrome on my phone but I preferred safari because it had a better interface 
len ratingfive Which the new update I m never using safari again 
len ratingtwo The new update looks like the preschool version of safari 
len ratingtwo Still seems to work great but I much preferred the style and locations of controls the way they were
len ratingthree Can no longer close keyboards when typing in a username field 
len ratingone The most recent update has pretty much turned Chrome into a Safari Clone 
len ratingone The reason I have Chrome installed in the first place is that I can t stand Safari s UI 
len ratingone I ll be switching to Firefox now 
len ratingfive  Please activate the video resolution gear when browsing YouTube from iphones 
len ratingfive Most recent update looks and feels great in my opinion 
len ratingtwo I have used chrome as my primary iOS browser in great part due to the address bar and tab list being at the top with the bookmark star right in that space 
len ratingtwo This was also a distinguishing trait setting chrome apart from other less useful browsers such as Safari 
len ratingtwo Killed two great features with one update 
len ratingtwo Why 
len ratingtwo I can t agree with the logic of swiping down to see an address bar and then having to search at the bottom of the screen to access the other open tabs 
len ratingtwo If I want to bookmark a page now it is clicks rather than Not helpful 
len ratingtwo I also much preferred the stacked tabs list view from previous versions 
len ratingtwo Huge disappointment 
len ratingone Terrible update 
len ratingone Goodbye going to install Brave now 
len ratingfour However the only change I would like to see is a type of gesture within the tabs to close them it s annoying having to hit the tiny x in the corner I wish we could slide the tabs up when we want to close them 
len ratingfour That s my only recommendation thank you 
len ratingthree I don t know why the interface has changed but I do not like it 
len ratingthree The tabs are too hard to close and the screen is too round or bubbled 
len ratingthree I guess it will take some getting used to 
len ratingthree I think it was fine the way it was 
len ratingone So disappointed with this update 
len ratingone It s confusing and counterintuitive 
len ratingone As a long time user I ve always enjoyed Chrome s sleek but user friendly design interface 
len ratingone This update makes the hub cumbersome and clunky sacrificing function for form 
len ratingone Unfortunately I imagine I ll just have to endure it until my brain gives over to Stockholm Syndrome as there s no amount of user feedback or reviews that will do any good to have this fixed as is so often the case in these situations 
len ratingone Expected more got less 
len ratingone Story of our lives 
len ratingone This update is garbage 
len ratingone The very reason I downloaded Chrome in the first place was because I don t care for Safari on the iPhone 
len ratingone Please change it back or give an option to toggle between layouts 
len ratingone This new version is absolutely awful 
len ratingone Everything I used chrome over safari for is gone 
len ratingone No more gestures to remove tabs an absolute hideous layout for switching between tabs and the bar moved to the bottom where it is entirely inconvenient 
len ratingone I want my old chrome back because this new version is terrible 
len ratingone If I wanted a browser like this I would use safari 
len ratingone I used chrome because it was better but all that is gone now replaced with a crappier uglier less user friendly version 
len ratingone The reason I use this app is because it felt so much better to use than safari 
len ratingone That has changed with this update 
len ratingone Now it feels exactly the same as safari 
len ratingone I m all for change but this was unnecessary 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would not have downloaded the chrome app 
len ratingone Can t see the bottom of the page drop downs don t work all the time everything is at the bottom tabs are arranged weird 
len ratingone It is if a drugged out Elon Musk has resigned everything 
len ratingthree Over the past two weeks my Chrome app on iOS has been freezing and then crashing when it tries to start 
len ratingthree I have applied all OS and app updates 
len ratingone Loyal Chrome user for years mainly because I can t stand Safari 
len ratingone This update makes it looks like Safari I thought I was in the wrong app initially 
len ratingone Hate it go back to previous UI please
len ratingone With this new layout I hate it 
len ratingone Google at least give users an option to toggle between the old and new layout c mon it s 
len ratingthree I downloaded chrome because I don t like browsing with safari 
len ratingone  Is there a way to change it back to the old interface 
len ratingone I hate how it looks exactly like safari 
len ratingone Please change it back
len ratingone In your app front page advertising you highlight your gross oversight for quality by using poor English more simple 
len ratingone Is that Indian English 
len ratingone Used chrome for years because I hate other designs 
len ratingone Now this last update is ugly and makes things harder 
len ratingone If I wanted a Safari looking app I d use Safari 
len ratingfour I didn t even know it happened 
len ratingfour I opened chrome and got very confused 
len ratingfour I liked it and hoped it was an update and not just some glitch 
len ratingfour Lol So far I m impressed with the look just have to keep playing around with it so I can see all that s new with it 
len ratingone Woke up to the new version AWFUL 
len ratingone PLEASE REVERT 
len ratingthree  Seriously 
len ratingthree The recent update changed the entire UI it is hardly recognizable as the Chrome 
len ratingthree Now it feels like another Safari and the design looks years old 
len ratingthree Why 
len ratingtwo It s Safari ish look is the user unfriendly reason that I didn t use Safari 
len ratingtwo It is now the reason I no longer enjoy using Chrome 
len ratingone The UI is horrible 
len ratingone The magnifying glass at the bottom is completely unnecessary when I could press the top URL bar 
len ratingtwo The new update looks terrible 
len ratingtwo The updated layout looks and feels like Safari which is exactly what I want to avoid 
len ratingfive Love this new look 
len ratingfive Way more practical and has alot more helpful ways of organizing your tabs 
len ratingfive Great work Google 
len ratingone Looks like Safari 
len ratingone I chose Chrome to get away from Safari
len ratingone New update came I had some things I had googled in incognito and later on forgot and let the tab there and went and opened a regular tab 
len ratingone A bit of a time later I went to show someone my research on the regular tab and instead it loaded the app with the incognito tab loaded embarrassing 
len ratingone Trash 
len ratingone Why would you close on a regular tab then come back to open on a incognito one its like you want us to be exposed 
len ratingone The new interface is hard to use 
len ratingfive I thought this was safari when I opened it so I kept exiting out of the app and reloading it until I realized it updated 
len ratingone I used to like this because of the interface being more similar to a desktop browser 
len ratingone Newest update made it exactly like safari good job you big fat idiots
len ratingtwo  I love using this app but the update has completely threw me off 
len ratingtwo I often use google and when I m scrolling down my fingers are always on the bottom of the screen and swiping things all the time 
len ratingtwo I read a lot and the new google update isn t helping 
len ratingtwo I prefer the old version where everything is on top of the screen where I can easily swipe up to hide and not accidentally click a button to go back or forth when I don t need to 
len ratingtwo I just want to know if there s anyway to downgrade the app 
len ratingtwo I also had over tabs open 
len ratingtwo I lost it all in an instant and have NO way of getting them back 
len ratingtwo I haven t the slightest clue what majority of the tabs were called and it s extremely difficult to try to find EVERYTHING all over again which I don t have time for 
len ratingone What a hell is wrong with you Google 
len ratingone One star
len ratingone This update brought a complete redesign to the app and I m not at all a fan 
len ratingone You dumbed down the app interface with big in your face icons 
len ratingone Now it looks like another apple app that wasn t well thought out 
len ratingone It s childish and unintuitive to use 
len ratingone Bring back the old chrome 
len ratingone When will you remove that very ugly black bar on top 
len ratingone Make it grey whitish 
len ratingone Was thrown when I opened this for the first time post update 
len ratingone Use chrome religiously on desktop Mac PC and mobile both Android and iOS phones 
len ratingone This latest redesign visually looks a lot like Safari and functionally it s not ideal for one handed use 
len ratingone TLDR having two identical browsers on one phone seems redundant in storage 
len ratingone Will go back to Safari 
len ratingone Looks and works way worse than the previous version 
len ratingone Safari works better now than this trash 
len ratingfour Great but sometimes google crashes 
len ratingfour Also take ads away
len ratingone Won t be updating to this new nonsense 
len ratingone Looks like safari and safari is garbage
len ratingone Newest update makes the user interface exactly like safari which was the whole reason I didn t use safari in the first place 
len ratingone I d like to revert to the old version that retains tabs and menu on the top of the browser vs having it all at the bottom 
len ratingfive Wow 
len ratingfive I am very satisfied with this new updated look of Chrome 
len ratingfive It works really well looks beautiful with this modern look and is quicker than the pervious versions 
len ratingfive This update is magnificent really 
len ratingfive  stars rating 
len ratingfive  From an iPad user
len ratingone This new update looks just like safari and I hate it 
len ratingone The main reason I used chrome over safari was the UI 
len ratingone Is there an option to go back to the old interface that I m missing 
len ratingone This new update reminds me exactly of safari 
len ratingone The main reason I used chrome to begin with was because of the better design 
len ratingone Please give us and option to switch between the old interface and new one that would truly be awesome 
len ratingfive The new look is clean and the app is faster on my iPhone SE 
len ratingfive Good job Google 
len ratingone I have always used chrome becuase i hated safari and now google has changed it to mimic safari 
len ratingtwo I used to love Chrome but I got a newer phone and everything has changed 
len ratingtwo Tabs used to be at top but now everything is at the bottom 
len ratingtwo I don t like it 
len ratingtwo Why would you switch stuff like that 
len ratingthree Icons all are kind of clunky and look like they were dug up from some device from yrs ago 
len ratingthree Google needs to update the icons to be inline with iOS and not android 
len ratingthree Improvement is device connection is a bit better 
len ratingthree Just the cc that is 
len ratingone Latest update is trash 
len ratingone Less intuitive layout than previous build 
len ratingone  Much of the revised organization is helpful but it looks like it was made for year olds same with the desktop version 
len ratingone The update is worse than safari 
len ratingone UI redesign makes a lot of intuitive touch screen gesture gone 
len ratingone Swipe to close tab which is able to do in safari is gone 
len ratingone Must aim and tap at the small X button to close tab which is ridiculous 
len ratingfive It s much more convenient when you add a new tab it goes instantly now instead of what it did before the people complaint how it looks like safari are idiots who don t know what they re talking about and are people who can t handle change 
len ratingfive This app is way better and faster now 
len ratingthree Been very happy with Chrome for years but the update that added the bottom screen navigation is really annoying 
len ratingthree Scrolling around now often results in not being able to see the bottom of a webpage and is much more intrusive then the older versions 
len ratingfive Love the new update 
len ratingthree I like how this update looks but it s not functional 
len ratingthree Everything is loading SOOOO much slower than usual or not loading at 
len ratingthree I ve been having to use the dreaded safari all day I miss my Chrome 
len ratingone I loved chrome before the new update 
len ratingone Why fix something that wasn t broken 
len ratingone I liken chrome because of the back and firmware buttons on the top I hate them on the bottom 
len ratingone It looks and feels just like safari which I don t like 
len ratingone Put he back and forward buttons back on top and I ll be able to live with all the other changes 
len ratingthree People use the top text bar all the time for things other than URLs I would say of the time I use it to search 
len ratingthree There s no autocorrect enabled in that field and it drives everyone mad 
len ratingthree Plus the period character is in a weird spot so popular google searches always look like this in the autocomplete fields 
len ratingthree Please fix it 
len ratingthree Everything else is good 
len ratingfive You can now reorganize tabs 
len ratingfive Also I like he new look 
len ratingone Chrome was the only browser is used on my iPhone until the latest update 
len ratingone If I wanted a browser that looked like safari I d just use safari 
len ratingone Terrible look and functionality and so slow it s basically unusable now 
len ratingone What was google thinking 
len ratingone I like most people despise Safari and like most people switched to Google Chrome 
len ratingone As an avid Chrome user I woke up today to the horror that my browser had been converted to the browser that I hate the most 
len ratingone It s so bad that I felt compelled to download Firefox in hopes that it mimicked the Chrome I grew to love 
len ratingone On its th anniversary this just isn t what it deserves to commemorate such a special occasion 
len ratingone If you re reading this and actually have the power to do something about it please listen to the numerous complaints that are really just cries for compromise 
len ratingone I m sure the app developer did their best it looks good but it s not Chrome 
len ratingone It s a better Safari 
len ratingone Instead can we be better than Safari 
len ratingfive i think the redesign looks really nice 
len ratingfive it d be cool though if when going to open a new tab you could just tap in the blank space to open one instead of needing to tap on the plus
len ratingone Safari I don t like it 
len ratingone I am just not used to it thats why I use Google 
len ratingone Google is fast Google was simple Google was organized NOW WHAT THE HECKEROO IS THIS UPDATE 
len ratingone Why would we need the search at the bottom 
len ratingone Why is it so complicated 
len ratingone Why are the tools at the bottom 
len ratingone IT LOOKS LIKE SAFARI 
len ratingone I wish I could go back to the last update 
len ratingone The last udate had nothing bad about it 
len ratingone Chrome user from the start but the the direction taken with the new UI seems lazy
len ratingone New UI looks awful 
len ratingone It looks like the Comic Sans of app UI it is a giant cartoony mess 
len ratingone Really disappointing 
len ratingone I ve been using Chrome for years because safari is garbage but with this new update 
len ratingone I might as well just use Safari 
len ratingone I m not sure what made Chrome want to use the same UI but having the buttons on the bottom of the page is inconvenient and takes up space and isn t intuitive at all 
len ratingone The tabs page is basic and unappealing 
len ratingone Please bring back the old UI 
len ratingthree  I ve used Chrome religiously for a while now pretty much since I ve started on the iPhone trend with the 
len ratingthree and I ve usually had a good experience with it 
len ratingthree However I m not sure I m completely sold on the new stuff 
len ratingthree The bigger tabs are fine it s a bit easier to see what s going on in each but the bottom bar is just odd 
len ratingthree It looks like safari now and that s an issue because safari looks dated 
len ratingthree Sure it s easier to reach but I feel like it s taking up more screen space now instead of me having lots of room to maneuver or bring up the control panel by swiping up 
len ratingthree If I had to suggest a change I d say that you should have a option to have the old screen type back 
len ratingthree Other than that I m happy to see that the app has really kept what works and improved on things that aren t exactly doing the trick anymore 
len ratingthree The consistency of the app is probably the thing I love the most something companies don t seem to get APPLE bring back the button APPLE 
len ratingthree Great app for everyday use with minimal to no glitching 
len ratingthree Thanks google 
len ratingone Have always used it because I do not like Safari 
len ratingone With the new update I double checked twice because I thought I was using Safari 
len ratingone Hate it so I m just going to unistall and use Safari 
len ratingfive Really loving the new design 
len ratingthree I like the functional changes with this redesign but the aesthetic changes are barf city 
len ratingthree The bezels which I know isn t the right terminology the search bar at the top and the bar at the bottom are gigantic and never minimize even a little 
len ratingthree I like the idea of the bottom one staying in position but can I at least have an option to make it a lot smaller 
len ratingthree That brings me to another point albeit less important I d really like some type of customization 
len ratingthree Font size color scheme something 
len ratingthree TLDR it s aight but should be a lot better for a full redesign especially from Google 
len ratingone There was a reason I was using Chrome and not Safari 
len ratingone I hate the new look 
len ratingone I hope I ll be able to switch back to original look 
len ratingone  Version made me uninstall Chrome and now I m back at Safari 
len ratingone Google please fire your entire design team 
len ratingtwo Very bad 
len ratingtwo I have an IPhone X Now that you moved the back and forward as well the menu down im losing so much space 
len ratingtwo Bring it back up please and it would be great if all could be black or dark gray
len ratingtwo It says that they moved all of the buttons so everything would be co located but when when you want to switch to a different tab you still have to move your thumb all the way up to the top of the screen 
len ratingtwo Old interface was much better 
len ratingtwo Going to try out other browsers now 
len ratingone Put the toolbar back on top or at least make it an option 
len ratingone Looking at alternative web browsers in the meantime 
len ratingone I used to like Google Chrome over any other mobile browser 
len ratingone This new updated app makes it no better or any different than safari and turns it into a visually confusing mess 
len ratingone I ll be switching to a new browser soon 
len ratingtwo I used to exclusively use chrome but now it feels like Safari which I m not a fan of 
len ratingtwo I personally don t like the controls on bottom it makes my thumb ache while using it one handed 
len ratingone And how do I change it back 
len ratingone This new format is a MESS 
len ratingone Even worse it updated on its own 
len ratingone I ve always used chrome because I preferred the design over other browsers why on earth would you re design it to look like everything else 
len ratingone I can no longer quickly scroll through a list of open pages I have to open a gallery of small icons oh hey just like safari 
len ratingone Back forward buttons 
len ratingone Top menu 
len ratingone Gone 
len ratingone They re on the bottom now and changed to oh wow just like Safari 
len ratingone At this point you have to fight anything Apple related to not default to Safari 
len ratingone If they re going to make Chrome identical to Safari well just use Safari 
len ratingone Absolutely hate this major update 
len ratingone The whole reason I use Chrome on an iPhone is because I hate Safari 
len ratingone All of the navigation is terrible and now you introduce tons of website incompatibility 
len ratingone I ve had to restart the app multiple times to recover 
len ratingone I love Google but this update was a complete waste of their time and resources 
len ratingtwo Chrome is a great browsing app 
len ratingtwo It s the only one I use and the only one I d recommend 
len ratingtwo But they just added a change to the interface that makes it look near identical to Safari 
len ratingtwo I hate the Safari interface 
len ratingtwo There just something about the way it handles that is really ugly 
len ratingtwo Chrome trying to copy that is bewildering 
len ratingtwo Please fix the look 
len ratingtwo This is otherwise a fantastic browser 
len ratingone Hate the new updates 
len ratingone The tool bar is better but after years of it being at the top the decision to put it at the bottom is awful 
len ratingone What are you trying to be Safari 
len ratingone Put the tool bar back at the top 
len ratingtwo The new update looks too much like safari 
len ratingtwo I liked chrome particularly because it didn t look like safari 
len ratingtwo There too much white and I don t like the way everything has been moved around 
len ratingtwo The tab switcher page looks nice though 
len ratingone  Google have redesigned the app to make it the exact same as safari 
len ratingone I used to use chrome because the different locations of buttons were easier and smaller they were moved from the top to the bottom and bloated up 
len ratingone The rounded aesthetic is absolutely atrocious there was simply no reason for it it is larger and just wastes screen space 
len ratingone Google decided to change this and then didn t bother to put a revert option in a simple settings menu 
len ratingone The way you have to go back to the old design is through their debug pages and enable about different options 
len ratingone Before this update I would have had a star 
len ratingtwo I live on Chrome and have loved it for years 
len ratingtwo Until the update a few weeks ago I would give it a star now with the focus of appearance they have lost performance and reliability 
len ratingtwo I can no longer upload documents from my mobile devices without it crashing I can only hope that is short lived 
len ratingone I hate this update 
len ratingone The bottom toolbar is the worst 
len ratingone You went from seeming professional by keeping most updates driven by function instead of form to this 
len ratingone I need you to tell me how to revert it to the previous form 
len ratingone I don t want this crap on my phone 
len ratingone Ugh 
len ratingone I hate that I have to give you even one star in order for my feedback to send 
len ratingone You don t deserve the one star 
len ratingone You deserve 
len ratingone Used to be laid out like a normal web browser now the UI is pretty much Safari for iOS 
len ratingone I used chrome on iOS because it was as close to a desktop experience I could get with an iPhone and now it s basically just safari with a google skin 
len ratingone They killed their app for me 
len ratingone Time to find a new browser
len ratingthree I loved the layout of the oldest version now it just looks like the Safari browser 
len ratingthree Might as well use that considering they function the same now and Safari uses way less data 
len ratingthree I upgraded my app yesterday and when the app opened later I thought I had opened Safari by mistake 
len ratingthree There doesn t seem to be much distinction between the two now with all the menus at the bottom just like Safari 
len ratingthree What I really miss is being able to swipe to close tabs 
len ratingthree Now I have to click each one to close it 
len ratingthree If I could go back to the old version I would 
len ratingfive Love the new browser and it s new features 
len ratingfive Very nice 
len ratingfive I can t stop using it 
len ratingfive Great job Google 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use Safari I d use Safari 
len ratingtwo Not Chrome pretending to be Safari 
len ratingtwo This new setup is a disappointing wannabe 
len ratingone The new update of chrome integrates everything I hate about the mobile version of safari into chrome 
len ratingone Put the layout back to the way it was 
len ratingfive Great if your trying to hide
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari I d just do that 
len ratingone Stop trying to pretend like something else when what you have is already better 
len ratingone FIX IT GOOGLE 
len ratingone Today it looks a lot like safari which is part of why I use chrome
len ratingone Pages load horrendously slow on my ipad mini 
len ratingone Suggested articles are not an option to turn off unlike what they say 
len ratingone Updates have features come and go 
len ratingfour Google Chrome for a long time has been my favorite browser across every device I use 
len ratingfour Whether it s my MacBook or my iPad or iPhone I always insist on having it 
len ratingfour If I use another friends phone that doesn t have it I download it immediately 
len ratingfour It s safer smoother easier to navigate gets rid of the phone browser feel and allows me to navigate the application with ease due to its similarities to its sister computer based application browser 
len ratingfour But I hate this new update 
len ratingfour One of my main reasons that I chose to use Google Chrome over Safari was its look and feel 
len ratingfour Yes Chrome is more consistent in performance and in my opinion a safer and more secure application all around but it was also because of the design of its platform 
len ratingfour It looked like a browser not some dumbed down phone based application browser that s difficult to look at and navigate this new update has done just that 
len ratingfour It s almost identical to safari now it s feel on startup is lack luster and it s left me to question the desire to change to this style of layout 
len ratingfour Updates are meant to be advantageous forward moving and thinking to me this feels like steps back and a giant step to the side to fall in line with Apples subpar safari browser 
len ratingfour Not impressed 
len ratingfour I d rather give this a star review because I dislike this new design that much but I can t ignore the backend performance that is still there so it is 
len ratingfour I hope the team at Google reconsiders this new look and feel and goes back to one of the main reasons that made them stand out from the others 
len ratingfour  rant
len ratingtwo  The iOS experience is clunky and not at all as elegant as I would have presumed 
len ratingtwo I am not impressed with the bottom anchored menu 
len ratingtwo I find it awkward in composition and function 
len ratingtwo Why make such a dramatic change 
len ratingtwo And why make the elements of the visual UI so large 
len ratingthree First off 
len ratingthree I love Google s products 
len ratingthree Chrome has been my favorite browser for all devices for a very long time 
len ratingthree Normally I d rate the app stars but I m not sure I understand the rationale behind the recent change to the UI for iOS 
len ratingthree The new toolbar at the bottom of the app takes up a lot of real estate and a few sites I use tend to use sticky footers for key actions Coinbase Pro for example 
len ratingthree This creates a clutter of buttons all concentrated in a single area 
len ratingthree I m not sure I understand why the search icon is so prominent since the toolbar essentially triggers the same action and works well 
len ratingthree Maybe you re laying the foundation to integrate more apps in that area as a menu with a long press and if so then I get it 
len ratingthree Still my favorite browser but wish I could free up that real estate at the bottom of the app or just have the ability to maximize the page content 
len ratingtwo Oh no 
len ratingtwo It should go back to the old version 
len ratingtwo This is not like Google anymore
len ratingone Redesign was completely unnecessary 
len ratingone Moving controls to the bottom makes sense with phones getting larger 
len ratingone But there s no excuse for the cartoonish look and eliminating swipe to close a tab feature 
len ratingfive This update makes Chrome feel more like Safari 
len ratingfive While I am personally more a fan of the old feel the update to how we see tabs and how we view pages from our other linked devices was an improvement a long time coming and well executed 
len ratingone I am not a fan of the recent redesign at all 
len ratingone Everything got moved around and feels like even more of a Safari clone 
len ratingone I used Google because the layout was different and most of the stuff was at the top 
len ratingone I can understand why they moved some of the functionality to the bottom but at least move the tabs back to the top 
len ratingone The redesign is terrible 
len ratingone Chrome wasn t in need of a redesign 
len ratingone Google basically added more taps and swipes to accomplish the same browsing 
len ratingone Feels like a store brand version of Safari 
len ratingone If I wanted to use a crappy browser I d use Safari this update is terribe 
len ratingone They ve made it more like Safari with the menu at the bottom and similar aesthetic 
len ratingone I detest Safari and loved Chrome s clean and sharp look 
len ratingone I hate this it wasn t broke people 
len ratingone Tried uninstalling reinstalling rebooting and reseting my phone after the latest update every web page i visit i cant scroll on 
len ratingone Should of just let it be
len ratingthree Love chrome because safari is booboo 
len ratingthree New update has chrome looking like safari however 
len ratingthree Please just keep the url visible and the navigation and tab buttons at the top 
len ratingthree Also all the UI changes when split screening are not intuitive 
len ratingthree Viewing on an ipad pro 
len ratingone Bring back version ui 
len ratingone  ui is garbage 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone keep pressing by accident 
len ratingone This is about steps backwards for the app I can t point out a single better thing in this new update 
len ratingone It makes the app garbage 
len ratingfive Feels a lot like safari but new bottom nav and page navigation is great
len ratingone Just go back must undo update
len ratingone This update is trash 
len ratingone Why would you make your app look exactly like Safari 
len ratingone Definitely a terrible choice and I hope a decision is made to reverse the update veery soon
len ratingtwo It s nice that they re trying to recreate the UI but it looks so garbage and it s not even as good as it was before 
len ratingone  Layout looks like a crippled Safari 
len ratingone Stop making it look like Safari or people will just use it instead 
len ratingfive It is a drastic change and I would a like it if we could get rid of the close all button move it or put in an are you sure function 
len ratingthree I like the older look the new update I don t like at all
len ratingthree When I tap the top screen to return to the top of the page it doesn t do it 
len ratingthree Could we look into fixing this please 
len ratingthree Everything else is clear and concise
len ratingtwo This interface doesn t sit well with me I m sorry 
len ratingtwo The toolbars really feel like Safari with the url on top and everything on the bottom 
len ratingtwo The new tab viewing menu with the grid is a cool idea but 
len ratingtwo Why did you have to change it so much 
len ratingtwo It doesn t feel like Chrome anymore 
len ratingone The redesign as noted by others is a literal dumpster fire 
len ratingone Quickly heading off to find a new mobile browser 
len ratingone  Why is this literally just Safari 
len ratingone What a bad redesign
len ratingone I do not like the new update 
len ratingone Please bring the old update 
len ratingone On my iPhone the graphics look horrible 
len ratingone This is true whenever I click on the menu 
len ratingone This looks very unnatural 
len ratingtwo The newest update has made the app feel extremely clunky and ugly 
len ratingfour Chrome has been amazing since I found about it but please don t make this update on PC I actually thought I was using safari and my heart sank when I closed the app and opened chrome again and saw this 
len ratingfour Maybe it s because we don t like change but I do not enjoy this update at all 
len ratingfour That is all 
len ratingthree I love using Google Chrome 
len ratingthree I ve been using it since it was in beta but I am not a fan of the new layout 
len ratingthree I have to agree with a lot of the most recent reviews 
len ratingthree It wasn t broken so it didn t need fixing 
len ratingone The redesign isn t so bad but the tab system is god awful 
len ratingone You seriously want me to press that stupid X to close a tab instead of just swiping 
len ratingone Are you freaking kidding me 
len ratingone Why fix something that was fine 
len ratingthree This new update is way different 
len ratingthree Please roll out the old layout 
len ratingthree Offer a classic view 
len ratingone I love chrome and use it on all my devices but this last mobile update looks like a Safari lovechild disaster 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone This new layout is so annoying 
len ratingone I purposely don t use safari and now that s what I feel like I m in 
len ratingone My fingers are trained to go somewhere else in Chrome 
len ratingone  y all acting like Snapchat doing dumb stuff for no reason 
len ratingone Lemme see if Kylie used Chrome too 
len ratingthree The newest version of this app where it has been completely overhauled 
len ratingthree The changes are for the worse in my opinion 
len ratingthree The design itself is not as elegant 
len ratingthree There are rough edges everywhere 
len ratingthree For example the address bar at the top looks poorly spaced and awkward 
len ratingthree The functionality has also been reduced 
len ratingthree For example why is the largest button at the bottom simply a shortcut to the massive address bar at the top 
len ratingthree I can tap that myself 
len ratingthree And why can I no longer swipe to close tabs 
len ratingthree Now I have to tap a tiny x instead 
len ratingthree Overall I am unconvinced by this update 
len ratingone  Ridiculously annoying 
len ratingfive Thank you for this great update 
len ratingfive I love the new custom display and the information site tap excellent idea for those of us who like to check the sources 
len ratingfive All we need now is better security measures for tracking 
len ratingone New update is trash 
len ratingone Basically changed everything around to be a clone of Safari 
len ratingone I don t like how safari is set up that s why I use chrome 
len ratingone Revert back to the original set up 
len ratingone  I don t mind the new layout 
len ratingone But the performance is terrible 
len ratingone The app freezes up certain sites spin and spin to where Chrome becomes unusable 
len ratingone I am resisting deleting all my browser data cookies passwords etc 
len ratingone Fix this now 
len ratingthree There are a few things I really don t like about the re designed app 
len ratingthree Biggest thing is that the navigation is now on the bottom of the page 
len ratingthree That is not intuitive at all 
len ratingthree I ve been using chrome over Safari because for exactly that reason page navigation is in the bottom 
len ratingthree Now chrome behaves the same 
len ratingthree If you want to switch that do be it but at least make it configurable i looked around but didn t see anything to move the navigation back up 
len ratingthree The other thing I don t like is the grid layout of other open tabs 
len ratingthree I liked the previous version much better as it s also more consistent with the open apps behavior on many smart phones 
len ratingfour Just wanted need to pop in here and say that I am liking the new interface design very much 
len ratingfour Great improvement in functionality aesthetics 
len ratingfive I really love the new look of the app 
len ratingfive It s quite beautiful and very functional 
len ratingfive I enjoy that if the app crashes or my phone restarts it acts just like a computer browser and offers to bring my websites back 
len ratingfive It s very easy to use and it s reliable as well 
len ratingtwo We need to click lower icon and move again to top to add tab which is more difficult and cumbersome comparing with earlier which I do top to down 
len ratingtwo Suggestion don t need reload Button instead add add tab 
len ratingone The add keeps popping up and I can t do anything on my web 
len ratingone Very disappointed
len ratingone If I wanted the layout of safari I d go use safari 
len ratingone This layout is horrendous 
len ratingthree I m not happy with the layout of the update 
len ratingthree It was much better before
len ratingone  Chrome s new redesign just up and kills any display of URLs paths past the com etc 
len ratingone suffix with no way to bring it back 
len ratingone Do Chrome devs not actually use the internet themselves 
len ratingone This change is about as well thought out as designing a car that frost the lower half of the front window so the driver can focus on admiring the scenery around them instead of looking at all those pesky roads 
len ratingone I never bother rating or reviewing these things but this is a legitimate deal breaker 
len ratingone I ll be moving to a different browser now thanks 
len ratingone This is the most unintuitive pile of trash I ve ever seen 
len ratingone Now I need to find a new browser 
len ratingone You need to roll back before you lose your entire user base 
len ratingone I hate it tool bar I want it back on top not on bottom help me to take it back to top
len ratingtwo Chrome has always been my go to browser but now for some reason they changed it to be more like safari 
len ratingtwo Think it s time to look for something else
len ratingone  star for the new design 
len ratingone It looks exactly like Safari 
len ratingone Lost the original touch of Google chrome 
len ratingone Please bring back the original version 
len ratingone I loved google for its originality but now it s basically a safari 
len ratingone The only reason I downloaded google chrome was because of the fact that I didn t like using safari
len ratingthree Why did you change it 
len ratingthree Now it feels like freaking Safari 
len ratingthree That s exactly why I downloaded it in the first place was because it didn t feel like safari 
len ratingthree Why can you guys just leave things well enough alone 
len ratingone Since the newest update the format has made everything difficult bring back the old one
len ratingone Worst update ever 
len ratingone Perfect example of fixing something not broken 
len ratingone I used to use this because it actually looked and acted like an actual pc browser 
len ratingone Now they updated it to be less user friendly more irritating and it visually looks so childish and poor it should be on a child s leap frog 
len ratingone I love even more that I wrote this after they updated it and it seems to have since been removed 
len ratingone Give me an option to change back to the old functionality and I will download it again 
len ratingone Otherwise this is the final straw for the endless bs you put out 
len ratingone I already have an app that works the same way on my phone why am I going to download a worse version 
len ratingone Whoever thought this was a good idea should find a new line of work 
len ratingone The old one was great 
len ratingone The new design is horrible please make a version of the old design 
len ratingfour Swiping to close the tab is a lot nicer than having to press a small x in the corner 
len ratingone Let me go back to the old chrome 
len ratingone This has become apples safari 
len ratingone It hurts to look at I have to take a moment to look around to know what to do 
len ratingone Bring back the old chrome or have an option in the settings to switch to the old version the better version the thing that mad chrome good is gone 
len ratingone I m switching to cake 
len ratingone Everytime I try to upload something the whole app closes out 
len ratingtwo I hate the new layout it s to bold and round and I feel like it s in the way more then anything how it was before was perfect and didn t need changed 
len ratingone Why redesign an app that works and people like 
len ratingone Functionality is fine but the design is straight garbage 
len ratingone I thought I clicked safari and had to check twice 
len ratingone The old design was fine as it was why change it 
len ratingfive Happy to see new features and convenience thanks to dev team 
len ratingone What was wrong with the old one 
len ratingone Why change stuff that is fine 
len ratingone Why not make it a choice 
len ratingtwo What is this update 
len ratingtwo I don t like it can we go back to the google from previous 
len ratingone I liked chrome before because it was intuitive and worked like computer browsers 
len ratingone With the version update it s just a cheap clumsy Safari knock off now 
len ratingtwo I love google chrome but the update just looks ugly and I don t like it as much 
len ratingthree I m one of those people who usually uses incognito and YouTube vids don t work on incognito pls fix that ok 
len ratingfive Period 
len ratingfive I really like chrome always use it 
len ratingfive However whenever I go to upload a file to a webpage or something chrome crashes 
len ratingfive It can get super annoying have to switch over to safari to upload file then switch back to chrome 
len ratingfive The new UI is fine 
len ratingfive  though I only have it on iPad don t have iPhone people are overreacting 
len ratingone Thought I opened safari 
len ratingone It s terrible 
len ratingone Last version was perfect
len ratingthree Was a fan of the previous version of Chrome but hate this new version 
len ratingthree They completely changed everything and it s harder to use in my opinion 
len ratingone I was just using when I found it using the UK google search 
len ratingone I wanted it to be U S A google search region ONLY 
len ratingone I do not like your new look on the browser 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I wouldn t have downloaded Chrome 
len ratingone Please go back 
len ratingtwo I don t use Safari I don t want Chrome to look like Safari 
len ratingtwo I want my old Chrome back 
len ratingtwo Please add an option to revert to old Chrome 
len ratingtwo Edit I literally cannot use this garbage I m going to have to find a new browser 
len ratingone Wow 
len ratingone I m shocked after seeing this new Chrome 
len ratingone The new design is awful 
len ratingone Reminds of some early Windows apps 
len ratingone Please add the tab button to the top of the screen 
len ratingone I loved using chrome on iOS but now the new update killed it
len ratingone Is horrible the look and feel are terrible 
len ratingone Wish I could roll back 
len ratingone I might as well use Safari 
len ratingthree A big problem with this option is that don t have alert confirmation and user easily can close all tabs 
len ratingthree Other problem is with tabs backup after closing we can t restore because the history is sync with account and was overlay with desktop history 
len ratingthree Please solve this problem 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingtwo I m currently using the mobile app on iPhone s plus ios and whenever I go into the browser and try to upload a document for example a resume it freezes up the app and then just crashes 
len ratingtwo It has become increasingly frustrating to have to deal with this 
len ratingtwo Why does chrome suddenly look and act like safari 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use safari I d use safari 
len ratingtwo Change it back 
len ratingone  Get it together 
len ratingone The redesign is garbage
len ratingone Used Chrome app for years and loved it 
len ratingone This new update is offensively bad 
len ratingone Go back to the the way it was 
len ratingone Or at lease have an option to choose the layout and design 
len ratingone If it ain t broke don t fix it 
len ratingone I needed to print something and for some reason when selecting the documents to print it will open all tabs open and will not let me leave it unless I close ALL tabs
len ratingone  star for all the functions but star for the new design 
len ratingone It looks exactly like Safari 
len ratingone Lost the original touch of Google chrome 
len ratingone Please bring back the original version 
len ratingone The new chrome is ugly 
len ratingone I don t like it at all 
len ratingone Reminds me of safari 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone Please please please 
len ratingtwo Really what s new this is boring
len ratingone This new ui looks like safari and it is garbage 
len ratingone One of the things I liked about chrome on iso all these years was it wasn t safari 
len ratingone Guess I m going to be looking for a new browser cause I m not a fan of this redesign 
len ratingone  Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingone If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone Wish I could rate lower
len ratingfour When we want to upload our file from drive on any site the app get crash or some time it opens new window so pls fix it
len ratingone OMG this is awful 
len ratingone Thought I d opened Safari by accident 
len ratingone What was wrong with the old pages view where I could easily navigate around and see full header details 
len ratingone Now it s just a small x box Also I m now constantly seeing aw snap messages on pages that once worked when I say once worked I mean this morning before I updated 
len ratingone Using on iPhone X Edit Uploading attachments from my phone using the browser now brings up the tabs view and crashes the browser 
len ratingone Keep having to restore 
len ratingone Also when the page used to ask if I d like to update a password for a site it used to stay on screen for a few seconds 
len ratingone Now it flashes up and disappears immediately 
len ratingone This is absolute sh t 
len ratingtwo I hate that the new look puts the name of the website in a thicker bar at the top of the screen 
len ratingtwo It s one of the things I hated about using Safari and now it s followed me to Chrome 
len ratingtwo I don t think the rest of the redesign is too bad but the top bar is infuriating 
len ratingone The redesign is not near as fluid or as good looking as the last design 
len ratingone The last design was perfect so why even change it 
len ratingone Google is simply changing it to stay fresh not because there are advantages to the new design 
len ratingone While this design is new and MAY be improved in some areas the old design performed very well and looked great 
len ratingone Definitely getting a new browser is an option to use the OLD design is not added 
len ratingone Please Google revert to the last design or give us an OPTION to choose between the new and old designs 
len ratingthree  I prefer chrome over safari but I do not like the new design update 
len ratingthree The bottom toolbar takes up too much of the screen and is unnecessary 
len ratingthree If the I could go back to the previous version I would 
len ratingthree The ability to reorder tabs is nice but I can t enjoy it with everything else 
len ratingone It s so much harder me to do anything I much more prefer the google chrome build
len ratingone I d much rather have the old style of chrome back 
len ratingone The redesign feels cheap and generic and there was hardly anything wrong with the previous design 
len ratingone At the very least we should be given the option of whether or not we want the redesign or the previous 
len ratingone The worst offense is moving the back forward and tab buttons to the bottom of the screen on iPhones 
len ratingone  It works just fine it s just I seriously don t like the new UI for Chrome now 
len ratingone I liked how it was before and I sadly cannot revert back to an older version to get it back 
len ratingone I might uninstall and use Safari instead if there s no option to change back 
len ratingone The new update is basically taking what was a superior app and transforming it into a Safari clone 
len ratingone What have you done 
len ratingone Go ahead google just take it in and read all the people telling you exactly what I m gonna say too the update yep it s awful terrible and frustrating 
len ratingone I m not even going to waste my time giving you suggestions because you can t teach a baby how to do code 
len ratingone I have a suggestion though read everyone s comments and fix this app based on that or just move to China and leave for good either one I m fine with 
len ratingfour Well the app it s good there is nothing to complain about but after the last update i found some problem with it which is when i need to upload a docx file to any website once I go to browse more to find my file then when i select the file which i want to upload the tab got frozen as i can even exit from it till i restart the app 
len ratingfour Hopefully you fix this problem please 
len ratingfour Thank you so much for this app 
len ratingone I ve been using chrome on iOS since it was available and I must say this new UI is just unusable 
len ratingone It s so jarring from what I m used to that I don t want to use the app 
len ratingone The flow of the app I was used to is just wrong and it just feels wrong to use 
len ratingone The end of a great run 
len ratingone I wish there was a way to opt out of this UI but alas I accidentally updated the app 
len ratingone The new placement of the toolbar is horrible 
len ratingone Much harder to reach and not as intuitive 
len ratingone Please put back at the top of the page 
len ratingone This redesign is terrible
len ratingone Nope 
len ratingone There was no reason to change the layout 
len ratingone Everything was clean intuitive and efficient 
len ratingone All you ve done is force me to relearn something that should never have even been a thought 
len ratingthree Great functional app 
len ratingthree I am NOT a fan of the new redesign 
len ratingthree It looks very similar to Safari which defeats the purpose of having Chrome in addition to Safari 
len ratingthree Bring back the old Chrome 
len ratingtwo  Having a fixed bar at the bottom of the view window is such a horrible experience 
len ratingtwo I hate that safari has it it s why I use google chrome 
len ratingtwo This update is bad get rid of the bottom bar 
len ratingone  What was Google thinking 
len ratingone This new update makes the browser more like safari in every way 
len ratingone Safari is absolute garbage that s why I m using chrome in the first place 
len ratingone Why change the secret sauce 
len ratingone Why can t you swipe to close tabs 
len ratingone Why are all the buttons at the bottom 
len ratingone Did they not work at the top 
len ratingone Why can you reorder tabs rather than easily close them 
len ratingone It s mobile 
len ratingone Nobody in the history of the universe has sat down and thought to themselves man my life would be complete if I could reorder tabs on Chrome for iOS No 
len ratingone Material design is not this 
len ratingone This is not user friendly like every other update for every other app google has come out with 
len ratingone This update genuinely looks like something that Apple would have released if they were given control over Chrome 
len ratingone I just hope so badly that this update is an iOS exclusive and never taints the good name of Chrome for Android 
len ratingone Nobody asked for this and it s obvious by the reviews that nobody likes it 
len ratingtwo The new UI is lame It s harder to close multiple tabs while leaving at least one open The new search thing should open in a new tab or atleast give an option to I have to scroll down to request desktop site which isn t too big of a deal tbh I dislike opening tabs from the bottom instead of top because my hands are too big I m not fat I m just really tall Please don t think I m a fatty
len ratingtwo New version is ugly looks like a child drew it 
len ratingtwo Worse long time users have to find familiar actions in new places 
len ratingtwo There should be an option to go back 
len ratingtwo Time to explore other non Safari browsers 
len ratingtwo It s a browser 
len ratingtwo No Chromecast capability 
len ratingtwo So very sad
len ratingone Don t fix something that wasn t broke to begin with 
len ratingone Was able to stream NFL MLB games just fine before the new improvements 
len ratingone All it did was mess up my streaming sites 
len ratingone It either skips now of just stops playing the stream and I have to start over 
len ratingone Then to make matters worse I cannot stream my games anymore on my iPhone 
len ratingone You Fd everything up with your update 
len ratingone Go back to the version before the bug fixes and performance update 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingthree its slower than safari needs speed improvement
len ratingfive The new UI is lovely feels so apple on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo  Really 
len ratingtwo You just broke my chrome experience 
len ratingtwo Not liking redesign at all 
len ratingone Rip to google stock 
len ratingone Gonna follow exactly in snaps footsteps with this new rollout
len ratingone This update is god awful please go back 
len ratingone I don t want to have to delete the app 
len ratingone Very unsatisfactory 
len ratingone I ve been trying to change my past code and GOOGLE will not let in 
len ratingone WHY 
len ratingthree New chrome is like a bad safari 
len ratingthree Please bring back and forward arrows as well as new window back to top of screen 
len ratingone Theres so much reason why I don t use safari because its got clunky interface but now google is now trying to copy it i got confused for a few seconds if i was using safari turns out it s google 
len ratingone I wish it is possible to reverse the update 
len ratingthree Seems like it only works occasionally these days 
len ratingthree It acts like it s not connected to the internet even though I have a connection 
len ratingthree A real shame 
len ratingthree I know google will fix it but it s inconvenient right now 
len ratingthree Seems like it only works occasionally these days 
len ratingthree It acts like it s not connected to the internet even though I have a connection 
len ratingthree A real shame 
len ratingthree I know google will fix it but it s inconvenient right now 
len ratingone I really hate it it not as fluid as I like
len ratingtwo I installed the updated Chrome browser 
len ratingtwo Now I can t return yo my original page by hitting a back key 
len ratingtwo Heck I can t even clear the screen 
len ratingtwo I ve been a fan since the beginning 
len ratingtwo But I don t have time to get rid of this feature The love affair is over 
len ratingtwo Missing my clean concise browser dealing with a muddied knock off of safari and the google amp obfuscation of the URL is maddening
len ratingone Like everyone else I absolutely cannot stand this new chrome 
len ratingone I wish there were some way to go back to the old chrome listen to the overwhelming negative responses here 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use Safari I would use Safari 
len ratingtwo There s a reason I don t use it 
len ratingtwo The LAYOUT 
len ratingtwo I ve used Chrome for years because I hated the Safari layout 
len ratingtwo Well now you made it look just like it 
len ratingtwo Way to go 
len ratingone I downloaded this app because I love the google chrome desktop web browser 
len ratingone I was excited to sync all of my bookmarks but it does not work 
len ratingone I have tried turning sync on and off in both locations signing out and back in and every other trick I could find online 
len ratingone If you want this for the sync capability good luck 
len ratingone Newer version is not supporting ads 
len ratingone Whenever I used to search something chrome it showed ads on top and bottom related to that search but now on newer version that s not happening 
len ratingone It only shows regular links websites related to search also they are not really related to that search please fix 
len ratingone I deleted my browser because of the change 
len ratingone Bad idea Brian back old design
len ratingtwo Always like this easy to use browser 
len ratingtwo Today app is update and all sites I try to go to say error website timeout
len ratingthree I use chrome for everything but why can t I cast a tab screen anymore 
len ratingthree Why did this functional tool go away 
len ratingtwo It reminds me of safari and I don t like safari which is why I choose to use this browser 
len ratingtwo I maybe finding something different
len ratingone Yikes 
len ratingone What were they thinking 
len ratingone I wish I would have never updated 
len ratingtwo I never wrote reviews but whoever designed this new look needs to be moved to a different department 
len ratingtwo It flat out looks dumb 
len ratingtwo You know when you turn on a really old phone and click an app that hasn t been updated in years 
len ratingtwo That s what this looks like 
len ratingtwo It looks like chrome time traveled years in the past 
len ratingtwo I m an avid chrome user and the design alone is making contemplate switching to Safari that s how bad it is 
len ratingone Literally no point in using this browser if i cant use the apps i have installed on my google chrome browser may aswell use Safari 
len ratingone Absolutely HATE the new update 
len ratingone If I could give a negative star I would
len ratingone The new update was unnecessary and awful it s nothing more than a safari copy now and isn t nearly as functional as it was minutes ago 
len ratingone Total fail 
len ratingone I absolutely hate the new design of the chrome browser 
len ratingone Why try to fix something that wasn t broken 
len ratingone I want the old version back 
len ratingone It was simple and worked really well 
len ratingfive I ve been a long time Chrome user 
len ratingfive I absolutely love the new look of this browser now 
len ratingthree Great app the new look is not very good I would love if the old look would be brought back 
len ratingfive I ve always loved how fast google chrome was on my laptop or computer but now on my phone too 
len ratingfive Awesome app especially after the update makes it look very professional 
len ratingfour I like the new design 
len ratingfour Better feel 
len ratingfour Id really prefer to have the option to close tabs by swiping them closed instead of having to press the little X 
len ratingfour That s really the only thing I got
len ratingone  Now
len ratingone The entire reason I have Chrome is because I hate Safari 
len ratingone Opened my app and had to double check that I had hit the right app 
len ratingone Hate the new look it looks like a rounded Safari 
len ratingone On Android when I applied for a job and the website asked me for my resume I could search for it a upload it and here on iOS on iPhone x I can t every time I want to do something like that it always gets stuck and I have to force close the app and continue on an android device or laptop
len ratingone The old design had the settings button tab button and url all at the top in a bar 
len ratingone Now there s two bars on the top and the bottom 
len ratingone The top bar is a waste of space containing only the url now 
len ratingone Previously the top bar contained both the url and everything that s currently on the bottom bar in the new redesign 
len ratingone Why waste space 
len ratingone Plus the UI looks so strikingly similar to Safari due to the redesign 
len ratingone Perhaps you did not consider that people enjoyed using this app because the UI was distinctly different than Safari s UI 
len ratingone I wish users had the option to revert back to the old UI 
len ratingone Worse than old versions of Safari 
len ratingone Terrible design 
len ratingfive Ui is way better the best Google chrome version ever used keep up the good work Google I would recommend this to a lot of people to use on iPhone and android
len ratingone Bring back the old version 
len ratingone The new version is awkward and clumsy to use 
len ratingtwo I started using Google Chrome because I hated Safari s UI 
len ratingtwo I loved how tabs were on the top and you could scroll through your tabs 
len ratingtwo But now they basically just copied Safari s UI 
len ratingtwo They even made the search bar rounder to look like Safari 
len ratingtwo Please don t do this Google maybe a combination of the old and new UI but not this 
len ratingtwo  This new update looks pretty but it freezes up 
len ratingtwo Anytime I try to upload an attachment the app goes haywire 
len ratingone Dear developers do you think I d use google chrome if I liked freaking safari 
len ratingone What have you done in the last update 
len ratingone It s impossible to use chrome now as it became bad copy of safari 
len ratingone The worst update ever 
len ratingone SHAME SHAME SHAME
len ratingone Using google sheets for inventory reports on iPhones is already frustrating having to hit the number icon to switch to numbers for each entry but now with everything switched to the bottom toolbar things are way worse 
len ratingone Not only have I hit the back button multiple times because I was going to hit the number icon they re in the same spot now with the bottom toolbar if the keyboard disappears and had to redo the count but you also have the report an issue button popping up all the time too above the keyboard which is also easy to hit 
len ratingone New design is terrible please change it back 
len ratingone Very poor please change it back
len ratingfour No issues encountered as of yet but I would LOVE to see a dark mode of sorts 
len ratingfour Not only does it look better to me but helps with the strain on your eyes at night 
len ratingone if I wanted to use safari I would open safari
len ratingfour Please add a button to the browser on the main menu for a one click access to bookmarks 
len ratingfour I have like websites that I visit everyday and I would like to jump to those sites by clicking once for the bookmark list and another click to the site
len ratingfive I enjoy this browser 
len ratingfive However I want to address that since the last update and this new firmware I have an issue with uploading documents online on this browser 
len ratingfive I m using an IPad Pro 
len ratingfive On the last firmware anytime I selected the document and hit upload it will just go white with the google chrome logo in the center of the screen 
len ratingfive With this new firmware once I hit upload and it will display my open tabs and I m able to exit the tab selection by tapping on done 
len ratingfive I have closed the app and have attempted over and over 
len ratingfive I hate using Safari but I need to upload my resume 
len ratingfive Please fix 
len ratingone The recent update makes the app look and feel like Safari 
len ratingone It looks as bad as Facebook and works worse than Edge 
len ratingfive It s legit 
len ratingfive Makes it easier to navigate 
len ratingfive Chrome finally did something new 
len ratingfive Like it 
len ratingfive  Hey Googlers Love the new update 
len ratingfive I even went as far as putting the new Google Chrome app alongside the Google Calendar app on my iPhone dock 
len ratingfive Shh don t tell Apple 
len ratingfive I may be overlooking something but I haven t seen a share feature similar to that of Safari where I can text email web pages 
len ratingfive Now if only we could make Chrome our default browser on iOS and Apple would open up their Siri API 
len ratingfive Haha
len ratingone I still prefer the old design
len ratingthree Can you add Cast option on phone 
len ratingone If you could switch between this new layout and the old one that would be great 
len ratingone But you can t 
len ratingone If I wanted a Safari like layout I would get Safari 
len ratingone Not this Safari reject that looks like it went through the grinder 
len ratingone Honestly its terrible and I m super sad I updated it 
len ratingthree Honestly I kind of wish I didn t update this 
len ratingthree Everything I liked about Chrome is now gone and replaced with a Safari look alike 
len ratingthree The only reason I even had Chrome instead of Safari is because of its layout and now it s gone 
len ratingthree Sorry 
len ratingtwo I LOVED google chrome 
len ratingtwo It was my go to browser on all my devices because it worked the same on all devices 
len ratingtwo But with this new update it looks just like safari which is my least favorite browser 
len ratingtwo I will probably keep using it because it is a reliable browser but i hate this new setup 
len ratingtwo Please change it back 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I d use it from the get go I amongst many others am not too happy with this Google 
len ratingthree Just updated thinking that Google would do right by me but no the new app is basically just like Safari 
len ratingthree Still better though because it s google but still a wanna be 
len ratingtwo Please make at least an option to go back to the previous chrome look 
len ratingone Tried reinstalling twice 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone If I wanted it to look and feel like the Safari browser I d just use Safari 
len ratingone They changed the entire look feel of it 
len ratingone Tabs don t even feel like tabs anymore 
len ratingone Now it just feels cumbersome 
len ratingone Guess I ll just go back to Safari 
len ratingthree I really like the new Design but i don t like to see my recent searches in the first page please add an option Like article suggestion to switch off recent visited websites 
len ratingone I have had problems for a while now crashing freezing but the latest update takes the cake 
len ratingone Most of the time it doesn t even start if it does it freezes or crashes immediately 
len ratingone Useless piece of software 
len ratingone Time to switch to another browser 
len ratingone Somehow worse than Safari now 
len ratingone Webpages are broken 
len ratingone Kill yourself Google software developers 
len ratingtwo  Eh on the new update need the old version back
len ratingone It just looks terrible 
len ratingone We need an option to go back to an older version 
len ratingone I don t know why they felt the need to change the entire look of the app it was in my opinion just fine before 
len ratingone It was easy to navigate and easier to use since now I have to tap all over the place making harder than just swiping 
len ratingone The design also looks older and a lot less modern I really get the iPhone vibe from it due to the roundness and curves on everything and it just feels so dated 
len ratingtwo Let us have the android version of the redesign 
len ratingtwo It s much much nicer 
len ratingtwo The bulky option on The bottom are ugly 
len ratingfive Let me first say I was caught off guard after updating the app it s so different 
len ratingfive It will take some getting used to but Google you have saved me 
len ratingfive I have a disorder that makes me joints prone to dislocation and my fingers ached having to keep reaching to the top of my screen to do anything in the old version of the app 
len ratingfive Having all your buttons on the bottom bar is so much more accessible 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingtwo I love google products 
len ratingtwo I like them way more than apples stock apps but some of the new redesign choices are horrible 
len ratingtwo Google tends to make refreshing and visually appealing redesigns but the new chrome mobile app is ugly 
len ratingtwo All the controls are on the bottom just like safari 
len ratingtwo They are bold and bulky 
len ratingtwo I liked the old lay out much more 
len ratingtwo Google please move the controls to the top and make them smaller thinner 
len ratingtwo And please fix your tabs page 
len ratingtwo I don t like the grid style 
len ratingtwo The old carousel style was much nicer and didn t fell as cluttered 
len ratingtwo If these are fixed I will gladly change my rating 
len ratingone I swapped from Safari due to unfavorable layout and now Chrome looks almost the same 
len ratingone Really don t care for the new look much less intuitive than last version 
len ratingone  I didn t want safari so I got google chrome 
len ratingone Go back to being different 
len ratingone This is horrible 
len ratingone If I wanted a Safari layout I d use Safari 
len ratingfour I like the old version and my app updated it self and I would like an undo of that
len ratingtwo When I open gmail in chrome I could not find sign out button I don t know where they hide it intentionally 
len ratingtwo I use both Chrome and Safari for different reasons 
len ratingtwo Please don t copy the look of Safari 
len ratingtwo You just ruined everything I love about Chrome 
len ratingone Moved menu to the bottom slower to load lost a row of the most popular visited 
len ratingthree Okay so I ve always used Chrome here on my phone but I really don t like the new update 
len ratingthree For me it makes it feel like it s smaller because of the bar now being on the bottom and it just gives off a really weird feeling 
len ratingthree I very much preferred the old version and I really want that version back 
len ratingthree Or atleast I want the layout for it back 
len ratingthree Other than that I love Chrome and it s the best I just really don t like the new layout because it s funky 
len ratingone  Whatever you guys did his app is trash now 
len ratingone It consistently crashes whenever you attempt to load download upload any type of attachment 
len ratingthree I do love Google Chrome and always have That being said however I specifically use it because I hate the way that Safari is laid out on my iPhone however now chrome looks almost identical to Safari in a way that makes me want to stop using it 
len ratingthree I hate the new update even if I love the browser 
len ratingone Go back to the old style or allow users to switch between 
len ratingone This new one is terrible
len ratingthree I absolutely HATE the new layout of Google Chrome 
len ratingthree It s too much like Safari which is the whole reason I switched to Chrome years ago 
len ratingthree Bring back the old version

len ratingthree Bring back the old version 
len ratingone  Chrome and Google will not log me in to my work account properly no matter how I try 
len ratingone Safari and Edge log in flawlessly 
len ratingone Useless app to me 
len ratingtwo The infamous You re a winner browser take over is impossible to close on chrome without completely deleting the app and reinstalling which then means you have to begin your search all over again 
len ratingtwo Google needs to beef up the security
len ratingone  Chrome and Google will not log me in to work account properly no matter how I try 
len ratingone Safari and Edge log in flawlessly 
len ratingone Useless app to me 
len ratingone Constantly bombarded with malicious pop ups despite having settings that s supposed to block them 
len ratingone Extremely irritating considering that when i re open the app it just pulls up the same page 
len ratingone Uninstalled chrome and reinstalled the simple google search app because I feel a lot safer using the google search version 
len ratingone Can t evaluate it if it won t open 
len ratingone Even tried to re install 
len ratingtwo  The most recent update was a blatant rip off of safari 
len ratingtwo No one I know likes it nor do we want to use it 
len ratingtwo Switch back to the chrome we all wanted 
len ratingfive As with all other Google products I ve used I really enjoy this app and the most recent update 
len ratingfive Many of the negative reviews I ve read are nonsensical e g complaints about things like pop ups which the reviewer could easily resolve by adjusting their own settings 
len ratingfive I like the new layout it feels more user friendly especially as the changes have made more settings and options readily accessible in my opinion 
len ratingfive I m happy with the product looking forward to continuing with it 
len ratingone i have no idea what happened but it s ruined now 
len ratingthree Google Chrome has long been my favorite iPhone browser app 
len ratingthree I never use Safari 
len ratingthree Chrome s old user interface was easy to use intuitive and mirrored the layout you were used to in your computer browser 
len ratingthree With this recent update it is nearly identical in layout and functionality to Safari 
len ratingthree I m really disappointed 
len ratingthree Now I have no good option for a reputable app browser I m stuck with two whose interfaces are not what I need or desire 
len ratingthree Google updates are always welcome and necessary but you ve gone in the wrong direction with this one 
len ratingthree Please go back to something similar in functionality to the old one 
len ratingtwo It gives off a safari vibe and I don t know safari 
len ratingtwo I only used google chrome for that reason 
len ratingone How can I roll back this browser to a previous version that i dont hate 
len ratingone Version has convinced me to uninstall chrome and retry Safari Opera Mozilla 
len ratingfive Everything I need to access feels more accessible on the lower right
len ratingthree I try to go on the amazon website and it just opens the amazon app 
len ratingthree I prefer the online version 
len ratingthree I want setting to either give or deny permission to chrome to interact with other apps 
len ratingthree Just my cents
len ratingone  If I wanted to use something that look like Safari then I d use Safari oh and the desktop chrome is starting to look like Firefox 
len ratingone  Please TRY to explain your guys choice on this new design 
len ratingtwo I love google chrome but I hate the new update 
len ratingtwo It was confusing and I liked the buttons on the top of the page not bottom 
len ratingthree Great app definitely better than Safari 
len ratingthree But the new design is awful don t like it at all 
len ratingthree I wish there were an option to change back to the original look 
len ratingone Safari 
len ratingone I have been using Firefox for the last year or so and the built in ad blocking is it s number one feature it turns out 
len ratingone I wanted to give chrome a chance but as soon as I started browsing I realized how much Firefox was improving my mobile experience 
len ratingone Just visiting sites like nbcnews com give a stark demonstration on what the differences are between the two browsers 
len ratingone I guess it really does make a difference that Google is an advertising network and Firefox is non profit 
len ratingone If I could reverse to the old app I would 
len ratingone I dislike this layout a lot I honestly don t know where anything is anymore and it s frustrating 
len ratingone Also their new layout reminds me of safari which I absolutely hate 
len ratingfive Since the day of my first iPhone Safari was the best mobile browser 
len ratingfive Google is my preferred plateform however Apple makes the best hardware 
len ratingfive I was stuck in the middle 
len ratingfive Well now I can ditch Safari and start using Chrome 
len ratingthree It s fine as a browser I guess but I am not sure whats the point of using this instead of Safari or Puffin or whatever when it won t let you cast browser tabs to Chromecast 
len ratingthree You would think that would be the obvious thing a Google browser would do that other browsers would not 
len ratingone Videos don t play when small only stills w audio 
len ratingone Videos don t play at all when you go to the YouTube website 
len ratingone Wow 
len ratingone If I wanted Chrome to look like Safari I would just use Safari 
len ratingone This New Look is horrible 
len ratingone I have to say this has been a trend lately with Google 
len ratingone It seems they have hired a few Apple folks and are now changing everything to look like a three year old designed it 
len ratingone They did the same with Calendar and now I don t use that either 
len ratingone Horrible horrible horrible 
len ratingone Terrible redesign of the app takes up more screen space with less functionality 
len ratingone Wish I could downgrade 
len ratingone The app was by far my favorite mobile browser however this newest update wasn t just a confusingly motivated UI overhaul it also broke basic functionality for functioning web browsing 
len ratingone I can no longer upload or save files without the browser management tab opening 
len ratingone The browser management tab also cannot close without closing all tabs even when you hit the done button 
len ratingone Terrible update that needs to be fixed soon or else I will be moving back to Safari
len ratingfive First time trying this app my best friends told me it s awesome app
len ratingone  This use to be a wonderful app 
len ratingone Now it looks like it was designed for a leapfrog tablet 
len ratingone The controls take up half of my screen and there is no apparent way to switch it back 
len ratingone I m extremely disappointed
len ratingone Ugly 
len ratingone I deleted app after update 
len ratingfive New update is much easier to switch between tabs 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone Aesthetics boring 
len ratingone Truncated URL dealbreaker 
len ratingone If I wanted a browser that worked like Safari I d be using Safari 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I would ve been using it 
len ratingone I do not not need this new look when the old one was just fine 
len ratingone I hate the roundness 
len ratingone I don t like that all the tools are now at the bottom 
len ratingone I prefer the swipe to delete rather than tapping the X 
len ratingone Overall this is the WORST version of Chrome I ve ever used 
len ratingone I m applying for jobs 
len ratingone I m on a job board click to upload my resume goes to my resume location click on it but I can t get back to job board now 
len ratingone Just opens up browsing page for Chrome 
len ratingone  The latest version constantly crashes making this app not usable 
len ratingone It was better when the buttons are at the top 
len ratingone New version still allows pop ups
len ratingone  Doesn t ask to save passwords to sync with account 
len ratingone With this new version released I cannot save new bookmarks only navigate through them 
len ratingone Fix this please 
len ratingone Everything was fine before the update 
len ratingone Now there are many thing that I will never use 
len ratingone I really liked having several links to my favorite pages now i have useless option instead of links 
len ratingone The options aren t new but now they are in my face 
len ratingone Ever since I updated the app I am getting scam pop ups 
len ratingone The pop ups won t allow me to stay on the webpage I am trying to look at 
len ratingone Fix this ASAP I feel like my accounts are going to be hacked
len ratingone It is slow 
len ratingone stop adding features just to add features 
len ratingone The older design style was just fine and work 
len ratingone When switching between private and normal mode it freezes 
len ratingone Stop the madness updating 
len ratingone Fix what works 
len ratingtwo I first have to say that I love chrome 
len ratingtwo It was always my browser of choice 
len ratingtwo I just updated it and now it s not as good 
len ratingtwo I m sure bugs were fixed and things were improved but what I really don t like about the new chrome is the new set look 
len ratingtwo The think I loved about the only look was the sharpness of everything 
len ratingtwo It looked really good and totally different from any browser 
len ratingtwo Then you roll out this new look and let me say that it is terrible the sharpness is gone and everything feels like it s made for the elderly and children 
len ratingtwo It is terrible looking 
len ratingtwo Everything is sized up to be bigger and everything looks like it s child guarded 
len ratingtwo It just doesn t look right 
len ratingtwo I ve searched for a way to change it back but that doesn t seem to be an option 
len ratingtwo I would delete this review if an option was made to allow you to change it back 
len ratingone Not a big fan of this new update I was a fan of chrome because of how different it was from safari 
len ratingone But this new update pretty much has it looking the exact same why go away from something that was working 
len ratingone Everything is changed for the worse 
len ratingone Useful settings are now hidden in the menu 
len ratingone Tabs is laid out pages instead of being stacked 
len ratingone It s a mess 
len ratingone Please revert back 
len ratingfour  When the password manager was integrated into Google Chrome months ago I was so happy because it was very slow and annoying to keep heading over to the website and logging in every time 
len ratingfour I thought this was going to solve my issue until I figured out that it missed a very IMPORTANT feature that I have no idea how it was overlooked 
len ratingfour I have over sites saved into Google s password manager and scrolling down the page of sites that has small texts and favicons is the worst 
len ratingfour A search feature is very needed and would be highly appreciated for users that trust Google enough to use it as a password manager 
len ratingfour Other than that this is a great app and kudos to the developers 
len ratingfour P S 
len ratingfour Making a separate password manager or integrating it into the main Google app would be very useful 
len ratingone I don t know why this app can t set cookies 
len ratingone I want this browser to remembering my accounts password but the website page asks me to turn on cookies 
len ratingone I cannot find where I can make cookies available 
len ratingone I m usually not one to write reviews but I cant even start the app anymore 
len ratingone the app was working just fine earlier this afternoon but now it doesnt even start 
len ratingone i love google and i will never use safari you can catch me pulling out my laptop before i use safari so its a big deal to me if the app doesnt even start 
len ratingone please give me a solution 
len ratingone i love chrome 
len ratingone I m sorry but you completely redid everything that I know so well and it looks like crap now it feels like crap and it moves around in the user interface is just horrible now
len ratingone Way too many steps to simple things 
len ratingone Hate it 
len ratingone Maybe need to go to Safari 
len ratingone  Do I need to say more than the title 
len ratingthree  If I tried to upload a file from icloud using a webpage it goes to view all tabs page without having option to open the tab where we actually tried file upload 
len ratingone This latest update of Chrome on iOS running on iPhone s never loads and always crashes 
len ratingone Tried restarts deleting app etc 
len ratingone but no luck 
len ratingtwo Not liking this new update to chrome it s runs slower for some reason 
len ratingone I absolutely detest this new update 
len ratingone It s disgusting 
len ratingone You took everything that made Google Chrome unique and bastardized it 
len ratingone You made it a cheap copy of Safari 
len ratingone For what reason 
len ratingone Chrome was already amazing tampering with it in this fashion is a punch in the face 
len ratingone This was my go to search engine app and I didn t even have the opportunity to stop this travesty from occurring on my phone 
len ratingone It updated automatically

len ratingone It updated automatically 
len ratingfour I really wish there was a select all when deleting spam or trash emails 
len ratingfour Not really a big deal but would be nice would give five stars if I had that option 
len ratingtwo i think you guys should give us an option to turn on or off the icongnito tabs from setting 
len ratingtwo because i dont usually use that tab so i feel like lot of space youknow 
len ratingtwo should add this as setting will be great
len ratingtwo i think rather than having x marks on each tabs i think swiping up or down or both could delete individual tabs one by one and keep the close all buttom 
len ratingtwo since iphone users are get used to swiping things from safari you guys should bring it as well 
len ratingtwo then it sill be perfect for all
len ratingone The new update is horrible 
len ratingone It s the same as safari and if I wanted safari I would just use it 
len ratingone I hate the tabs and bottom bar 
len ratingone I loved the top design from before 
len ratingone Give us a way to switch it back 
len ratingone Moving to a different app until it s better 
len ratingtwo Why redesign the app to look and function like the Safari app 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use safari I would 
len ratingtwo The whole reason I used Chrome on the iPhone was because it looked and functioned just like the android and PC version of Chrome 
len ratingtwo Is there anyway to opt out of the new design 
len ratingtwo It is a step backwards for Chrome since you are just copying apples old design 
len ratingone Please revert back to the old chrome layout this new one is bs 
len ratingone This new update is so terrible 
len ratingone We now have two very large screen blocks on the top and bottom of the screen 
len ratingone Deleting and going elsewhere 
len ratingfive Its really nice i absolutely adore the new design and options
len ratingone  How can I roll back this browser to a previous version that i dont hate 
len ratingone Looks like a rip off of firefox and I hate it 
len ratingone Now that adblock works with Safari its time to abandon this bloatware tracking crap browser 
len ratingone New Update is ugly bloated and slower 
len ratingone Don t update I m officially going back to Safari with adblock 
len ratingfive The new update released at start of September made me change my browser to chrome 
len ratingfive It was so nice I even migrated all my bookmarks 
len ratingfive Will be looking forward to future updates
len ratingone  I hate the redesign 
len ratingone It seems a copy of Safari which is why I use chrome to begin with 
len ratingone The old version worked so well 
len ratingone This new update just reminds me of Safari and I m not a fan 
len ratingfour  Why is it different from Android s design 
len ratingone Safari 
len ratingone Really 
len ratingone The reason I use Chrome is because the UI was past tense waaaaay better than Safari 
len ratingone  fail
len ratingone I would like it if I wouldn t get those scam pop ups 
len ratingone Claim your reward or you won an Amazon shopping gift card 
len ratingone And the bad thing is you can t close them 
len ratingone How about doing something about that 
len ratingtwo Honestly the app was literally fine before the whole new look redesign 
len ratingtwo It s even harder to navigate now and the whole idea was unnecessary 
len ratingone Since the last update chrome no longer lets me autofill forms on websites 
len ratingone Thanks a lot 
len ratingthree Haven t looked at everything on the new update but I do not like how the navigation is at the bottom just like safari 
len ratingthree I do like the new view for open tabs 
len ratingthree That s the only reason I gave it three stars instead of two 
len ratingfive  Absolutely loving this new look 
len ratingone Why were things just rearranged 
len ratingone This update is just a loss of screen real estate and looks horrible 
len ratingone The top bar is pretty much useless and the bottom bar is cluttered with redundant options and doesn t disappear when you need it to 
len ratingone This update is just for the sake of looking different and provides no better functionality
len ratingtwo I will possibly re rate if I discover new features with the latest update but I hate the redesign 
len ratingtwo It reminds me of the iOS Safari in all the ways I dislike it 
len ratingtwo I get that my objections are aesthetic but I m tired of unnecessary redesigns of apps 
len ratingtwo It was good 
len ratingtwo I like it less now 
len ratingtwo I literally opened this just now and thought my phone glitched and safari opened instead 
len ratingtwo The whole point of using chrome for me is because I hate using safari SPECIFICALLY for the layout of the app 
len ratingtwo The toolbar at the bottom is nonsense 
len ratingone After the update when I type something into the search bar it freezes and wont let me hit enter to search 
len ratingone It happens every single time 
len ratingone  and no Do Not Track 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingone Half of the basic functions of Google Chrome don t work anymore 
len ratingone It keeps freezing when trying to search on my iPhone and iPad 
len ratingone There s a reason I don t use Safari and having it look exactly like Safari is enough reason for me to dump both 
len ratingone Thanks Google 
len ratingfive Loving the new UI 
len ratingfive Looking forward to whatever additional changes that are coming next 
len ratingone The new UI is terrible and makes doing tasks such as closing tabs much more painful 
len ratingone There was nothing wrong with the old UI 
len ratingthree I go on any browser Safari FireFox etc and attempt to play some videos but after two or three ones no matter how many times I play another video it does not work and either I should reload it or wait until the video ends then that bug gets fixed 
len ratingthree I go on any browser Safari FireFox etc and attempt to play some videos but after two or three ones no matter how many times I play another video it does not work and either I should reload it or wait until the video ends then that bug gets fixed 
len ratingtwo i hate how i have to go full screen to watch a video now 
len ratingtwo it s awful please fix it 
len ratingtwo everything else is fine though
len ratingone  http https
len ratingthree I do not like the new updated version at all 
len ratingthree Like the last version much better Cannot get some of my bookmarks to load now with the new update
len ratingone Looks clunky and outdated 
len ratingone Please change the toolbar back to the top and make this sleek again like it used to be 
len ratingone I don t know whats happening here 
len ratingone I usually like all of google app designs but this new chrome design is outright ugly 
len ratingtwo But the new layout makes it feel like Safari which makes it not worth it 
len ratingtwo Might just use that instead 
len ratingfive This features is really nice now i can back out of app and listen music
len ratingfive I wasn t sure of the big changes at first but after using it a little it feels great 
len ratingfive The big thing for me is just how smooth everything is 
len ratingfive It s all very responsive 
len ratingfive Scrolling in web pages seems better than before even 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive  Faster easier to use one handed muscle cleaner look best browser for IOS thank you for updating the design 
len ratingfive I used to switch between Safari and Chrome regularly 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this new design and interface 
len ratingfive This is my go to now
len ratingfive I used to switch between Safari and Chrome regularly 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this new design and interface 
len ratingfive This is my go to now
len ratingfive I used to switch between Safari and Chrome regularly 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this new design and interface 
len ratingfive This is my go to now
len ratingfive Love the update with the buttons at the bottom 
len ratingfive Good job 
len ratingone The toolbar isn t easier to reach at the bottom you re just eating up screen real estate for some cartoony visual redesign 
len ratingone This browser is clunky and cartoonish like Android 
len ratingone Dumping it and using Safari 
len ratingone Too bad you had to mess up a good thing 
len ratingone The update has made chrome similar in layout to safari 
len ratingone I hate this layout and was the reason I used chrome 
len ratingone Time to find something else 
len ratingone This mess looks like Safari 
len ratingone I HATE safari 
len ratingone New version looks like f ing Safari and videos won t play on my iPad 
len ratingone Byeeeeeee
len ratingone Change it back 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingone  The new design is horrendous 
len ratingone It s like a bad copy of Safari 
len ratingone It s not consistent with the desktop new design which btw is also horrible 
len ratingone Chrome used to be my favorite browser until version came out 
len ratingthree Ok I will admit that the new design is aesthetically pleasing however it takes up a good deal more real estate than the previous version 
len ratingthree For those with screens that aren t as wide in comparison to others iPhone X here it feels like it takes up a great deal more space 
len ratingthree This is one of the reasons I don t like safari 
len ratingthree The UI takes up too much space as opposed to the page you re viewing 
len ratingthree That s of my vertical screen space that I can t use to view content 
len ratingthree Is there a way to revert to the old ui until this design has been cleaned up a bit 
len ratingone The update is horrible 
len ratingone It looks weird 
len ratingone The whole thing is awful 
len ratingone Change it back 
len ratingtwo I dislike this current version it reminds me of Safari from Apple 
len ratingtwo I already have Safari so why will I now need Chrome 
len ratingtwo Please bring back the design of how the tabs looked and interacted 
len ratingtwo Why can we no longer see the regular tabs and the incognito tabs in the same area 
len ratingtwo Why do the tabs look like weird cubes 
len ratingtwo The preview of the tabs through those cubes is less optimal to small than the previous version 
len ratingtwo I do like the ability to slide tabs around putting them in the order I want 
len ratingtwo I like the new design of the three dots settings history area but I dislike how easy it is to accidentally close all of my tabs 
len ratingtwo The close all feature would be better placed in the three dots settings area if it is even kept 
len ratingtwo Overall I dislike this new updated design 
len ratingtwo Once again it is just too much like Safari and I originally downloaded Chrome to get away from that 
len ratingtwo Also I greatly dislike that I can no longer view the clock wifi battery strength while using the Chrome app 
len ratingone They moved the UI to the bottom of the screen because It s easier to reach 
len ratingone Whoever made this claim has clearly never used an iPhone SE where the top of the screen is much much more comfortable to reach than the bottom of the screen is 
len ratingtwo Google why did you have to move the navigation bar to the bottom and not be visible all the time 
len ratingtwo Time is now wasted trying to figure out where the forward and back buttons are AND I have to fkox the screen down to view the nav bar 
len ratingtwo I didn t use safari because of that 
len ratingtwo Now you re making me reevaluate of I want to keep using Chrome 
len ratingtwo Why did you change the nab bar please 
len ratingone  The new update is horrible 
len ratingone Why ruin something good 
len ratingone The mobile web experience is trash and unfortunately illbe leaving you to to operah 
len ratingtwo Why all the histrionics 
len ratingtwo This app used to be easy to navigate I am suretechies like and understand this unnecessary mess but for the average guy like me you just complicated what used to be a no brainer easy to use app 
len ratingtwo Why all the histrionics 
len ratingtwo This app used to be easy to navigate I am suretechies like and understand this unnecessary mess but for the average guy like me you just complicated what used to be a no brainer easy to use app 
len ratingone Not a fan of the latest update 
len ratingone Looks like safari can t tell if the refresh gesture is still there or not 
len ratingone I think the consolidation of function to the bottom right button is also no good 
len ratingone The new layout is terrible and looks too much like safari which is why I have chrome 
len ratingone Poease change it back 
len ratingone This latest update looks like someone just tweaked Safari and slapped googles logo on it 
len ratingone I legit thought I somehow got a virus in chrome and it was forwarding me to some weird search engine 
len ratingone Is there anyway to go back to the old chrome 
len ratingfive Looks and feels a lot smoother 
len ratingfive No bugs thus far 
len ratingone Just add a couple of checkboxes to give the option to switch back some things 
len ratingfive Finally Chrome now looks as an iOS app rather than a responsive app 
len ratingtwo When I go to upload a file it gives puts me on the multi page view but I cannot choose a page to enter it I need to then close all pages and undo to be able to access a page 
len ratingtwo Still after that if I try to upload a file it does the same and I m effectively unable to upload my file through chrome 
len ratingone Fortunately it can for now be disabled with some chrome flags 
len ratingone Hopefully it stays this way and google doesn t force the redesign on us in the future 
len ratingthree  I just downloaded the most recent chrome update and it just reminds me of safari which I can t stand which is why I use chrome on all of my devices 
len ratingthree From a visual stand point this is definitely the worst update so far no major bugs I ve run accross yet though so that s great 
len ratingone This is by far the worst update to come to Google Chrome on iOS 
len ratingone It s just ugly and there s not much more to say other then it over complicates things 
len ratingone I ll be reverting to Safari from now so thanks Google 
len ratingone You always have a way of changing your applications even though they were fine the way they were 
len ratingone Huge downgrade lots of bugs hangs on iPhone X freezes constantly 
len ratingone The UI no coments just hire a new development team 
len ratingone I don t understand the need to fix things that don t need fixing 
len ratingone This update has changed the location of every option like opening a new tab which aside from annoying is now harder to access 
len ratingone Closing tabs is also made harder to do for some reason and the entire browser is slower and keeps crashing 
len ratingone It s changed to a completely non user friendly interface and it s tempted me delete the app entirely because using it is just an extremely frustrating experience 
len ratingone It s currently more trouble than it s worth which is especially frustrating because it was much easier to use before 
len ratingone At the very least there should be the option to change back to the old style the way they ve done with their new gmail design which for the record is a terrible design too 
len ratingthree This update turned cool chrome into safari 
len ratingthree I m so not used to the button layout 
len ratingthree I used to be able to do all the functions extremely fast now I have to stop and find them 
len ratingtwo When I try to open a link from my gmail the page switches to Chrome but never links up 
len ratingtwo Have noticed it for a few weeks off and on 
len ratingtwo Happens most when I m trying to link from a Glassdoor email 
len ratingtwo Job searching has become quite difficult 
len ratingone Whole reason I used chrome over Safari is I hated Safari s layout 
len ratingone Now Chrome looks just like it HATE IT 
len ratingone Want the old layout back 
len ratingone Guess I ll switch to a different browser 
len ratingone Is just awful 
len ratingone Do not like it at all 
len ratingone Preferred when it looked more sleek and modern not all bubbles shape that looks like for a kids app 
len ratingone Please bring back the old design 
len ratingfour I thought I was in a different app 
len ratingfour Thanks for the update now I have to learn to use it again 
len ratingone Updated The UI of the new update is beautiful and much more user friendly but still facing the same bugs First review 
len ratingone Takes years to load pages 
len ratingone Background downloads got glitches 
len ratingone When desktop mode enabled Google Images page searched can t be zoomed out after clicking a result 
len ratingone Needed to refresh again again 
len ratingone Can t control all the features options from the settings 
len ratingthree I love chrome its my browser of preference but the September update ruined everything the layout is tacky and every time I try to upload a document from my iPad to a website in the browser it bugs out by bringing me to the tab manager screen and not allowing me to select the tab that I was in my only option is to force close the app which of course logs me out of what I was trying to do 
len ratingthree I really hate using safari please fix this 
len ratingone The new layout is a bust for me i use google chrome because i don t like the layout of safari yet now google chrome basically looks almost just like it with a few differences here and there but it looks and feels the same as the stock internet app 
len ratingfive  Love the new redesign
len ratingtwo They recently updated the app so it has basically the same layout and function as safari hate that layout and hate that I can t go back to what it was
len ratingfive  My phone number is is Nomber Roberto Gonzalez is myself
len ratingone Why update the UI if it s not an issue 
len ratingone If you people are so bored and cant find anything else to do try develop something else that s more useful 
len ratingone Revert back to the old UI ASAP 
len ratingone The new one is counter intuitive and very unproductive 
len ratingone Dont be another likr Snap Chat 
len ratingfour Excellent new layout however it would make more sense to to switch the placement of the reload button and the one that allows you to copy links and go to other apps 
len ratingfour Also what about a dark mode 
len ratingone This update makes Chrome pretty much exactly like Safari the native browser I hate using and replaced with Chrome 
len ratingone What a waste this update has ruined the app and its usability don t waste your time just use Safari instead 
len ratingone Same interface experience 
len ratingone I have been using Chrome instead of Safari since I got an iPhone because I have always hated the Safari layout 
len ratingone Latest update makes the chrome layout the same Safari and I cannot stand it 
len ratingone It is so ugly and is nothing like the browser on my desktop 
len ratingone The aesthetic disconnect is bizarre 
len ratingone I m going to go find a different browser to use now 
len ratingone Bottom task bar takes up more space than previous version reducing page visibility and buttons seem like settings were changed to maximum font size 
len ratingone Looks like it is trying to be safari why 
len ratingone What update 
len ratingone Terrible new layout and feel 
len ratingone The classic design was fantastic 
len ratingone Please let me have the option I hate the new app 
len ratingone Might be uninstalling after all it s just like safari now 
len ratingone I ve used Chrome as my default browser both on my phone and on computers since the service was created 
len ratingone With this latest update however I have to say goodbye it s been ruined 
len ratingone Why is it almost identical to Safari now 
len ratingone What s the point in even developing an aftermarket browser if your going to be identical in both form and function to the stock app 
len ratingone Seriously WTH were y all thinking on this one 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Google would you make an update to mirror Safari 
len ratingone What are you thinking 
len ratingone Safari is a app that comes with my iPhone what would make you think I would want an exact copy of it 
len ratingone The only reason I used chrome was because it was a better gui than safari well I guess I will give Mozilla a try hope to god they aren t safari fanboys 
len ratingone Revert to the old version 
len ratingone The new one looks like safari and is awful 
len ratingone Please give us what we are comfortable with and expect 
len ratingthree cmon i use google chrome specifically because i dont like Safari and now you guys made it completely look like safari 
len ratingthree Bad decision google chrome on mobile was known for its simplicity and how it was similar to the desktop version 
len ratingthree Now now its 
len ratingthree cmon i use google chrome specifically because i dont like Safari and now you guys made it completely look like safari 
len ratingthree Bad decision google chrome on mobile was known for its simplicity and how it was similar to the desktop version 
len ratingthree Now now its 
len ratingone I don t want pop up menus 
len ratingone I want to flick through my pages with quickness and ease 
len ratingone You re GUI needs to be simple 
len ratingone I don t do reviews but you don t know what you are doing with this 
len ratingone I don t want pop up menus 
len ratingone I want to flick through my pages with quickness and ease 
len ratingone You re GUI needs to be simple 
len ratingone I don t do reviews but you don t know what you are doing with this 
len ratingone The aesthetics are tolerable if bland but the URL truncation is a deal breaker 
len ratingone If I wanted to be limited to the domain part of the URL in my browser I d still be using Safari but they decided we didn t need to see the entire URL that s why I switched to iOS Chrome in the first place 
len ratingone Now Chrome s revisors have made the same STUPID design decision 
len ratingone It d be okay if there was a setting I could change to go back to full URL but there doesn t seem to be 
len ratingone Now I have to go looking for a new browser again 
len ratingone I wish I could revert to the old version 
len ratingone Feels completely unintuitive and cramped the symbols are way too big the roundedness of stuff doesn t match the iOS feel AT ALL things should be defined curves are good but this is horrible the animations are horrendous feel mechanic instead of organic and things load a split second after the tab screen is opened 
len ratingone Before I though this app wasn t worth reviewing since it was obvious that it had basically no competition other than Safari 
len ratingone Now somehow I feel like I m using FirefoxOS and I m writing this just because a team of designers messed it SO bad that i had to let the developers and the people know 
len ratingone TL DR ugly ugly cramped unintuitive stupidly curvy and most importantly UGLY 
len ratingtwo Used to love it 
len ratingtwo It used to be different and wasy universal to use regardless of Android or iPhone Now it looks and operates just like safari 
len ratingtwo The best part was that it wasn t safari 
len ratingone The new update just made it a rip off of safari 
len ratingone If I like using safari I d use safari 
len ratingone The main reason I wanted to use this was to sync bookmarks and passwords with my PC version of Chrome 
len ratingone  ChromeSigninError com google HTTPStatus 
len ratingone  I was just thinking the other day how much better mobile chrome is than mobile safari because of it s better use of space not having a bottom bar 
len ratingone More real estate for web pages and better night viewing 
len ratingone Them update today and now it looks like mobile safari 
len ratingone Please remove that bottom bar or at least and a setting so uses can choose 
len ratingone No advantage to using chrome now so I guess I ll be switching to safari 
len ratingfive I updated the app today and tried the new version 
len ratingfive It is SO FAST 
len ratingfive Webpages even feel like they load faster 
len ratingfive I don t know if that s preloading or what but it s fantastic 
len ratingfive The redesigned menu at the bottom right is really handy 
len ratingfive The line separated sections are easy to scan quickly 
len ratingfive The tabs interface will take some adjustment but I do like the left right swiping to access everything 
len ratingfive And quick access to my connected devices is great 
len ratingfive I do wish I could still swipe tabs to close them 
len ratingfive Maybe swiping UP on one could close it since left right would switch sections 
len ratingfive Just an idea 
len ratingfive I never thought to write a review of Chrome since I ve used it for so long and I take it for granted but I m really really happy with this update 
len ratingone Google Chrome latest version is not supporting Google Ads very well 
len ratingone Upon searching something we see general websites mostly articles about item service we search 
len ratingone Older version used to show Google Ads Websites on top and at bottom but with latest update it s not happening 
len ratingone Not only mobile version but Desktop Windows Mac is doing the same 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX IT 
len ratingfive Love it soooo much more than previous version 
len ratingfive Thank you so much 
len ratingone  I loved using chrome on my iPad but the latest update totally screwed any Love I had for the product 
len ratingone I don t want a browser that looks like a five year old designed it and as I ve discovered you can t go back to the old version either so nice job on losing another customer google 
len ratingone After the update I absolutely can t stand the toolbar being at the bottom on the page 
len ratingone Who wants that at the bottom 
len ratingone It s not normal and so confusing 
len ratingone Thinking about it deleting the app
len ratingtwo Can I please set it to the old format I ve been using and accustomed to for years 
len ratingtwo I thought I opened Safari instead of Chrome 
len ratingtwo This new layout is awful 
len ratingone Google never listens to their customers and this latest update clearly shows that 
len ratingone Poor user experience now and just plain ugly and not user friendly 
len ratingone Who looks at this interface and thinks this is a good idea 
len ratingone Taking notes from Yahoo i guess 
len ratingone Google and their apps are sadly going downhill 
len ratingone Wish they got their act together 
len ratingone I want my toolbar back on top not liking it on the bottom 
len ratingone Since the last update this app doesn t stay open 
len ratingone If it does finally open I am unable to change websites 
len ratingone App will close on its own 
len ratingone But after this update Girl Bye 
len ratingone Perfect example of fixing something not broken 
len ratingone The toolbar move is horrible and it looks so childish now 
len ratingone The layout is horrible the tab view is horrible 
len ratingone Can t stand it 
len ratingone There is literally no benefit to this 
len ratingone I wanted a web browser that looked and acted like a web browser and now it looks like something that should be on a baby s leapfrog 
len ratingone Whoever decided this was a good idea should find a new job 
len ratingone Changing browsers unless you give me a way to change it back 
len ratingfive I want to Play music in meh background 
len ratingfive plz work
len ratingtwo  I ve always used Chrome on my devices 
len ratingtwo It s been fast and reliable 
len ratingtwo The current version updated in September is so slow and lagging that I can t use Chrome anymore until it is fixed 
len ratingtwo It s very disappointing 
len ratingthree Really dislike the new look way too similar to Safari in terms of organization and less like the desktop version of chrome which the old version was much closer to 
len ratingthree It s extremely displeasing to the eye now bleh 
len ratingone Chrome just made itself look like safari in this update 
len ratingone Not really a fan since I do not like the layout of safari and I loved how the old chrome used to operate 
len ratingone I also don t like that I can t swipe in a direction to get rid of tabs anymore 
len ratingfour The newly designed chrome is a bit blocky for my taste but it s sleek and fast as well 
len ratingfour I love the new tab grid 
len ratingfour Thinking about it now it was actually pretty hard to see what I had open and selecting them was a nightmare 
len ratingfour It s super easy to open tabs now too 
len ratingfour Also the toolbar is a great addition 
len ratingfour Looking forward to more changes 
len ratingtwo To prevent malicious pop up ads like You ve won an Amazon card I m so tired of it 
len ratingtwo The new version is just as bad 
len ratingone It looks awful now 
len ratingone How do I go back to the simple clean look of before 
len ratingone Maybe it s time to switch browsers anyway 
len ratingone  It said but I m and I use this at school
len ratingone I m a loyal user of chrome since It s introduction i found it to be one of the better browsers for It s simplicity and privacy compared to other browsers especially when using the mobile app but this update has me searching for other browsers for the simple fact that with the new tabs are now easily displayed history bookmarks recent this means anyone using my phone can now have the ability to click on the tab and view all my pages visited 
len ratingone That is a huge no no for me as I I m very meticulous when it comes to security and data protection 
len ratingone This new update does not make me comfortable at all as now i feel like anytime I close off a page i must clean my history on the off change that someone uses my phone and gets curious with the tabs right out in the open 
len ratingone With the menu option on the bottom of the page that has the same listing settings history bookmarks etc i don t see the need for the Tabs under the search bar it should at least be optional and can be either kept or removed by the user 
len ratingone I hope this can be rectified soon i really don t want to switch to another browser
len ratingfive the lady update was right on point now this the best browser in the app store without a doubt
len ratingone Animated gifs videos on sites like Imgur don t animate 
len ratingone Running on an older iPad on iOS 
len ratingfive Best update ever LOVE this app 
len ratingfive I liked this app before I liked being able to use Google on my iPhone as I use it on my computer 
len ratingfive The new update is AMAZING 
len ratingfive The new design is nothing less than beautiful and adding the new feature of being able to send the link of the page you are on with a simple tap was basically the only thing wrong with the old version 
len ratingfive MUCH MUCH better than Safari on all fronts 
len ratingone Good update however I was hoping that they would make saved passwords more accessible 
len ratingone There is no way to search the long list of saved passwords in smart lock 
len ratingone Please add this feature 
len ratingtwo Title says it all 
len ratingtwo The whole feel or the app has change and I m not a fan 
len ratingtwo Nothing is intuitive the screen feels cramped on an iPhone and I m getting frustrated 
len ratingtwo Very disappointed with a previously great product 
len ratingone  Way to change a layout that loyal users have been using forever all so you can rip off apple s terrible designs 
len ratingone To fix Put this in your url box chrome flags ui refresh phase Set to disabled
len ratingone Double tapping on iphone sometimes previews latest video on carousel mode even if I have closed tabs or cleared data
len ratingone  get ur act together 
len ratingone this app was good now its trash 
len ratingone CANT MAKE VIDEO WORK WHEN BROADCASTING TO APPLE TV 
len ratingone app is missing core functionality 
len ratingone this is atrocious and infuriating 
len ratingone if your updates gunna break the app how about you DONT UPDATE 
len ratingone you just lost all the reputation this app used to have 
len ratingone congratulations dilweeds 
len ratingone I am no longer liking my chrome app because I had to stare at the STUPID chrome logo when I opened the app 
len ratingone Also the google search froze after I started to search it again 
len ratingone It happened repeatedly since it got updated 
len ratingone I ve started used other browser app 
len ratingone Bye bye 
len ratingfive Much more user friendly
len ratingone This last change is just awful 
len ratingone It s terrible aesthetics are only topped by its terrible controls 
len ratingone Hope you re a right handed phone user because the new design does not work well for lefties 
len ratingone You need to include instructions on how to refer to the last version of this app 
len ratingone  of the people who download this will want to go back 
len ratingfive Such great improvements access to functions at bottom of app make it so much better and easier to operate 
len ratingfive Seems faster too 
len ratingfive Great job and thanks to the developers 
len ratingone I use chrome because I dislike safari now y all are changing to look like safari 
len ratingone Still no sound vibration only when opening app or talking or searching and no its not my settings seriously what do you do all day 
len ratingone Smoke weed 
len ratingone FIX IT 
len ratingtwo This looks like an uglier version of Safari 
len ratingtwo Much less intuitive and plain ugly to look at 
len ratingfour New features are cool and can definetly see how it will be faster when you get used to the new design 
len ratingfour Miss some old features tho sliding to close a tab for instance was much faster than finding the x
len ratingone If you are going to force a bright white bar staying at the top of the screen you NEED a dark mode 
len ratingone Not only does the new layout look like something for children it s far less user friendly 
len ratingone Will delete and not update on other devices 
len ratingone And I hate it 
len ratingone One of the things I disliked about the mobile Safari browser is that the navigation buttons were at the bottom 
len ratingone I liked having everything in the drop down menu located in the top right 
len ratingone I m gonna keep using Chrome on my phone since everything is synced but I d much rather it either changed back or the option given for which layout you want 
len ratingone I used to love chrome until they release the crappy new update on September th 
len ratingone Now I am unable to revert back to the old version 
len ratingfour I ready like the new look 
len ratingfour It is clean and not so boxy looking 
len ratingfour Would be nice to have a setting to open new tabs to the front 
len ratingone Loved the old versions interface will now be deleting google chrome 
len ratingtwo It s not terrible but you ve just moved stuff around without any new custom options 
len ratingtwo Maybe I d like to add more than commonly used links to the google page 
len ratingtwo And still not stop button 
len ratingtwo Bummer I expect more 
len ratingone The new UI is horribly unintuitive 
len ratingone Change for the sake of change isn t innovation it s some UX group justifying their budget 
len ratingone This isn t easier or better it s changing things because someone wanted to issue an update when nothing needed updating 
len ratingone Using chrome was my preferred browser until this update 
len ratingone It not only lags but websites I visit all the time can t even load correctly what s the point of updating if you re just making it worse 
len ratingone A blatant rip off of Safari 
len ratingone The bottom bar is a waste of space and takes up too much room when it pops up 
len ratingone Might as well have not had a top search option if there s a bottom one 
len ratingone I like to have as much of my browser showing as possible 
len ratingone Add a way to switch to the old layout and all these issues and one star reviews will be fixed 
len ratingone I really dislike the September update 
len ratingone It s now identical to safari which I hate 
len ratingone That s the whole reason I used chrome 
len ratingone Threw the baby out with the bath water i d say
len ratingone Are they trying to copy Safari 
len ratingone I don t like safari hence why I have chrome downloaded on my iPhone but I think I would prefer it to this non user friendly update 
len ratingone App won t switch to landscape mode even though rotation lock is turned off 
len ratingone Iphones
len ratingone Really don t like the bottom toolbar I want my old toolbar on top 
len ratingone How can I get it back 
len ratingone It kind of looks like a child designed it 
len ratingone It feels like iOS just after they made the app visuals flat 
len ratingone It feels like someone dreamed up an indoor soft play internet 
len ratingone No 
len ratingtwo  I dislike this current version it reminds me of Safari from Apple 
len ratingtwo I already have Safari so why will I now need Chrome 
len ratingtwo Please bring back the design of how the tabs looked and interacted 
len ratingtwo Why can we no longer see the regular tabs and the incognito tabs in the same area 
len ratingtwo Why do the tabs look like weird cubes 
len ratingtwo The preview of the tabs through those cubes is less optimal to small than the previous version 
len ratingtwo I do like the ability to slide tabs around putting them in the order I want 
len ratingtwo I like the new design of the three dots settings history area but I dislike how easy it is to accidentally close all of my tabs 
len ratingtwo The close all feature would be better placed in the three dots settings area if it is even kept 
len ratingtwo Overall I dislike this new updated design 
len ratingtwo Once again it is just too much like Safari and I originally downloaded Chrome to get away from that 
len ratingtwo Also I greatly dislike that I can no longer view the clock whilst using the Chrome app 
len ratingfive This last update makes it very easy to navigate your tabs and continue where you left off on any other devices 
len ratingfive Kudos to Google for making this adjustment 
len ratingtwo The new update is decent but I really don t like the tab grid 
len ratingtwo As far as I can tell there s no way to swipe tabs away 
len ratingtwo Swipe up down left right but all I can do is reorder them 
len ratingtwo I don t like having to accurately tap the X on the tab 
len ratingtwo It feels like a step backwards 
len ratingtwo Please tell me if I m wrong and missing something that lets you swipe a tab to close it 
len ratingone Please let me revert to the old version 
len ratingone They basically copied safari s layout and it s garbage 
len ratingone I only used chrome on an apple phone to get away from the safari layout 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari I wouldn t have downloaded Chrome 
len ratingone Rarely is an app or update bad enough for me to feel the need to leave a review 
len ratingone If you are reading this and have not done the most recent update stay far away 
len ratingone The design is ugly and just about all the conveniences I used the app for have been removed or relocated meaning I ll need to relearn one of my most used every day apps 
len ratingone I m stuck using it as I prefer chrome across my several devices and OS s but it s making me strongly reconsider Safari at this point 
len ratingone Google it wasn t broke what are you trying to fix 
len ratingone Please add a legacy mode or something 
len ratingthree I have been using Firefox as my default browser ever since they updated their UI and performance 
len ratingthree The i decided to try the new chrome app ever since they updated the UI finally 
len ratingthree I have to say it s clean and way better than any other browser specially the desktop versions 
len ratingthree I even deleted my Firefox app 
len ratingthree But then I found that Read Mode is not an available on the iPhone so here I am writing this comment while I m re downloading Firefox again 
len ratingtwo It s reminding me too much of the Safari app and I use chrome because of its ease of use 
len ratingtwo I think putting the feature and the tab number back in the upper right hand corner would be ideal
len ratingone I ve always had Chrome on my phones but I m now thinking of making the switch to Firefox 
len ratingone This update is atrocious 
len ratingone Not only does it look terrible but the UI is completely unfriendly when used with an iphone 
len ratingone Do yourself a favor if you haven t updated already don t 
len ratingone Tried saving a bookmark and it refused to show spaces until I typed another character 
len ratingone Which made it impossible to simply paste a desired addition without rewriting the bookmark entirely 
len ratingone It took a few seconds but complicated what used to be a mindless action 
len ratingone I ll be deleting the app as soon as I transfer my bookmarks 
len ratingone The new style is terrible and as I suspected not functional 
len ratingfive Two huge s for new th anniversary update Moving all the functions down near the thumbs make the experience ten times better Easier to get to bookmarks now So proud of google s work on this one
len ratingtwo You ve made it so Safari like that you can barely tell the difference 
len ratingtwo It s horrible 
len ratingtwo Why not something intuitive and new vs something that we all know and hate 
len ratingtwo No thought went into this change 
len ratingone Their new layout is not good at all 
len ratingone It s all to big of a change and nothing works smoothly 
len ratingone Doing anything isn t as easy as it was 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingone Can I just go back to the way it was 
len ratingone I hate this update 
len ratingone I appreciate the effort on the new Google Chrome overhaul for iOS but why on earth is the address bar viewable when I scroll down 
len ratingone The previous version of Chrome allowed this bar to disappear and it was out of the way of my content 
len ratingone People know what website they are on they don t need to be reminded by such cluttered links inflicting a major distraction while being consumed with content of the World Wide Web 
len ratingone Please restore the previous functionality 
len ratingtwo I do not like the new update it s exactly like safari the reason I download chrome is because how it s set up if stays like this I might as well use what s provided with my phone
len ratingtwo Change always takes some time to adjust but this is pretty horrendous 
len ratingtwo I thought I had opened safari by accident 
len ratingtwo HATE the rounded address bar 
len ratingtwo I used chrome because I hate safari 
len ratingtwo Both it s look and functionality 
len ratingtwo Please at least give the option for the classic look 
len ratingone Chrome now looks like safari and moves all of the controls to the bottom of the app 
len ratingone I used chrome because the layout was how I liked it not Safari 
len ratingone Now they are both and the same 
len ratingone Why did google have to mess with chrome 
len ratingone  If I wanted to be limited to the domain part of the URL in my browser I d still be using Safari but they decided we didn t need to see the entire URL that s why I switched to iOS Chrome in the first place 
len ratingone Now Chrome s revisors have made the same STUPID design decision 
len ratingone It d be okay if there was a setting I could change to go back to full URL but there doesn t seem to be 
len ratingone Now I have to go looking for a new browser again 
len ratingone I wish I could revert to the old version 
len ratingone New update is basically Safari which I was using Chrome to get away from 
len ratingone I do not care for the layout and using it feels clunky 
len ratingone Dislike the bottom tool bar 
len ratingone It is not easier to use 
len ratingone Really dislike the grid tabs 
len ratingone Give me back my old version
len ratingfive I m enjoying the new look with the main buttons along the bottom bar 
len ratingone  Used to love using chrome but now the new update is very similar to Safari 
len ratingone I think the new design has too many tabs that are too close together in one spot 
len ratingone Personally I find it more difficult to utilize 
len ratingone The design has too many functions for one area whereas before the update chrome was more efficient since it did not condense too many things on one page 
len ratingone Sadly this update is horrible and makes me hate chrome 
len ratingone I am going to use Safari from now on because this new design is too congested 
len ratingone The cramped layout and weird tabs are not efficient 
len ratingone Please go back to the old chrome design 
len ratingfive  Thanks for new design 
len ratingtwo Google probably should have let this release sit in QA a bit longer 
len ratingtwo It looks pretty but it s really flaky 
len ratingone Hi I am giving you star because you removed bookmark manager thumbnails extension from desktop why you don t leave it optional to users a lot of us have works to do saves a lot of bookmarks we could recognize it easily though the images saved on each bookmarked links it was very easy for us to handle our work with over bookmarks you didn t share any statement on the reason of removing bookmark manager addon extension like u don t care about your users and how that going to effect there work so bring back the bookmark manager 
len ratingone Everything changed
len ratingone I have been using google chrome for years and have always liked the way it looked and its functionality 
len ratingone With this new update it ruined everything I liked about it and turned into googles version of Safari 
len ratingone I ve never liked the mobile version of Safari and hate the way it looks 
len ratingone Now I m probably going to switch sense safari is the default for Apple 
len ratingone Hopefully google reverts back to the old look or adds an option to switch between the new and old 
len ratingone I ve used Chrome for years and loved it 
len ratingone It s been my go to except in the rare instance where a website will only work on Safari instead 
len ratingone I don t know what happened with this new iPhone Chrome app release 
len ratingone First I couldn t use the old Chrome so I uninstalled reinstalled 
len ratingone Then the new app would only show the white screen with chrome icon in the middle 
len ratingone Finally it logged me on I used it once 
len ratingone I closed all tabs then went on later and it is very difficult to get past the white screen 
len ratingone If I do the buttons at the bottom of the browser will not react to open a new tab 
len ratingone My once favorite browser is now totally useless 
len ratingone  I am able to use that lower part of the screen for other apps browsers 
len ratingone This issue is specific to the new Chrome 
len ratingone I checked and my iPhone has the latest update iOS 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingtwo Thanks
len ratingone You put the intern in charge of interface design 
len ratingone This is utter dreck 
len ratingfive New way of chrome is so awesome 
len ratingone Well well well 
len ratingone Chrome caved to the pressure of safari 
len ratingone Needless to say I hate safari which is why I used to love chrome 
len ratingone Well check this version of chrome off the favorite list 
len ratingone Looks like I m in the market for a new browser 
len ratingone Should chrome wise up and separate itself from safari then I would consider returning 
len ratingone More than likely I won t be because I know how this goes 
len ratingone Thanks chrome for turning me onto another browser 
len ratingthree I don t like the new update 
len ratingthree Needs more customizability 
len ratingthree I want to be able to put things in the toolbar where I want them and to be able to choose where the toolbar itself is 
len ratingtwo The new UI on both iPhone and iPad is terrible 
len ratingtwo If I wanted to use Safari I d use Safari 
len ratingtwo Change the UI back or make skins for Chrome on mobile a thing
len ratingone I hate this layout and can t change it back 
len ratingone  star 
len ratingone  The new update is horrible and the design is not user friendly and it looks awful I wish I could reverse this update and go back to the old format of chrome 
len ratingone I guess I will be using Safari for now on 
len ratingtwo I wasn t aware that Google and Mozilla were working together on this updated version of Chrome 
len ratingtwo I say that because everything about the new Chrome is disturbingly similar to Firefox 
len ratingone The old version was WAY better and easier to navigate 
len ratingone This new version is basically safari 
len ratingone When I first clicked on the app I thought I clicked on safari by mistake 
len ratingfour I love how everything is at the bottom not much effect on small screens but a world of effect on really big devices 
len ratingfour I like it 
len ratingfour Happy th anniversary to the best browser ever 
len ratingone This new update looks cheesy and lay out looks crappy and always crashes please change back please and thank you 
len ratingone This update is horrible 
len ratingone Please bring back the old chrome 
len ratingone  OMG this is awful 
len ratingone Thought I d opened Safari by accident 
len ratingone What was wrong with the old pages view where I could easily navigate around and see full header details 
len ratingone Now it s just a small x box Also I m now constantly seeing aw snap messages on pages that once worked when I say once worked I mean this morning before I updated 
len ratingone Using on iPhone X 
len ratingone Hideous knockoff of Safari with big chunky buttons 
len ratingone Looks like something I d have downloaded years ago 
len ratingone Barf 
len ratingone Listen I try not to be too picky about apps changing their layout but I liked the Google Chrome app BECAUSE I didn t like the way Safari looks 
len ratingone I don t understand why y all made it look like Safari 
len ratingone I m still gonna use it obviously and I will probably get used to this update but let it be known that I am annoyed and I wish you weren t doing it 
len ratingfive new update nice design
len ratingone The latest update is not working the app won t open at all 
len ratingone I have tried deleting it and reinstalling it still nothing 
len ratingone Any suggestions 
len ratingfive Sleek and New 
len ratingfive Looks great
len ratingone This app is now an absolute mess nothing works right for iOS users 
len ratingone A conspiracy 
len ratingone Maybe
len ratingone The new release of this app has a poor design 
len ratingone Reason to use chrome is that I don t like Safari and the new UI looks similar to Safari now 
len ratingone Essentially crippling the effectiveness of this app when it crashes every single time I try to upload files from dropbox to a website 
len ratingone Safari works perfectly so I ll be making the switch back 
len ratingfive Loving the latest update and new UI 
len ratingfive I am leaving it right there 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingfive The end 
len ratingone It feels and is layer out similar to safari the whole point people download chrome is to NOT have to use safari for a reason 
len ratingone I updated to the new version this morning and I m having trouble with getting on sites and when I click on the site it takes me out completely please fix this problem thank you
len ratingone Not only has the recent chrome downgrade forgotten all my credit card settings for auto fill but the iPhone version is almost impossible to edit the address bar and all of the tab controls have been moved degrees and all the other controls have been jumbled about as well 
len ratingone Speaking of UI today s update has that fresh from Windows chiclet look god awful 
len ratingone What a disappointment 
len ratingone I love Chrome 
len ratingone The latest update makes me want to stop using it though 
len ratingone If you re going to implement the bar at the bottom have the option of removing it 
len ratingone I keep pressing it accidentally when scrolling or dragging the screen down to either make a new tab go incognito or close 
len ratingone The pull down and swiping is much easier to use and doesn t take up any more space 
len ratingtwo Just did the update on the app and the new layout isn t what I expected 
len ratingtwo The overall feel of the app isn t as intuitive as it was you should have an option to revert back or customize 
len ratingtwo Definitely something to work on
len ratingone The new design looks like it s designed for a child it looks awful 
len ratingone In addition to this when in landscape mode you cannot tap the top of the screen to jump back to the top 
len ratingone It only works in portrait mode 
len ratingone Please bring back the old design making things round does not always work
len ratingfive The new update is great 
len ratingone The new setup orientation has the back button on the bottom and this is completely different from all Apple settings 
len ratingone Don t appreciate it at all completely disorienting and not user friendly for IPhone users at all 
len ratingone Probably intentional 
len ratingfive The new design is completely amazing and I just loved it 
len ratingfive The way that you can manage tabs and start a new search is just too perfect 
len ratingone  September update I loved the app it was the same layout as my computer so I knew where everything was and it didn t have the ugly round skin that safari had 
len ratingone UNTIL NOW 
len ratingone They moved half the bar to the bottom where I constantly end up tapping the back and forward buttons while scrolling it end up opening th search or settings menus 
len ratingone It s now a nightmare to look at and I might as well just use safari 
len ratingfive Awesome update 
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive Definitely seems a bit snappier at loading pages 
len ratingfive Great work Google 
len ratingfive Love the new update as of it changed by biggest problem the app now you can access everything from the bottom of the phone near where your hand is closest 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingone This new look is very unappealing and i do not like how the order of everything has changed 
len ratingone It also looks kind of childlike with all the bubblyness of the buttons etc 
len ratingone please revert back or at least give us the option to revert back to the older version
len ratingone The new layout is terrible 
len ratingone It looks just like iOS Safari 
len ratingone I use Chrome for the fact it was a way better layout 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone I should have never let the update go through 
len ratingone Cannot upload files from local device to websites 
len ratingone The app crashes every time I try to upload a file
len ratingtwo What the actual 
len ratingtwo Did a year old make the design for the new update 
len ratingtwo This is one of the ugliest things I ve ever seen 
len ratingtwo Take it back take it all back
len ratingfive In love with this new update 
len ratingfive Love the new design 
len ratingfive I liked the new style Fast and easy access to my favorite pages thanks
len ratingtwo I do like the tab button now what it takes you to but why are these button absolutely massive at the bottom 
len ratingtwo Looks like how safari looked when I first turned this phone on Downloaded this app to not have to see safari again 
len ratingone This new design looks like crap 
len ratingone And by crap I mean safari 
len ratingone I don t use safari because it looks like crap 
len ratingone Thanks google 
len ratingone Was fine with the old layout then a pop up appeared so I had to redownload the app and this ugly format pulls up 
len ratingone I liked the former design because it was easier to use and less clunky 
len ratingone Having the arrows and such at the bottom just looks terrible 
len ratingone Also isn t chrome supposed to protect me from mobile pop ups 
len ratingone Not cool 
len ratingthree But the infuriating aspects are still there 
len ratingthree I hate the swipe down to refresh function half the time I activate it by accident 
len ratingthree I never use it 
len ratingthree Same for the swipe from the edge to go back function 
len ratingthree Could you please add settings for me to turn that off 
len ratingone The new app looks very childish the other app design was sleeker no crashes or anything but I hate the new design
len ratingone  mobile app update everything was put on the bottom of screen 
len ratingone The whole reason I used chrome was its layout I hate safari browser on iPhone 
len ratingone Now chrome is a replica 
len ratingone I do like the tile view of open tabs kudos there 
len ratingfour Bug after pressing the clear browsing history in settings the browser just shows loading option and does nothing more 
len ratingfour Always have to restart thereafter 
len ratingfour Suggestion please include a dark mode 
len ratingtwo Overall I like the change the new bottom bar and the general layout 
len ratingtwo I think the IA was really well done 
len ratingtwo The new design is awful 
len ratingtwo Colors in the settings are inconsistent with the rest of the app font size looks too big on an iPhone X and generally it looks unpolished 
len ratingtwo Can t believe google released this as is 
len ratingone Please let us go back to where chrome actually looked like a google product not an Apple knock off 
len ratingone If I wanted to use safari then I wouldn t have downloaded chrome onto my iPhone 
len ratingfive I hated the old user interface and so I used Safari for my internet browsing 
len ratingfive But this update completely changed my opinion on Chrome 
len ratingfive The new design is very good easy to navigate and user friendly 
len ratingfive I will use Chrome from now
len ratingfour I love the new look and D Touch features however where are the Google services link that was on the top right Google Search page 
len ratingfour Either I m missing it or it s no longer available 
len ratingfour I used the links to go to the Play Store and was my favorite feature 
len ratingone The bottom toolbar unnecessarily takes up screen space on my small iPhone 
len ratingone Everything can fit just fine on one toolbar 
len ratingfive This new update is literally dabomb 
len ratingfive Now I have all my tabs connected simply and easily from my computer 
len ratingfive The interface is now extremely easy to navigate and overall makes for a great experience 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone If I wanted to use Safari as my browser I wouldn t be using Chrome 
len ratingone Your redesign just copied Safari s interface that had been around for years 
len ratingone This update got the worst design for the year
len ratingone The new bubbly update is trying too hard to look cool but the usability is lacking majorly 
len ratingfour The ability to swipe to close tabs has been removed in this Chrome 
len ratingfour I d love to see it back 
len ratingone Bad update bad design and very uncomfortable where is name of links in history 
len ratingone will be better if you will back old version
len ratingone I haven t considered switching away from Chrome in years 
len ratingone I m now exploring other options for my new mobile browser 
len ratingone If I wanted to bloody use Safari I wouldn t be using Chrome now would I 
len ratingtwo Nice going Google 
len ratingtwo I installed your completely redesigned browser and it wiped out all of the tabs that I had open before the update 
len ratingtwo They re not even in my Recently Closed list 
len ratingtwo Now I have to go through pages and pages of history to try and recover as many as I can 
len ratingfive Really love what was done with chrome app here 
len ratingfive Made it much easier to use 
len ratingfive Greatly improved from every standpoint including and most importantly functionality 
len ratingfive Use this over safari 
len ratingfive Only thing I could say should be added would be the ability to switch to a data saving mode 
len ratingfive I believe that feature is available on android 
len ratingfive Not on iOS though 
len ratingfive Unfortunately 
len ratingfive Again 
len ratingfive Great great app 
len ratingthree Chrome would be Best browser with Casting option and security issues addressed properly 
len ratingthree I Often get directed to fake websites that says to click and get Amazon gift card I don t have this issue in Safari 
len ratingthree Address the security issue properly 
len ratingthree One of the main reasons I use Chrome over Safari on my phone was that the navigation buttons were at the top 
len ratingthree Now they are on the bottom like everyone else s 
len ratingthree Wish there was an option to move them back to the top where they belong 
len ratingtwo  I never wrote reviews but whoever designed this new look needs to be moved to a different department 
len ratingtwo It flat out looks dumb 
len ratingtwo You know when you turn on a really old phone and click an app that hasn t been updated in years 
len ratingtwo That s what this looks like 
len ratingtwo It looks like chrome time traveled years in the past 
len ratingtwo I m an avid chrome user and the design alone is making contemplate switching to Safari that s how bad it is 
len ratingone This update is so bad 
len ratingone They moved the search bar and tabs to the bottom of the screen like safari and i cant stand it 
len ratingone Please undo everything you just did for the love of god 
len ratingone Now I come back and update my phone to find this 
len ratingone Good god google never learns
len ratingfive hi i have a problem about uploading files from icloud drive 
len ratingfive I m using app for work a lot and i need to upgrade lot of wifi routes so i m uploading upgrade filea to wifi 
len ratingfive everything was working fine but about a month ago it starting to crash as soon as i chose file for upgrade and now i m forces to use safari for uploads 
len ratingfive i really like the app it s quick and reliable 
len ratingfive plz fix the problem 
len ratingfive i like new looks by the way 
len ratingfour Really enjoy the look and smoother transitions in the app keep it up 
len ratingone  Still no cookie controls 
len ratingone Cannot block cookies on iOS version 
len ratingone Spy browser 
len ratingone No cookie blocking 
len ratingone Use Safari or Opera browsers
len ratingone  my favorite browser 
len ratingone It looks clunky clumsy bulky and out dated 
len ratingone This isn t a step up it s a leap backwards 
len ratingone Why fix what wasn t broken 
len ratingone The new design is visually unappealing 
len ratingone If that wasn t bad enough I am getting crashes after scrolling a couple of pages 
len ratingone Whoever decided this was a good idea on the design team needs removed immediately 
len ratingone Just like with the new gmail 
len ratingone  awful 
len ratingone Wish I could go back
len ratingone the current update that changed the layout is so bad it s not even funny 
len ratingone it s not nearly as fluid as the prior updates layout was 
len ratingone plz god help your souls before i go back to safari 
len ratingone  People use bookmarks 
len ratingone Why are they buried hidden away in a menu 
len ratingone Just copy Safari 
len ratingfive This is the best internet browser that I have ever used 
len ratingfive Now with a new and beautiful design 
len ratingfive Thank you Google nice job 
len ratingtwo If you could put the tool bar back on top where it belongs in Chrome that would be great 
len ratingtwo That s why I disliked safari 
len ratingtwo It looks and feels weird 
len ratingtwo I thought I was on safari before actually realizing it was chrome 
len ratingtwo The rounded ends of the toolbar and the blue font are great but it should be back to the way it was 
len ratingone The new update with the new face screen looks like a rip off of Safari and I hate it and liked it way better the old way 
len ratingone New UI is terrible and not user friendly at all 
len ratingone Tiling the tabs makes it impossible to sort through them with more than a few open 
len ratingone Having the back buttons and tab controls at the bottom means constantly accidentally pressing them 
len ratingone If I wanted to use something with Safari s awful interface I d use Safari 
len ratingthree I love chrome please is there a way to uninstall the update from Sep 
len ratingthree I very strongly prefer the previous version 
len ratingthree Thank you sincerely 
len ratingfive I seriously feel like I m on a computer now it feels amazing I feel like I m in control more and is so sleek 
len ratingfive I used it for seconds and came right here to write this review which I rarely do 
len ratingfive Great job this is the most mobile friendly browser ever 
len ratingfive I like that everything is just so intuitive and the bar at the bottom is perfect for doing well everything
len ratingtwo I don t want Safari I want Chrome 
len ratingtwo Bad update in my opinion 
len ratingtwo When I try to attach an image from the browse option the screen freezes and have to close the app and relaunch 
len ratingtwo Other than that seems good
len ratingfive I m not one for writing reviews but you guys 
len ratingfive Version is fast efficient and really nice to look at 
len ratingfive This is UX at its finest 
len ratingfive I m not saying there aren t bugs although I haven t seen any yet but really well done 
len ratingfive Thank you for focusing on the needs and wants of the user 
len ratingfive  The September th update was what Chrome needed 
len ratingfive Everything runs much smoother 
len ratingfive Chrome is the best and most capable browser by far for mobile and desktop 
len ratingone Wayyyyyy too much like safari 
len ratingone I stayed away from safari for a reason 
len ratingone Actually thinking about removing the app 
len ratingone Highly disappointed but nothing a simple reverse update can t fix 
len ratingone Please return back to the original Google Chrome 
len ratingone It was different and much better 
len ratingone  For all the right reasons 
len ratingtwo The new look reminds me SOO much of Safari and I absolutely HATE it 
len ratingtwo The reason I got chrome is because I hate safari 
len ratingtwo Now it s like why even have chrome when it looks similar 
len ratingtwo I liked having the bar on the top 
len ratingtwo The layout of the tabs in the new look is kind of cool but I don t like the position of the bar 
len ratingtwo Make it to where each person can choose if the bar is on top or bottom
len ratingone I don t like it how can I get the old one back
len ratingfive New update is super fast 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone This new app looks like a little kids toy or something 
len ratingone It is so bad I am actually switching to Safari 
len ratingone Why do they force these clown like updates on us 
len ratingone People at Google as supposed to be the smartest of the smart but yet they aren t smart enough to include a revert back to previous version into there update 
len ratingone I can t stand this update 
len ratingone I loved the simplicity of the other one and everything seems so in your face 
len ratingfive I love chrome it has always been faster than the rest of the browsers 
len ratingfive I m also liking the new design 
len ratingfive You are the best google 
len ratingone I loved chrome the way it looked the way it felt this new update is just wrong 
len ratingone There was nothing wrong with the old interface 
len ratingone I d give stars if I could
len ratingfive It s nice to get a refresh now and again something Apple could use a lesson on 
len ratingfive Really nice and slick interface 
len ratingfive I have the best Google Phone 
len ratingone Please give us the option to switch the layout back to the previous layout 
len ratingone It is kind of a pain to use on my phone now 
len ratingfive I like the move of new tab search etc to the bottom 
len ratingfive Makes it much easier to use one handed
len ratingtwo As a longtime user I m devastated that you have reduced the number of frequently visited sites on the new tab page from to 
len ratingtwo This is a feature that should be expanded or at least expandable by user option not reduced 
len ratingtwo You have replaced the thumbnails with other shortcuts that I will not use 
len ratingfive Yasssssss 
len ratingone I absolutely hate this update ver 
len ratingone I have the text size on my phone set to slightly larger than average because of my very poor eyesight 
len ratingone I also tend to keep a lot of webpages bookmarked in numerous folders based on the subject matter 
len ratingone Those combination of large text size and the tabs bookmarks design in the new update is simply a disaster 
len ratingone Everything I have open is either squished into multiple rows of overlapping text or crammed into multiple tab boxes only identifiable by two or three letters 
len ratingone Google Chrome is simply not usable for me like this 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Slick design very easy to use 
len ratingone I m not a big fan of it liked it better before this update
len ratingone Was great until this update 
len ratingone Now it looks cheap and isn t intuitive 
len ratingone Put the nav bar back on the top where it belongs 
len ratingfive Love the new update they took the best parts of the clean and use to use safari browser and added pretty much all the good stuff to chrome 
len ratingfive My only wish is that you could have your bookmarks pull up on a new tab so you can easily go to a bookmark with less taps like on safari 
len ratingone This is now essentially safari 
len ratingone I hate the new look 
len ratingfive The new update is great it was time for a change 
len ratingone  Leaving a star review for now because there is no longer a green lock icon it just a lock icon 
len ratingone This may be a small grievance but a big part of chrome has always been the ease of security built in 
len ratingone The green lock icon vs just a lock icon is not a great design decision 
len ratingone At least in the desktop browser there s an option to revert back to the old appearance in gmail and chrome 
len ratingone Here you swap up and down for where navigation is for no reason I can fathom 
len ratingone I much preferred the old interface to choose between tabs rather than the new version 
len ratingone Every button seems rounder than before it s like I went back to the Fisher Price edition of Windows XP 
len ratingfive I LOVE IT 
len ratingfive It s obvious I love it bc I never write a review for chrome bc it s a staple right 
len ratingfive But I had to gush about this new update 
len ratingfive I read the description first and I thought it would be a groaning attempt to be like Safari but no 
len ratingfive It s so much more useful and better to use than the previous Chrome and way way WAAAY better than Safari now I love it 
len ratingfive I can t believe google made chrome even easier and better to use 
len ratingfive Thank you for all your hard work and thank you for the new experience 
len ratingfive Thumbs up 
len ratingone It takes around five seconds or more to load from background or to exit the app after pressing the home button 
len ratingone Holding any of the bottom menu buttons takes a while for the extended options to come up and there is input lag when typing in any text field including the url bar 
len ratingfive Best update
len ratingone As the title implies after the most recent update no matter how you hold your finger no matter how long you hold your finger for you cannot select copy highlight look up replace search paste magnify etc 
len ratingone any type of text 
len ratingone This version is so ugly that I want to give up using chrome I like the old version how can I go back to it 
len ratingthree This is a deal breaker 
len ratingthree Enjoy using the Chrome on the Mac book but I want privacy ESPECIALLY with all the data going to advertisers 
len ratingthree No thanks 
len ratingthree Please update Do not track availability for iOS I ll stick with Safari in the meantime 
len ratingthree Thank you
len ratingtwo The new redesign recently released is terrible make it look like android chrome design or make new design or put it back how it was before this update 
len ratingone I have always used and loved chrome UNTIL this update 
len ratingone I have used it because it is not like a very other mobile browser it was better 
len ratingone And now it s jus like the rest We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingtwo this new update has changed the layout to look just like the safari app 
len ratingtwo i used google chrome instead of safari on my iphone because i hate the way safari looks 
len ratingtwo please change it back or give an option to change the layout back
len ratingone First search with newly designed chrome and I got a pop up ad for amazon gift card I can t get rid of Any suggestions 
len ratingone  The toolbar move is horrible and it looks so childish now 
len ratingone Can t stand it 
len ratingone There is literally no benefit to this 
len ratingone I wanted a web browser that looked and acted like a web browser and now it looks like something that should be on a leapfrog 
len ratingone Whoever decided this was a good idea should find a new job 
len ratingone Changing browsers 
len ratingone  Just keep it simple and stop adding junk
len ratingfive  Love the new chrome it s fantastic 
len ratingfive Thank you google
len ratingfive Great update
len ratingfour Thank you for making Chrome look like the version on Android much appreciate it
len ratingfour I want my old UI back 
len ratingfour I love the new interface update 
len ratingfour It s sleeker effective and easy to use 
len ratingfour I haven t seen all the new bells and whistles but so far so good 
len ratingfour I love it 
len ratingfive Love the new look and feel 
len ratingfive The buttons on the bottom definitely make it easy to navigate 
len ratingfour  Would be nice if you could disable bookmark suggestions when typing in the search box or for a way to mark a bookmark as hidden if you know what I mean 
len ratingfour New redesign looks great 
len ratingone Been going on since June now 
len ratingone The app locks up MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY 
len ratingone Crash crash crash crash 
len ratingone No way to fix it it just stops opening at all 
len ratingone This requires a full reboot of the phone you can t just kill the app to fix it 
len ratingone Completely unacceptable 
len ratingone The removal of the save copy image option is real 
len ratingone They expect you to screenshot things now the workarounds aren t real 
len ratingone The new UI took steps backwards and is exactly like Safari 
len ratingone If I wanted Safari I d use Safari 
len ratingfive I love the new update 
len ratingfive Thanks for bring back swiping 
len ratingfive Love the new UI the placement of the controls at the bottom is very ergonomic 
len ratingfive Please share your improved design with the gmail app team 
len ratingone Why the heck did you decide to mimic Apple 
len ratingone Chrome looks exactly like Safari now 
len ratingone The reason I use Chrome is to get away from the Safari format 
len ratingone Is it possible to add a setting option to have it look like the previous look 
len ratingthree The new changes are welcome and the chrome browser is awesome as always congratulations on years anniversary Every service from google is great but still I can t trust Google on privacy
len ratingfive I can t believe it s taken years to finally get the TOOLBAR moved to the bottom but it s finally happened and I m ecstatic 
len ratingfive I haven t had a chance to use the app much since the update to see what if anything needs improvement but I can t wait to use it more now 
len ratingfive THANKS GOOGLE 
len ratingone But why would you copy safari s UI 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone I loved the fact the old UI because it stayed out of the way 
len ratingone Now we have the same terrible bottom bar from Safari 
len ratingone Who thought this was a good idea 
len ratingone This essentially means that the only thing over safari at this point is the better speeds which isn t always true 
len ratingone Could we get an option for the old UI for users don t have a tool bar taking up the bottom part of the screen at least 
len ratingone I think it is very kiri browser safari is so much better than it
len ratingfive This browser is great and easy to use and search everythingon the web 
len ratingfour I had to delete and reinstall the app because that pop up didn t even has an option to close it like the x or word close 
len ratingfour Only a link to accept that supposedly I got a price and of course I would not click on it 
len ratingfour The whole screen is blocked but I m able to use multitask and from there I close Chrome and immediately delete it
len ratingfive The sleek new look in the most recent update makes it so much easier to get to the different tabs bookmarks and settings 
len ratingfive Finally I can go from tab to tab without accidentally closing one I LOVE IT 
len ratingone I absolutely despise this update 
len ratingone It s ugly and confusing to use
len ratingfive I m a big fan of the redesign and functionality of the September th update 
len ratingfive Very clean fast and organized 
len ratingfive The new UI is delightfully intuitive 
len ratingfive Tabs are easier to use access to my historical browsing is fantastic and it feels quite modern 
len ratingfive Bottom toolbar is brilliant 
len ratingthree I really dislike the new UI 
len ratingthree It looks nice and will be fine on my PC but it doesn t work well on mobile devices 
len ratingthree The tabs eat up too much vertical space and new tabs now requires moving from the top right to open the new tab and then moving down to the bottom to choose the site 
len ratingthree Also the reduced number of displayed recent tabs makes no sense at all 
len ratingthree The app should be smarter about maximizing the use of screen space particularly for tablets and larger smartphones 
len ratingthree Once every couple of weeks I get a pop up that won t go away so I have to delete the app and reinstall it 
len ratingthree And this is on a highly secured company phone 
len ratingone Move the menu bar back to the top or at least give us the option to put it where we want 
len ratingone The new version is too much like Apple Safari now the back button and tab access button should never be on the bottom 
len ratingone This is a main reason that I used to choose Chrome over Safari 
len ratingone It s been going around on the Safari and Facebook app for a while now and it s come to Chrome in full force 
len ratingone Almost every link I click will after it finishes loading redirect me to Spreediscount com or a fake Amazon homepage saying that You ve won a free Iphone X 
len ratingone Safari and Facebook have known fixes but Chrome does not 
len ratingone I ve cleared my cache reset Chrome to defaults done while in airplane mode and nothing gets rid of it 
len ratingone Trying to reinstall the App right now but this is ridiculous 
len ratingone Update even reinstalling the app did nothing to fix this issue 
len ratingone Google searches and google support offer no help 
len ratingone Terrible app with Google s usual terrible support 
len ratingfive  Expectacular
len ratingone Please do something about these pop up ads
len ratingone  The only thing worse than Hulu s streaming service is the Hulu app 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is great for searching items you couldn t imagine 
len ratingfive Love every minute of it 
len ratingone Does anyone know how to make the google homepage not the desktop version 
len ratingone The desktop version on an iPhone is really inconvenient 
len ratingone I have having to zoom in and out all the time 
len ratingone I didn t change any of the settings I didn t log off of the google account and it was just fine yesterday 
len ratingone I uninstalled and I m using safari now 
len ratingtwo Idk what s going on but I can t upload my resumes when I am applying for jobs 
len ratingtwo My screen goes black 
len ratingtwo I m also not allowed to play certain games as there is sometimes a black screen or black box over the buttons 
len ratingtwo Please help or fix it 
len ratingone  I ve been a long term user of Google Chrome and love it on my PC 
len ratingone But after the most recent update I have been unable to upload files on my iPad or my iPhone 
len ratingone Every time I attempt to upload the app crashes and freezes on both devices 
len ratingone I hope you can fix this soon 
len ratingone I will update the stars to an appropriate rating afterwards as well 
len ratingtwo When using Chrome to surf the web I frequently get a pop up telling me that I have won something 
len ratingtwo  us frivoledkm icu says Congratulations 
len ratingtwo You are a winner There is no way to close the window or remove the tab without clicking ok or uninstalling the app 
len ratingtwo Obviously clicking ok is not an option so I uninstall 
len ratingtwo This is very frustrating 
len ratingtwo Why the lack of security Google 
len ratingtwo  Any review left is for other users 
len ratingtwo Both the desktop and mobile version are becomingly increasingly slow and frustrating to use 
len ratingtwo Sync issues are becoming more common and problematic 
len ratingtwo Would like to find a browser where I can import my bookmarks to 
len ratingtwo Both my iPhone and iPad have the most recent update 
len ratingtwo The iPhone app allows all open tabs to be closed at the same time but the iPad version doesn t 
len ratingone I just downloaded Chrome and upon opening it I was deluged with a bevy of pop ups 
len ratingone I tried very unsuccessfully to close them but they would just re open immediately 
len ratingone Thus I m going to delete Chrome since I don t want any malicious malware taking over my phone 
len ratingone Very big disappointment 
len ratingfour I wish as I was scrolling through a webpage that the top search bar would fade away to give me more screen reading space wording this a bit inaccurately probably I also wished I could cast from the Chrome app 
len ratingone Download a different browser 
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingone I try to upload a CV and it crashed on me like times I think it was my phone so I try a other phone it did the same so I use safari and i get my CV on the website please fix it I like using chrome
len ratingone When desktop mode enabled Google Images page searched can t be zoomed out after clicking a result 
len ratingone Needed to refresh again again 
len ratingone Can t control all the features options from the settings 
len ratingtwo Slow launch speed 
len ratingtwo The performance is not as good as Safari
len ratingone Latest update makes me close and reopen chrome wherever I switch tabs 
len ratingone Hope this will be fixed soon 
len ratingthree Doesn t has download option why 
len ratingone Do more usability testing and redesign from scratch
len ratingone working it freezes and then ur unable to remove
len ratingfive The conservatives taking shots at Google are only following their pied pipers lead 
len ratingfive They re only lashing out because they fail to grasp the simple principles of SEO optimization 
len ratingfive The sample set of this alt right analysis only consisted of TWO computers which is completely worthless and laughable 
len ratingone Google spies on you
len ratingfive My YouTube channel is Spectate Gaming but why I have been using google for about six years is because that I have been using it for school for that it is one of the fastest apps I used from my classrooms plus we have been starting to use Chromebooks instead of dell computers which Chromebooks are more better than dell is 
len ratingfive So I highly recommend that you should always use it it is good for class and on the go thank you Google 
len ratingtwo Please add for us mobile users to have extensions 
len ratingone Google silences conservative views via this app 
len ratingfive Works great for school and work 
len ratingfive Some bugs but not major 
len ratingone It s not letting me make a thumbnail it s saying my file is to big like what the heck 
len ratingthree  Please add confirmation for the close all tabs button 
len ratingthree I know I shouldn t have tabs open but I also feel like the Close All Tabs button is entirely too close to the New Incognito Tab button 
len ratingthree Edit I m an idiot and did it again 
len ratingthree Yes it s my fault 
len ratingthree Removing another star nonetheless 
len ratingone Seems the background process keeps running and consumes around battery every hrs 
len ratingone This has been my go to browser for years not it unusable as it locks up at the white screen with logo sometimes will go to browser with saved tabs missing 
len ratingone I tried deleting reinstalling without success 
len ratingone This is so irritating things
len ratingone Unable to copy images in chrome
len ratingone  Google suppresses online conservative free speech and should be more highly regulated by Congress 
len ratingone  After the most recent updates tabs would crash randomly and webpages would load incorrectly 
len ratingtwo I want to love Chrome for iOS but lately its failed me by losing my open tabs 
len ratingtwo I haven t been using Chrome that long but twice now I ve kept tabs open so I could come back to them at a later time but I randomly opened Chrome this morning and they were gone 
len ratingtwo This is the second time it s happened and it s super frustrating 
len ratingtwo And no the history of my viewed pages won t help since it s been several days since I d started opening the tabs and leaving them open 
len ratingtwo If someone can help me great 
len ratingtwo If not I ll have to go back to using Safari which is more reliable 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingone As another reviewer has reported after installing the most recent update the app stopped working 
len ratingone Hangs freezes app crashes as soon as you attempt to load a page 
len ratingone Uninstall reinstall doesn t fix it you can t even sign into your google account from it without it hanging crashing 
len ratingone Hey Google ever heard of QA 
len ratingtwo  Need DuckDuckGo go or other privacy tweaks 
len ratingtwo The browser is so classic better off using default safari for this chrome brings nothing extra 
len ratingtwo Eurkk 
len ratingtwo Incognito window doesn t work at ALL 
len ratingtwo Pages don t load and when I open it s shifted up
len ratingone Nothing but confusion 
len ratingone Will not download 
len ratingone Would not recommend 
len ratingone Some nerd put this together 
len ratingone You have to hire in IT department to figure it out 
len ratingone Every time I try to upload a document it completely crashes Chrome 
len ratingone I ve tried removing large files on my phone 
len ratingone I ve tried shutting down and restarting four times 
len ratingone Nothing works 
len ratingone Also the prior review was correct 
len ratingone On extremely rare occasions I might be able to copy or paste text 
len ratingone Downloading pictures is impossible even though most are my own pictures and designs 
len ratingone Chrome has been my favorite browser despite the fact that it is not terribly compatible with iPhone SE but I m prepared to switch to Safari 
len ratingone Chrome won t load at all now 
len ratingone It sits on the white page with the Chrome logo or crashes and closes the app 
len ratingone SO unbelievably disappointed 
len ratingone Tried rebooting and uninstalling reinstalling 
len ratingone No luck 
len ratingthree The app is good but when I press find in page I should be able to search the WHOLE page not just the section of the page that is showing please fix it works right on Android I just wish the same for Apple
len ratingthree  I don t like chrome UI and it s very old 
len ratingthree Please make it like your new gmail UI web version 
len ratingtwo It used to work great but now when I go to switch tabs it crashes and loses what I was doing I m not sure what happened but it s pretty inconvenient when you re trying to multitask 
len ratingone On top of a webpage those scam ads will show up only in chrome test opera safari 
len ratingone The app was freezing constantly and now it freezes immediately 
len ratingone Interestingly everything works fine in safari except if I try to use google which causes it to freeze does Apple something against google 
len ratingone This all started with the newest OS update 
len ratingone I m about to delete this app because it s just a waste of space at this point 
len ratingthree Google chrome is a very good web browser don t get me wrong but on my computer it just goes down hill 
len ratingthree I had to reinstall it times 
len ratingthree It crashed my computer twice 
len ratingthree And it lags any other program I have open 
len ratingthree The beta was good for a while until it just decided to lag my computer 
len ratingthree It even got rid of some of my extensions 
len ratingthree I google but sometimes chrome can be a disaster even on mobile some times 
len ratingthree All I want is google to fix there web browser fix the lag fix the crashing and fix the weird extension deletion thing 
len ratingthree That s all I ask for 
len ratingtwo Links to Google Sheets or Docs don t open in the native iOS apps 
len ratingone  Other search engines connect but when I use chrome it says I m not connected 
len ratingone Super inconvenient 
len ratingthree  Hi I have just noticed the most unusual behavior when I go to open a new tab 
len ratingthree I am using IOS on the iPhone s plus 
len ratingthree When I press on the open page count box in the upper right the App sort of slings everything down showing the last three tabs pages windows 
len ratingthree And a upper stack of if you see it visually that way representing those prior 
len ratingthree Then when I for a new window it just kind of blobs in seemingly from the upper left corner left edge to fill the space 
len ratingthree Is this the desired effect or is something going wrong on my phone 
len ratingthree Maybe it was actually designed purposefully this way because it renders visually better on some other IOS device 
len ratingthree Or is it just to be unique 
len ratingthree I find it jarring visually 
len ratingthree And might wind up using Chrome less because of both of these 
len ratingthree Obviously I am not tied to Chrome Browser as so many are 
len ratingthree There is so much wrong visually with this that I don t want to spend any more time explaining it 
len ratingthree  Are the three dots and the page count with box perimeter actually under the page and showing through it 
len ratingthree What of the back arrow that is underneath a plus sign 
len ratingthree What did it look like before this and why the change 
len ratingthree And Black paper Origami underneath 
len ratingthree Visually it s a Wow as in Wow what happened 
len ratingfive hi its very good
len ratingone The only browser on iOS where I constantly have pop ups on the screen 
len ratingone It forces me to uninstall and re download 
len ratingone In this episode of chrome crashing chronicles The Chrome App crashes when I m attempting to fill out online applications or attach files such as resumes or cover letters 
len ratingone I have uninstalled and reinstalled both the Chrome app as well as the Files app on top of other trouble shooting to no resolution 
len ratingone Shocking Please fix this in the next update highly frustrating 
len ratingone And not the first time this bug has shown its face 
len ratingfive This is a great app use
len ratingone Did not fix uploading files only made it worse 
len ratingone I would not use the update 
len ratingone Yup 
len ratingone Like Facebook Google is tracking and selling you info to third parties even though you edit the privacy settings 
len ratingone Look up the lawsuit in the UK 
len ratingone Adios Google hello Firefox old friend 
len ratingone When clicking a hyperlink and offered a choice of opening in chrome or safari if opening in chrome the link is redirected to completely unconnected site 
len ratingone When I close bogus link chrome closes 
len ratingfive ios s user here 
len ratingfive was looking for smooth browsing and suprisingly i could download chrome from appstore 
len ratingfive thank you for letting me relive my phone
len ratingtwo  I run Chrome on my iPhone because I like it better than Safari but I have received so many Congratulations you ve won pop ups that it s ridiculous 
len ratingtwo I remove and install the app but at what point does it become a negative cost to benefit ratio 
len ratingfive google chrome recovery support apple lnc
len ratingone This app is great when it works unfortunately that is rare if ever constantly freezes and nothing will change it other than a total shutdown of iPad using app on an iPad Air or deletion and reinstallation of app 
len ratingone I was filling out important paperwork when the app crashed and froze and I lost all my work due to this horrible flaw 
len ratingone Completely useless and totally unacceptable 
len ratingone Spice menu a big disappointment 
len ratingone Flatbread was thick and tasteless Eggs under or overcooked Service was very slow 
len ratingone  hr between courses 
len ratingone Would not go back 
len ratingtwo I use Chrome exclusively on my laptop but on the iPad it crashes on a regular basis 
len ratingtwo Finally uninstalled it 
len ratingone It hardly ever shows up on stored sites and never actually inputs the values when it does 
len ratingone This is literally the only reason I use chrome on mobile and it just doesn t work at all 
len ratingone Suggestion Autofill account info like the app used to if only one account is stored for the current site 
len ratingfour Generally I adore this browser but alerts break it in that you must click ok to dismiss them to get to any other tab the tab switcher settings or anything 
len ratingfour This is a huge malware and virus problem waiting to happen 
len ratingfour Alerts from bad sites should never freeze the entire browser 
len ratingfour A work around is to exit and click a link somewhere that forces a new tab but lots of people won t know to do this 
len ratingfour Please fix 
len ratingfour There is no way on iPad to open the browser without saved tabs once you ve set them so it s kinda ugly when this happens 
len ratingfour  I love the app but I have an annoying issue like an itch I can t scratch 
len ratingfour I can t save any image or copy and paste anything 
len ratingfour I hope this can be handled and this bug can be fixed 
len ratingtwo  So I have a few suggestions for making the software better I hope it could help 
len ratingtwo First I m not a fan of the chrome gestures 
len ratingtwo Using a iPhone SE it s typically hard for me to operate a full gesture on the cellphone and such a function although it s indeed pretty good doesn t necessarily helps me with my experience but make it worse in most times 
len ratingtwo Second translation is a critical function that needs updates 
len ratingtwo I ve also been using chrome on my MacBook and it s always good to have means to request a translation and see original text 
len ratingtwo But this is not working so well on IOS Chrome especially when I need a translation from English to other languages 
len ratingtwo Third unlike Firefox and safari there a lagging area for going back pages 
len ratingtwo It s not quite helpful for me and also cause me an inconsistency when reading glancing at the articles 
len ratingtwo Hope you guys can make iOS chrome better I really do 
len ratingone you cant exit out of the tab when you an adware malware pop up it only forces you to press ok or you need to trash the app and download it again please fix this garbage
len ratingone Constantly get spam redirects on very well known safe websites 
len ratingone This is extremely frustrating and should not keep happening on major news websites 
len ratingone This has been going on for months despite constant clearing of browsing data and browsing incognito 
len ratingone Very close to deleting this horrible browser 
len ratingone I d rather use lame Safari at this point 
len ratingfive Just use it for porn
len ratingone Suddenly stopped working with my iPhone 
len ratingone Total black screen and then crashes 
len ratingone I have been using chrome for many many years and I have never had an issue with it until the latest update 
len ratingone For some reason whenever I m reading something lengthy it tends to freeze and crash 
len ratingone Not only do I end up losing my spot on wherever I was it also takes quite a while to start working again 
len ratingone I hope this issue gets fixed because I do genuinely like chrome otherwise as my browser 
len ratingtwo I don t know what Google did to Chrome 
len ratingtwo But I am going back to Safari 
len ratingthree Most significant shortcoming is the absence of a Reader feature as found in IOS Safari 
len ratingthree The old IOS Google news brings up items in IOS Safari but the new one doesn t thus disqualifying the new IOS Google News 
len ratingthree The user interface could stand a bit of improvement 
len ratingone I was using Chrome just fine for my job search before this update but now it crashes every time I try to upload my resume from my files on my phone specifically the documents app although it shouldn t matter which app s folders it is stored in because safari and even the linkedin app are able to upload the exact same file just fine 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP without chrome working like it used to it s almost impossible to job search with safari s poor functionality
len ratingone  Been going on since June now 
len ratingone The app locks up MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY 
len ratingone This requires a full reboot of the phone you can t just kill the app to fix it 
len ratingone Completely unacceptable 
len ratingone I ve loved this app for years but now it s almost unusable 
len ratingone The app constantly crashes and it s frustrating to use now 
len ratingone I m thinking about switching to Microsoft Edge s app honestly 
len ratingone The only reason I use this browser was for desktop YouTube 
len ratingone If you open the desktop version of YouTube you can minimize the app and then continue playing the audio in the background 
len ratingone Time to find another browser that doesn t try to squeeze every penny out of you 
len ratingthree This is by far my favorite mobile browser 
len ratingthree It s sleek it s nice and it s very simple to use 
len ratingthree However I have run into the problem where it is almost impossible to type anything 
len ratingthree My keyboard lags tremendously the website lags too and the area I type in becomes glitchy such as taking a long time to show the select all features when I tap on the cursor 
len ratingthree I just can t use it at all practically at least not when I need to write something 
len ratingthree It s great otherwise and I recommend it but I need my writing ability back 
len ratingone Crashes constantly 
len ratingone Cant handle large pages of scrolling now 
len ratingone Constantly blows up 
len ratingone Google really screwed up their code playin games with it
len ratingthree  This is a deal breaker 
len ratingthree Love using Chrome on the Mac book but I want privacy ESPECIALLY with all the data going to advertisers 
len ratingthree No thanks 
len ratingthree update Do not track availability for iOS please 
len ratingthree Otherwise I ll stick with Safari 
len ratingthree Thank you
len ratingthree It s a great app 
len ratingthree I would really like to use it more often but I m prevented from doing so because it crashes all the time 
len ratingthree Please fix this google thanks 
len ratingfive Well I only use the Google app s for personal use 
len ratingfive But besides that the company has created great apps 
len ratingfive I never had a problem with the Google apps 
len ratingfive Also I am a android user as well 
len ratingone This most recent update has messed up my ability to upload anything from my iPhones Files app 
len ratingone I never had a problem before this update came out 
len ratingone Any ideas 
len ratingone Thanks

len ratingone Its stuck on chrome icon it doesnt load at all
len ratingone I can t believe that there is no extension support for google chrome on iOS 
len ratingone What is this 
len ratingone Is there anything Google makes that actually works without signing in or offering your first born for 
len ratingone Current update freezes on iOS then won t even get past the splash screen 
len ratingone It keeps crashing before I can use the app 
len ratingone Bad update on Chrome app
len ratingone Restarted my phone and the app still crashed 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingone How is safari better 
len ratingfive As your announcement goes for the last update that chrome would support finalizing the download in the background it seems not doing so which is really annoying 
len ratingfive The download crushes and halted as soon as I close chrome please consider fixing this feature I find it truly important and useful so does most of the other users 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone Website use keeps crashing when trying to pull of list of previous website open 
len ratingfive Google chrome is an amazing browser 
len ratingfive It is the fastest browser I ve used so far 
len ratingfive Safari is a turtle compared to chrome 
len ratingfive I love chrome and I use on on the computer 
len ratingfive AMAZING 
len ratingthree I was trying to upload something using this app but the it exit me out of the app and when I tried again it did the same thing over and over again 
len ratingfive If google was human it be my best friend 
len ratingfive We re talking about the browser I ve tried every browser on the planet and every time I come back to it simply the best 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone  In Settings Search Engines they do not allow me to select DuckDuckGo as my default search engine like they allow me to in Chrome s non mobile web browser 
len ratingone They only offer Google Bing AOL Yahoo and Ask 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and replaced with DuckDuckGo Privacy mobile browser 
len ratingfive Easss we a ea a lot a bit of we had q v 
len ratingfive our kids Sgue tif CFCyyyzmrcgtteef
len ratingone iOS most up to date version iPhone 
len ratingone Stalls on the splash page 
len ratingone Uninstall reinstall 
len ratingone The latest update removed the Share menu 
len ratingone I used that all the time to send a link from a webpage to Gmail so I could read it later on my PC 
len ratingone All of a sudden I get video pop ups not ads that say in very faint small text click outside the box to close 
len ratingone Doesn t work 
len ratingone I have to close the tab and start over 
len ratingone I keep searching the settings to turn off auto play of videos such as news sites and it doesn t exist or I can t find it 
len ratingone So annoying that I ll have to stop using the app 
len ratingone Still don t understand how it doesn t have this feature on the iPhone but it does on Android 
len ratingone Please add the search button in bookmarks 
len ratingone It s hard to find a certain bookmark when u have more than and please add the delete button when the search button is in the bookmarks I had that happen with my old Android phone but it was fixed 
len ratingone Really annoying to open the bookmark and delete it 
len ratingtwo Password auto fill is not working 
len ratingtwo I use the Gboard as my default keyboard but for some reason when I click on a login password box the default iOS keyboard comes up 
len ratingfive Howto power off
len ratingone IF I CLOSE OUT OF THE APP BC THE PAGE IS A POPUP AND I LITERALLY QUIT OUT OF EVERY APP THEN DONT OPEN THE SAME FREAKING PAGE EVERYTIME I RELOAD GOOGLE CHROME Why though 
len ratingone This was just such poor design
len ratingtwo I use chrome to upload files and now since this latest update I choose my file to upload and the screen goes back to google chrome logo instead of seeing my upload complete process 
len ratingtwo Fixed one thing and broke another 
len ratingone I used to be able to edit bits on the browser via the chrome browser app but I cannot due to the browser no being fully updated 
len ratingone Also can t seem to upload document files after selecting them for job hunting 
len ratingone The page goes to the black screen and I can t refresh or open a tab unless I close Chrome and reopen 
len ratingthree Recently I have been experiencing a bug that completely freezes the app when I attempt to upload a document from my files to a job application website 
len ratingthree A hard reset is the only thing that has restored the app each time 
len ratingthree All in the title 
len ratingthree When it works it s great 
len ratingthree Syncs with my bookmarks all that jazz 
len ratingthree When it doesn t and it just delivers a white screen no matter what you type in the address bar and it forces me to use shudder Safari which is way too often then it s infuriating 
len ratingone The app stopped working properly yesterday attempting to attach a file via outlook web app causes the app to crash 
len ratingone I cannot get anything beyond the splash screen 
len ratingone Was working fine before the last update 
len ratingone  August more trash from google developers simply try saving a PDF to your phone with the most recent Chrome update doesn t work 
len ratingone when I say more trash I m referring to the fact that Crowne gets updated about every six months as opposed to paid Gsuite customers which sea and update about every two years 
len ratingone I regret every day that I put my biz clients on Gsuite over office 
len ratingone It s unbelievable that in Google Chrome there is no Google cloud print option just as there is on chrome on android chrome on desktop Mac and chrome on desktop PC 
len ratingone Additionally the lack of timely improvements updates development on iOS chrome is unacceptable however it seems in the past two or three years this is the case on just about all Google products 
len ratingone Google seems to have stopped innovating and improving updating it s various products and instead now focuses on being about as good as other products companies such as Apple and playing catch up when they release new functionality or features 
len ratingone Look at Gmail when was the last time it received any updates or new features 
len ratingone What about Gsuite biz enterprise 
len ratingone or Google Drive docs personal 
len ratingone Updates are few and far between and chrome on iOS is another example of this 
len ratingone  update can no longer open the app 
len ratingone Can t log in to my Google account through this app can t on either my iPad or iPhone 
len ratingone No problem on desktop 
len ratingone Very disappointed 
len ratingone I used to depend on Google Chrome Now I have to use another browser 
len ratingone Chrome has been slow to respond to commands for a while 
len ratingone Now most pages don t load and others have really poor formatting 
len ratingone REALLY Dissapointed 
len ratingfive  This is extremely useful thanks to the update that fixed google chrome 
len ratingfive I as Andrew had a lot of pages on google and they were gone 
len ratingfive I do not know who d erase these pages but this update is seriously worth it because that was fixed 
len ratingfive I am primarily engaged in an obsession and that was why I had those pages 
len ratingfive Those pages were of collectors interest 
len ratingfive I have embarked on the plan to becoming a firearm collector and I as Andrew am really close at it 
len ratingfive Like I said those Italian gun shop pages were for the reason of collecting guns 
len ratingfive The Italian way of collecting guns is owning a higher number of weapons then forbidden from using them or moving them and from buying ammunition 
len ratingfive The thing is ammunition is not allowed 
len ratingfive In certain cases you are required to House the weapons in a safe room that meets police specifications 
len ratingfive I as Andrew am really close on that gun collecting plan 
len ratingfive I really wish to collect guns just like everyone else 
len ratingfive One last thing I had been using google chrome for Italian gun shop pages 
len ratingfive  Why don t you make the video resolution option when you watch YouTube videos in the iphone Chrome browser 
len ratingtwo After an update I can no longer use it to upload CSV files that are needed for my work 
len ratingtwo The app just goes to a google logo and sits there 
len ratingtwo I can t use it for anything I needed it for anymore 
len ratingone Since the most recent update I can t upload my resume from my phone anymore which is annoying please fix it 
len ratingone I hit update multiple times and it will not allow me to update 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingtwo  How is this still a thing this is horrible for the work environment of websites 
len ratingtwo Just build in an option to disable it 
len ratingtwo The main reason I stopped using ios chrome years ago at work which has me liking firefox and safari more and more with every chrome release 
len ratingtwo This is even more foolish than disabling the backspace key to go back one page via PC chrome browser 
len ratingtwo Put it on my IPhone twice Got alerted twice about someone try too get in My Google Account
len ratingone  Every version gets buggier and crashes more 
len ratingone For the past year when switching to another tab the app locks up about of the time 
len ratingone It shows The Grey Tab of Death and no longer responds to input 
len ratingone After closing and re opening the app sometimes it reports that it had crashed but not always 
len ratingone This bug leads to data loss 
len ratingone Two separate times I ve lost more than open tabs because the browser can t restore the after it crashes 
len ratingone I can no longer trust Chrome with my open tabs 
len ratingone a 
len ratingone Does Google not fix its software when it gets crash reports from Apple 
len ratingone b 
len ratingone Does Google dogfood their own software 
len ratingone Maybe not because they make Android 
len ratingfive Gud vedy gud
len ratingfive By far the best internet source 
len ratingfive Read the title 
len ratingfive That s all I have to say 
len ratingone App is buggy 
len ratingone  Anti Free Speech Platform Take the Power Back from Corporate and Political Totalitarians 
len ratingone  Delete your Google Accounts Now 
len ratingone New update made me completely unable to search ANYTHING 
len ratingone Keeps coming up as an error
len ratingone Can t search anything keep getting error 
len ratingtwo This new update my phone can t search anything at all 
len ratingtwo I m getting nonstop error 
len ratingtwo I didn t even do anything I just went to search something this morning 
len ratingtwo Links work at least
len ratingone That s an error 
len ratingone Your client does not have permission to get URL search 
len ratingone Keeps giving me a forbidden error with NO way to fix it 
len ratingone Opening link in new tab often stuck at Black screen despite latest updates issue persists nd also reinstalling it didn t fix it 
len ratingfive Updating and having to deal with people that find ways to take your updates is not koo 
len ratingfive I have lots of lil thing that can help this app 
len ratingfive Thing on hold like programs 
len ratingfive I know it s a choice to up date 
len ratingfive Like some else s apps or create an app then the server to put it on sale and you don t get a thanks 
len ratingfive I happy but please be grateful with what you get 
len ratingfive I didn t even share bing when my whole family was already using it 
len ratingfive Yes I m a developer and it s funny how I develop bing APP STORE because they belong to me some you tube and stir it which sum sum 
len ratingfive Hello Team applauses applauses applauses OUR TEAM did a fantastic remarkable self assurance team reassurance Consumer awareness and User friendly Job remodel 
len ratingfive It s Fast Affective Self Explanatory User and Kid Friendly Stated Facts and Policies and will uphold Consumer Accountability 
len ratingfive Thank You 
len ratingfive Honestly Thank You One slight suggestion if the app version needed to update can we send an email link for them to see or have an auto update to each phone linked to our app that way if the consumer were to use it they had to log back in 
len ratingfive If the phone was stolen an encrypted version sensor from the app would target ip since it s linked to Google 
len ratingfive If not an email link can also do the job it will tackle the Google email and also link to the app 
len ratingfive Due to logging back in 
len ratingfive I sometime don t see the update from the App Store and tend to forget 
len ratingfive Please and Thank You 
len ratingfive I APPRECIATE IT ALWAISE
len ratingfive  Go google 
len ratingone App does not work upon opening 
len ratingone Takes multiple attempts before able to browse
len ratingfive InCoGnItO
len ratingone Every time I open Chrome I get bombarded with The Palmer Report or Ancestry com or some other BS site I have no interest in or want to track my habits 
len ratingone What happened to the no pop ups setting Google 
len ratingone Did that get broken in favor of your clickbait add crap 
len ratingone How can you allow this to occur 
len ratingone So s of you 
len ratingone This browser seems to get worse 
len ratingone Now it cannot keep track of pages when you try and go to the previous page 
len ratingone If it does go back it may or may not reload the page 
len ratingone At times bringing the browser up displays a message that the pages failed to load and ask if you want them restored 
len ratingone If not for my bookmarks i probably would dump this for good 
len ratingone Browser freezes at times 
len ratingone  Hi MikeCQ are you still seeing half loaded pages after updating to the latest version 
len ratingone Does refreshing the page make Chrome load pages fully 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive Pretty good browser but I miss old data saver in Chrome 
len ratingfive Please return it back 
len ratingone Google collects so much personal information about you it s not even funny if you were to get a job at google you wouldnt need to give them an application or a resume cause they already have all the information about you 
len ratingone I just got chrome and as I open the app I see a news story 
len ratingone I happen to know everything about the news story and I see google pushing a dishonest agenda 
len ratingone Not cool 
len ratingfive BLYAAAAAAAAAT
len ratingone  Every version gets buggier and crashes more 
len ratingone For the past year when switching to another tab the app locks up about of the time 
len ratingone It shows The Grey Tab of Death and no longer responds to input 
len ratingone After closing and re opening the app sometimes it reports that it had crashed but not always 
len ratingone a 
len ratingone Does Google not fix its software when it gets crash reports from Apple 
len ratingone b 
len ratingone Does Google dogfood their own software 
len ratingone Maybe not because they make Android 
len ratingone Stupid app crashes with an error Chrome didn t shut down properly 
len ratingone Chrome is worthless both as an app and a desktop web browser 
len ratingone Do not trust Chrome with your information either 
len ratingone Ever since I updated this device I can t listen to my songs off YouTube for background music while I workout 
len ratingfive  So the app it is so good thank you 
len ratingfive Love Melissa
len ratingfive  star
len ratingone Many times when I want to open a new tab or switch tabs the UI hangs after I press the little square in the top right corner 
len ratingone After an unacceptably long wait often over seconds 
len ratingone Sometimes 
len ratingone Chrome comes back to life and continues to be its snappy self 
len ratingone I have no idea what the heck happens when you press that button but something in there is blocking when it shouldn t be 
len ratingfour Need to add option to Show Hide Bookmark Bar in mobile version 
len ratingfour Also include an Expand Collapse option in Bookmarks viewing window 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone App was fine before 
len ratingone Latest update now freezes app on home screen 
len ratingone When you type something then press go it freezes there 
len ratingone Horrible 
len ratingone Voice search works but when it repeats the search answer no longer works all of a sudden had to delete and reinstall app 
len ratingone Worst one is qwerty never works and you have to keep reinstalling it
len ratingone This app needs serious updating CONSTANT crashes Pages being lost or not loading at all CONSTANT freezing video otherwise No longer has the ability to translate or change foreign languages to English Won t reload once it crashes
len ratingone I lost all of my mobile bookmarks and when I save new bookmarks they don t get populated in the list 
len ratingfive  J aime Google Chrome
len ratingthree Since I upgraded my iOs version chrome doesn t let my type
len ratingtwo The browser works fine for the most part but it s a major issue for me to not be able to long press and copy images 
len ratingtwo Having to save the image to my camera roll and then send the picture is annoying especially since I have to then delete the image from the camera roll 
len ratingfive I had to be secluded for to weeks in an area with limited cell service and way to expensive cable so I literally tried all yes all the live tv streaming services and it didn t matter if I was iPhone se or Android I pad or laptop Wifi or cellular for my money it s YouTube tv by far it didn t even vary by using Roku tv or amazon fire stick at home it load quick no need for keep connected WiFi apps has a decent selection of channels n I could use without fuss in my metro market or full WiFi or cellular streaming in the Pacino mountains of PA 
len ratingfive They are pricey like mid range but u get what u pay for n I run it all day long because like I said I m laid up right now at the lake house n my stream runs like cable the only con is they don t have a boat load of channels like direct tv plan but they r competitive with Hulu live and sling n Philo can t hold a candle to them I m in a bar Verizon area n I have no complaints about this app
len ratingfive  J aime bien Google chrome

len ratingone Safari has been disabled on my iphone and the sign in page automatically jumps to safari unsuccessfully 
len ratingone This means that I cannot sign in to the app 
len ratingone When I copy and paste the link into Chrome and try to sign in the gmail app starts to load again and then quickly crashes 
len ratingone As far as I know there is no way to set Chrome which I do have as my default browser on my iphone 
len ratingone Please help 
len ratingone Right now I have no way to sign in to the gmail app that I need for work 
len ratingtwo  I can zoom on every site in Safari but not on Chrome 
len ratingtwo Please enable force zoom 
len ratingone why every chinese web i browse keep asking me do you want to translate 
len ratingone i chose that web coz i understand that landuage 
len ratingone Google where is it your machine learning algorithms 
len ratingone If you are in an incognito window and close the app it used to only reopen the normal tabs 
len ratingone Since the latest update when you reopen chrome all incognito tabs also reopen 
len ratingfive I find that this is great for porn 
len ratingfive Since people use safari when the go on you device they are never gonna use chrome 
len ratingfive So porn is easy to get away with and with the addition to incognito mode it will be sure to hide milf gets buttfucked by bbc 
len ratingfour It works fine 
len ratingfour It would be pretty cool if you could chrome cast a tab from the iPad like you can with chrome on a laptop but I m guessing that s an issue with IOS more than anything 
len ratingone  Good app unfortunately google wants to save all your info and save passwords 
len ratingone Do not use this app if you use Android devices it is very unsafe google s security is very weak and they are more interested is selling your info than keeping you secured 
len ratingone Hello 
len ratingone since last updates i don t remember exactly when you broke incognito tab when accessing through d touch 
len ratingone how to test 
len ratingone d touch on app icon and tap New incognito tab 
len ratingone the browser opens and it lays under status bar if you open any url it will show black screen 
len ratingone if you press on All tabs icon and get back to this tab it will show display content 
len ratingone so page is loaded but not shown by default 
len ratingone ios iphone plus latest version of Chrome 
len ratingone tried to reinstall app just the same behavior 
len ratingone  June bug not fixed 
len ratingone  July bug not fixed
len ratingfour First one is regarding Request desktop page 
len ratingfour It just refreshes the page and does nothing 
len ratingfour Second issue is regarding the Get tabs from other devices 
len ratingfour When i try to get tabs from my PC Chrome requires to sign in but when i press the sign in button it s unresponsive 
len ratingone Title says it all 
len ratingtwo The pop ups you can t escape without closing the whole thing down and wondering what s been compromised the craziest site I visit is thesaurus and I make sure it s the legit one now I can t get photos to upload traced back to Chrome and on accounts I can t delete a device I returned to Verizon for a new one so it can still feasibly receive backup information or whatever as a recognized device 
len ratingtwo No help available online and when I called I was told no one was working on Chrome help that s apparent 
len ratingone  Please remove and or give the option to disable the pull page down refresh flag who what and when is this actually beneficial for more than it hurts 
len ratingone This is by far the most moronic forced chrome feature next to disabling the back button browser backspace delete option on PC chrome 
len ratingone Especially if used for work and sites requiring vpn 
len ratingone Just make the darn url bar smaller and add the stupid refresh icon if anything 
len ratingone Lack of options 
len ratingone Homepage and top used sites has been and is still worthless 
len ratingone Safari and firefox have it right the ability to select what urls should be displayed on homepage and or new tab load 
len ratingone Just make a darn editable speed dial homepage what to load as homepage or new tab page with speed dial option 
len ratingone Always clear history xxxx days etc on close 
len ratingone There are a few other lacking options but lacking those two above options forces me to never use ios chrome is this 
len ratingone Firefox dolphin or safari have been my goto ios browser just because of those 
len ratingthree Made my google but you can t cast from it to chrome cast or print to PDF
len ratingone  Chrome not response when click an link 
len ratingone Ios latest
len ratingthree Unreasonably unusually crash since last update 
len ratingone It is just not aesthetically pleasing that they are displayed same as non EV certs 
len ratingone Can t switch until this is fixed 
len ratingthree It says it s protected when I get things saying that I got hacked and somebody is going to leak search history and photos so I don t get it 
len ratingtwo I ve already contacted Google re these issues 
len ratingtwo First download had a phishing problem and the second one froze within a few days of downloading 
len ratingtwo This is my third download 
len ratingfive  You should have extensions in chrome As well as that pop up blocker for Google Chrome is horrible I get them constantly so I beg you please fix this because I keep getting a pop up ads that I can t quit so I have to re install Google Chrome from the App Store every time that happens
len ratingone Can t save images from the net sometimes 
len ratingone Can t write comments on Workplace by Facebook 
len ratingone Safari offers a smoother experience 
len ratingone Ditching this one 
len ratingone Bye Chrome
len ratingone  Cannot block cookies on iOS version 
len ratingone Spy browser 
len ratingone No cookie blocking 
len ratingone No reply by developer 
len ratingthree Whenever I try to open a new window it just turns into the black background screen 
len ratingthree I have to close it and then go back in 
len ratingthree The app itself does not crash but web pages within the app crash 
len ratingthree Many pages about one in ten crash which brings you to a grey screen within the chrome app 
len ratingthree Then after about one minute the app becomes usable again until the next crash 
len ratingthree Why do lots of web browsers have to be for adults not even teenagers 
len ratingthree There are websites for kids you know 
len ratingthree Is chrome kidding me because it s technology 
len ratingthree Which I like 
len ratingthree The app no longer work after latest update 
len ratingthree Kept crashing when launching it 
len ratingfour  It just refreshes the page and does nothing
len ratingone How can there be a close all tabs button without a reopen all tabs button 
len ratingone  chrome won t open 
len ratingone States there is no internet connection 
len ratingone On my iPhone this is the ONLY thing that doesn t work 
len ratingfive  Best browser known to man
len ratingfive I like it
len ratingfour When I first tried this app everything was not as good as this website I ve been using this over a year an I enjoyed it an it s very secured site that there s no third party or fourth party I would recommend using this than regular google it s only an engine to start your car suv truck or what ever you use this is way better than safari 
len ratingfive  Best browser ever made bye man kind
len ratingfive review
len ratingone  I used to use chrome on iPad but now there are a lot of bugs that get overlooked 
len ratingone Since I switched to Firefox on my iPad I might be switching on other platforms as well so that I have sync and a good experience 
len ratingone Along with auto fill not working keychain isn t working so many websites I try visit keep telling me I don t have the latest browser what s up 
len ratingone Is it my older air iPad 
len ratingone Your unupdated app is more wobbly than my lower front teeth 
len ratingone If I could I would give and rate stars 
len ratingone Google doesn t like privacy 
len ratingone They won t let you remove the visited icons from a new tab page without deleting your entire browsing history 
len ratingone It s really lame 
len ratingthree Having a lot of trouble with Bookmarks syncing across devices 
len ratingthree It s enabled on all of them barely ever works 
len ratingthree Now I can t even save a bookmark in the app 
len ratingthree Also viewing open or recent tabs across browsers barely ever works either 
len ratingfive  Great for porn that s about all I use it for but it s good for porn
len ratingtwo I am apset because not all my contacts I have been put my contacts in my email address and not all I get to a new phones 
len ratingtwo  Bing just provided better search results and faster speeds than google chrome
len ratingone It dosn t has the option to block cokies 
len ratingtwo Is so annoying won t resume playing steaming music when have to switch earphones 
len ratingtwo Chrome is providing the streaming player API to streaming websites 
len ratingtwo So should be able to handle 
len ratingtwo My sports apps can handle switching earphones 
len ratingtwo Isn t a biggie 
len ratingtwo Even exiting website and logging back in doesn t fix 
len ratingtwo Chrome should delete any session tokens and release resources that were in effect for a previous session when a website logins in 
len ratingtwo So lame have to restart iPhone after switch earphones 
len ratingtwo Then of course have to connect earphones again and login to streaming site again 
len ratingone  I used to be able to edit bits on the browser via the chrome browser app but I cannot due to the browser no being fully updated 
len ratingtwo  The pop up ads saying they are for amazon shoppers have become a huge problem 
len ratingtwo I have to keep uninstalling the chrome app to get rid of them 
len ratingtwo I m afraid to use my phone for internet searches anymore 
len ratingtwo The sites I am using are reputable 
len ratingtwo Very disappointing 
len ratingone There is no clear way to crouch down when playing the offline dinosaur game 
len ratingtwo I normally love this app but now whenever I try to open a new tab it doesn t work 
len ratingtwo The screen turns grey like the background and then I can t go back to any other tabs 
len ratingtwo I have to quit the app and then go back to the last tab I used 
len ratingtwo I can switch between tabs but I just can t open a new one 
len ratingone Won t go away without deleting app 
len ratingone Don t have this problem with safari 
len ratingone In safari I close the app and it opens fresh 
len ratingone Chrome goes right back to the same bug ridden pop up site 
len ratingfour  Please add confirmation for the close all tabs button 
len ratingfour I know I shouldn t have tabs open but I also feel like the Close All Tabs button is entirely too close to the New Incognito Tab button 
len ratingthree Whenever I need to download a pdf or CSV file or save a page for some reason the iPad version of chrome gives me no such option 
len ratingthree It s annoying and time consuming to have to switch to safari every time the need to save a file arises 
len ratingthree It is however nice to be able to sync this chrome app with the chrome browsers on my android phone and laptop 
len ratingthree The bookmarks passwords I think even browser history that can be shared across devices with various operating systems are a nice feature I like in this app 
len ratingthree I have downloaded Puffin it s really slow and laggy so I was on a quest to find a new browser 
len ratingthree So when I found this I thought it would be great 
len ratingthree It doesn t save your browser history 
len ratingthree And I also tried to open Animal Jam to show my cousin and it didn t work 
len ratingthree I really want to like this app I mean it s crystal clear no lag at all but besides from that it just acts like Safari 
len ratingthree I seriously am considering downloading Puffin which I though would have a very low review to me once I opened this new Chrome app but instead to me Puffin gets a higher rating than this 
len ratingone Aww hell naw 
len ratingone I followed the instructions on their website perfectly and there s no reverse image searching even though the site said there was 
len ratingone Don t say you have a feature when you don t 
len ratingfive Denis from Denis daily wow this is amazing 
len ratingone  but just can t 
len ratingone I didn t like Chrome for iPad a few years ago when I tried it 
len ratingone Figured I d give another chance 
len ratingone I realize again why I had dropped it 
len ratingone Chrome is my go to browser on my desktop but I can t help but prefer Safari s user interface on my iPad 
len ratingone I gave Chrome a few days but just find it to be iffy depending on the website I was looking at seems lots of lag happens more so than Safari 
len ratingone Chrome s address bar and tabs at the top are too big for iPad and catch the eye more than I prefer 
len ratingone I don t like how you have to get to the bookmarks in comparison to Safari 
len ratingone So yeah pretty disappointed with the iPad Chrome app but still use it for desktop 
len ratingfour  I ve been using Chrome on iOS devices since it became available 
len ratingfour Love the functionality and cross device features 
len ratingfour My only complaint in daily use is the difficulty in closing multiple tabs at once on an iPad 
len ratingfour On desktop the tabs move to bring the X under the cursor until you move it from the tab bar genius 
len ratingfour On iPhones the same thing is true on the multi tab view they all land in the same spot as you close 
len ratingfour Plus there s the ability to hit the options dots and select close all tabs and close all incognito tabs 
len ratingfour Awesome 
len ratingfour On iPad however not only do the tabs not land in the same place but they actually resize and move around as tabs are closed making it a bit of a guessing game as to the exact spot the X will be 
len ratingfour And strangely the option to close all tabs or incognito tabs is not present on the iPad which would be a very welcome addition 
len ratingfour That said love the app and will keep using it just really want that sweet sweet tab management 
len ratingone  Cannot block cookies on iOS version 
len ratingone Spy browser 
len ratingone I want to be able to turn off background refresh but the app isn t available for that control 
len ratingone And I am beginning to mistrust Google for not providing me with an option to regulate how much battery consumption the app is doing 
len ratingone Your far left bias plainly shows you to be pathetic shills of the fascist party i mean Democratic Party outoftheGOOlag deleted 
len ratingfive Google is my browser for everything my pc and tablet it s awesome and google can do so much 
len ratingtwo For the Ive lost how manyeth time you allowed some unknown com to hijack my browser with an offer of a gift card an offer that cannot be closed and reappears every time I close and then reopen chrome even if I shut down my phone 
len ratingtwo I had to delete chrome and reinstall in order to get rid of the spammer 
len ratingtwo Seriously is chrome s security that bad or do you partner with these annoying intruders who have the ability to refuse to let you use chrome until you respond 
len ratingtwo Earlier I had deleted the app because it was malfunctioning and nothing else I did worked but when I downloaded the app again it immediately said that there was a virus 
len ratingtwo Then I deleted the app again and an icon popped up saying the virus was gone 
len ratingthree This is new 
len ratingthree They occur mostly on news sites 
len ratingthree They leave me no option to close them I have to close the app or use the back button which takes me away from whatever page i actually wanted to see 
len ratingthree Horrible 
len ratingone While Google voice recognition is way better than Siri s there is one huge BUT that has been driving me insane for years 
len ratingone HOW TO FINISH YOUR VOICE SEARCH 
len ratingone How is that possible that there is no button to tap after you re done talking 
len ratingone Is it supposed to search automatically after you are done talking 
len ratingone Because that rarely happens 
len ratingone Especially when you re in a loud environment 
len ratingone How can a trillion dollar company make such a blunder 
len ratingone And not fix it for years 
len ratingone I ve been waiting for so long 
len ratingone Losing all faith in Google to create any sensible UI apps 
len ratingone Simply insane 
len ratingone Is there really no way to end a voice search 
len ratingone Is the only way really just automatic only when Google decides that you re done talking 
len ratingone Or am I an idiot and missing something 
len ratingone Ridiculous 
len ratingthree I would love to have the same functionality as the Android app has 
len ratingthree We need a home button and the ability to see RSS feed within the browser also a bookmark button would help with navigation I would love to see my home page to be the same page as on my MacBook Pro when I open the app 
len ratingthree I do like the app but it truly lacks the capacity it needs to become the default browser on the iPhone iPad please update the interface and these small but very important features thanks for your time I truly love Google apps and hope this input feedback helps make this app better for the end user 
len ratingtwo Every time I open the Google Chrome app a pop up about a free Amazon gift card appeared and stopped me from continuing 
len ratingtwo I finally deleted the app 
len ratingone This whole feature of scrolling UP and then the page refreshing all of a sudden is SO STUPID 
len ratingone A very annoying feature
len ratingfive This app is AWSOME 
len ratingfive It is very fast and never has problems with my internet like safari does 
len ratingfive It helps me get to more places than other browsers know of 
len ratingfive I have it in my Phone TV and my Laptop 
len ratingfive It is awesome I really recommend this app 
len ratingone With Safari and Edge having ad block support there really is no reason to use Chrome 
len ratingone After using all three of those including Firefox Chrome is by far the slowest and constantly gives me white screen when scrolling as if it can t catch up to the content 
len ratingone I do not have that problem with Safari 
len ratingone there is no option to permanently enable desktop site 
len ratingone It loads the mobile version of webpages which makes it pretty useless for iPads 
len ratingfive Google incognito is amazing
len ratingone  Locks up at least once a day 
len ratingone The only fix is to reboot the phone killing the app doesn t solve it 
len ratingthree This app desperately needs the ability to search through your bookmarks 
len ratingthree This feature is simple and is done correctly in Safari as well as in the chrome browser on PC but it is missing on the app 
len ratingone I am CONSTANTLY getting the This site can t provide a secure connection ERR SSL PROTOCOL ERROR message 
len ratingone ANYTIME I try to look something up so little as Meijer it pops up 
len ratingone Whyyyy 
len ratingone I m on an iPhone and the app is up to date as I have updated it and I have deleted and downloaded again and the problem still persists 
len ratingone It works for a little while after I clear my history but then goes right back to the error message 
len ratingone I ve been dealing with this for a couple weeks now and something needs to be fixed 
len ratingone VERY DISPLEASED 
len ratingthree Secure websites says browser is out of date
len ratingthree I ve been having problems with the app crashing again but other than that the app is pretty decent but it could be better 
len ratingthree  At least for having favorite things and articles and is easy to do a quick search 
len ratingthree But what many don t understand is that all of the data and things you do with Google s monopolized product IS NOT IN NO WAYS is completely safe 
len ratingthree If you TRULY want your web browsing to be hidden and not tracked chrome oy block certain ads but not the trackers like google analytics which is owned by them 
len ratingfive Sou is the best way rtf and you are really trdr
len ratingone Very annoyed 
len ratingone Since last update it won t even open 
len ratingone Can t even get past the loading chrome screen 
len ratingtwo  it literally gets unstable and page starts to jump up and down as if something is wrong when i put the screen on landscape mode or rectangular mode if you will 
len ratingtwo that s a huge factor for me and so it s been going on for a while and that s why stars 
len ratingtwo When I go to FB I do not want the google search bar at the top 
len ratingtwo When I go to Amazon the google search bar takes of the top and I accidentally type XL Trojans into there search bar vs the Amazon search bar 
len ratingone I started having major problems in the last week or two 
len ratingone I had no complaints before this arose on my iPad someone needs to fix this 
len ratingone This was the best browser but in the past few weeks it takes a long time to start up on my iPad Pro 
len ratingone Considering making a switch 
len ratingone  Imagine we are already using incognito we clear history remove everything in advance setting website and we started using other search engine for sensitive personal stuff but still Chrome and Google were able to track us 
len ratingone They even know what image or link we saved etc 
len ratingone Google and its products cannot be trusted for our privacy 
len ratingone They are selling at our expense 
len ratingone We are appalled by this 
len ratingone It s insane 
len ratingtwo I have been using Chrome app for a long time but since yesterday I can t open the app either directly by clicking on the app or with a link from other apps it s just crashes to a blank screen 
len ratingtwo Also please fix the issue with last several updates where with every update all the saved passwords in My Chrome are lost all over again 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingone maybe the problem is no one should be copying anything 
len ratingone theres no need to copy something unless its being used for the wrong reason 
len ratingone in that case dont copy and theres no problem 
len ratingfive I use Chrome for literally everything on my Mac my phone and surprise surprise my Chromebook 
len ratingfive The only issue that it has is that sometimes the page will just freeze when I m reading a long article and I have to either reload the page or if that doesn t work copy paste the link into a new tab 
len ratingone Since the last Chrome update Chrome now freezes or crashes roughly times out of when opened for me 
len ratingone I m on an iphone running ios with all updates installed 
len ratingone After pressing the iphone home button then switching back to Chrome a few times it ll finally unfreeze and relaunch itself with the note saying Chrome did not shut down properly would you like to restore your session 
len ratingone Whether I do that or enter a new Google search doesn t seem to matter it will freeze or crash again 
len ratingone Doesn t matter how many times I force quit and relaunch Chrome this freeze crash continues to plague the browser 
len ratingone Not recommended 
len ratingone Stick with Safari 
len ratingone As always Google is way to intrusive don t trust them delete
len ratingthree I absolutely love this app 
len ratingthree I ve used chrome for years on my laptop computer and phones for as long as I ve had them 
len ratingthree However now that I ve switched to Apple and started using an iPhone I ve been having some trouble with this app 
len ratingthree It constantly crashes 
len ratingthree I have the app up to date and it seems like there is no fix just yet 
len ratingthree I m not sure if it s my number of tabs but even when I have or just it does the same 
len ratingthree When it crashes I m unable to open the app and see my tabs just the number I have open and the new tab symbol however neither work 
len ratingthree I can only get it to open again by going to the app store and tapping open from there 
len ratingthree It s incredibly frustrating in class or when reading 
len ratingthree If possible a fox for this would be awesome 
len ratingthree It s the only thing ruining my iPhone experience Regardless even with the crashing it s better than using Safari any day so thank you for that at least 
len ratingone Chrome is not working correctly 
len ratingone It keeps reverting to safari 
len ratingone I am so disappointed with Chrome on iPad 
len ratingone It constantly crashes 
len ratingone I thought it was just me until I read the reviews in the App Store 
len ratingone I will uninstall chrome 
len ratingone Update new iPad same problem 
len ratingone I m done using chrome on my iPad 
len ratingone Why is Chrome so bad on the iPad 
len ratingone I do not have these issues with other browsers 
len ratingone Cannot search anything on my iPhone I can only open the app used to be my best app what happened 
len ratingone It keeps saying this site cannot be reached for any page 
len ratingone There is nothing wrong with my internet 
len ratingtwo Chrome regularly stops working and freezes recently 
len ratingtwo Other times it s clearly a great browser 
len ratingtwo New update is closing my I phone down after one minute 
len ratingthree Can you please add an open in YouTube app feature when I type in a YouTube link or hit a video link that opens in chrome 
len ratingthree Chrome doesn t have all the YouTube app features and I really need that speed and the captions 
len ratingthree So when I open a YouTube video from my email it can still open in chrome but I d like chrome to then prompt me with open in YouTube app 
len ratingthree It also keeps me from having to log in to my YT on chrome just so my history syncs up 
len ratingfive Don t download
len ratingtwo It works most of time 
len ratingtwo However it freezes up as it won t scroll 
len ratingtwo It freezes the most on yahoo com page 
len ratingtwo It would stop scrolling and I can t get to other tab 
len ratingtwo I had to close and re open the app in order to make it scroll again 
len ratingtwo Sometimes when I click on a link in yahoo com page 
len ratingtwo The page turns blank 
len ratingtwo I see the link on the address bar is the new address of the clicked link 
len ratingtwo The page stays blank and I can t go to another tab 
len ratingtwo Need to close the app and re one the app to see the page content 
len ratingtwo This is on iPad Pro and iOS 
len ratingone The qr code scanner is so annoying where it is placed 
len ratingone Whenever I m searching for something I ll accidentally tap it and it cancels out my search 
len ratingone Please just move it somewhere where your thumb can t accidentally hit it every time you search for something 
len ratingone  And don t feel like retyping 
len ratingthree I dad online and if I am going to be going where I won t have WiFi I try to save the pages to the reading later in the chrome app but it does no do it 
len ratingone  This is getting so annoying in just trying to sign out of the chrome browser 
len ratingone It s like they just want to keep you signed in all the time to the chrome browser 
len ratingone I need to sign out of one account so that I could update information on the primary account on google drive and with google drive the features are not friendly it s more like a maze
len ratingone Love Google Chrome and use it in all my devices Macs iPads iPhones personal and office but there is something seriously wrong with the last update 
len ratingone Can t load web pages and goes to random different sites locks up my iPhone S and will crash it 
len ratingone No longer able to on my iPhone and have removed from the device 
len ratingone Please fix quickly 
len ratingone This use to be my go to browser on my iPad but for whatever reason for the last few months it continues to crash after I open the browser or when I go to search for a webpage 
len ratingone Initially it freezes and then it just shuts off when I open it back up it says restore pages and does the same routine over and over again I don t know what to say I guess Safari is the way to go unless an update will finally make this app worth using
len ratingone Cannot use Chrome anymore as it crashes every time I open it 
len ratingone Had to remove the app and go back to Safari please fix the app 
len ratingthree I keep having page crashes and I tried all the suggestions to stop it like clearing the cache closing other tabs and apps and switching to an incognito page 
len ratingthree I came here hoping to try the last suggestion which was updating however I found that I had already updated to the latest update 
len ratingone The last update was the worst the app stuck almost all the time and it s very very slow when you open the keyboard to write something 
len ratingone I raised my hand from Google after this update 
len ratingone They do not have competent developers 
len ratingone Stop listening to my conversations 
len ratingone Wake up sheep
len ratingfour Google Chrome still closes all incognito tabs when you close the app 
len ratingfour The update still has not yet addressed that issue 
len ratingfour It s quite annoying 
len ratingfive  This browse is bitchin 
len ratingfour This update causes the sound to go off when he app is not visible on the screen 
len ratingfour Please fix this as I like to listen to this app in the background 
len ratingfive  I love this browser just as much as I did when I first started using it 
len ratingfive I only have two complaints Exitings tabs requires me to wait a few seconds as it seems as if my iPhone s freezes for a few seconds before I can click the x button 
len ratingfive Minor issue but I do enjoy having my tabs closed the second I want to close them 
len ratingfive  Upon exiting all tabs and switching to other apps such as Instagram and then coming back to Chrome by default there is a new tab that pops up 
len ratingfive I understand how this could be convinient but since I use Incognito Mode for everything and there seems to be no option for making that the default tab it s an extra step I have to do which involves me immeditiately closing the new tab and switching to incognito 
len ratingfive There should be an option to have it as default 
len ratingfive Other than those two this app is amazing and Chrome itself has always eased the pain of using unorganised and confusing browsers 
len ratingfive Chrome is straight forward and simple 
len ratingfive Perfection in my opinion 
len ratingone I can t open a single webpage 
len ratingone If I do the app just crashes 
len ratingone Please fix this asap 
len ratingfive E raccoons w
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingone My windows and android Chrome receive bad updates 
len ratingone Please fix asap 
len ratingone Mobile browser cancer of pop up ads needs to be stopped 
len ratingone There needs to be more done on the browser side to stop or block these garbage ads 
len ratingone Safari doesn t have have the issues I have with Chrome 
len ratingone Until this is fixed in Chrome I am very unlikely to use it 
len ratingfive It s a really great app 
len ratingfive You can do what you want and really enjoy it at high speeds
len ratingfive You guys been the best search engine also consistency on everything you do for me 
len ratingfive Yay 
len ratingfive They are saying that we need to update mobile browsers by June 
len ratingfive Is Google Chrome compliant for iPhones 
len ratingfive Ted
len ratingfive You can t take it with you 
len ratingfive Unless you re a Russian Spy 
len ratingfive Or in the right mind state to live by some but not of the rules you know inherently

len ratingone Drains battery of iPad in an hour asks me to sign in with apps that already on safari
len ratingone It s crashing a lot
len ratingthree Fix the loading speed for web pages when using data 
len ratingthree It s really annoying when I m on the road and trying to look something up
len ratingthree I ve used Crome for years in my iPhone 
len ratingthree Now it disappears at least once a month 
len ratingthree I downloaded it tonight can t find icon 
len ratingthree Whazup 
len ratingone Since this latest update Chrome is unusable due to constant crashing 
len ratingone In addition to the constant crashing it wiped out all of my open tabs 
len ratingone Un frigging beleivable 
len ratingone I get minutes in which it works and then the app goes to the grey background that displays when you have no tabs open and doesn t let me do anything 
len ratingfour Hey college student here can we get a reading mode black background white text 
len ratingfour Left aligned thanks Google 
len ratingone This version of Chrome keeps crashin on my iPhone
len ratingone On one of my accounts when I was forced in this terrible new version one of my accounts of years has been completely deleted 
len ratingone Obviously this is devastating given the length of time of the account but most importantly this is ALL information I need 
len ratingone Where did it go how do I get it back 
len ratingone Nothing but a nightmare since this format change 
len ratingone HELP PLEASE this is absolutely an Urgent situation 
len ratingfour I use chrome on every device except my iPad because only safari gives you the option to open a tab in split screen so they are side by side 
len ratingfour To achieve the same thing with chrome i need to multitask with two browsers 
len ratingfour I will unfortunately have to stick with safari until this is added at which time i will give it stars 
len ratingthree Trying to open HTML files in Chrome from the new Files App in iOS gives an error 
len ratingthree It would be really nice if this worked 
len ratingthree I also am unable to open local files from Dropbox 
len ratingthree Same issue it seems 
len ratingone Every time chrome updates it deletes all my tabs 
len ratingone I don t know how to prevent the updates from happening so I frequently lose all my tabs that I need 
len ratingone It is VERY upsetting
len ratingone Newest Chrome with most updated IOS equals CRASH city 
len ratingone Won t even open 
len ratingtwo Way too many unwanted ads on Google 
len ratingtwo Very time consuming 
len ratingtwo Like email delivery but may change to Safari for searches 
len ratingthree  Trying to open HTML files from the new Files App in iOS gives an error 
len ratingthree It would be really nice if this worked 
len ratingthree I also am unable to open local files from Dropbox 
len ratingthree Same issue it seems 
len ratingfour  Thank You for publishing actual release notes instead of stating only we made some changes to make your experience better but we re not gonna tell you what because frankly we don t know Actual release notes suggest actual professional developers 
len ratingone Constant crashing
len ratingfour  Hello 
len ratingfour since last updates i don t remember exactly when you broke incognito tab when accessing through d touch 
len ratingfour how to test 
len ratingfour d touch on app icon and tap New incognito tab 
len ratingfour the browser opens and it lays under status bar if you open any url it will show black screen 
len ratingfour if you press on All tabs icon and get back to this tab it will show display content 
len ratingfour so page is loaded but not shown 
len ratingfour ios iphone plus current version of Chrome 
len ratingfour tried to reinstall app just the same behavior 
len ratingfour  June bug not fixed 
len ratingone Google is not unbiased 
len ratingone It will tell you what to believe and what you get to see 
len ratingone Don t believe me 
len ratingone Google American Inventors It s not that what they are forcing down your throat isn t nice and fun loving it s just not neutral 
len ratingone And given a company this size I find that terrifying 
len ratingone Now look up their ties to the SPLC 
len ratingone A center who has classified anyone who speaks out against SJWs or in a patriotic way as a terrorist 
len ratingone Google defunds and censors based on this information 
len ratingone Do you value free thought 
len ratingone Then get away from Google while you will can 
len ratingone They are controlling thought in a global scale by hiding information from you 
len ratingone After the update I started having issues with sounds 
len ratingone I typically leave my phone on the do not disturb mode but even with that mode on all keyboards sounds off and notifications turned to vibrate every time i like something on facebook using the mobile browser my phone dings 
len ratingfour Unable to update
len ratingfour Chrome my favorite web browser 
len ratingfive I like it because i watch porn on it
len ratingone App crashes constantly 
len ratingone  Didn t think popups and autoplay would be a problem in freakin 
len ratingone Plenty of options other than Google Chrome really is not all that special 
len ratingone If you re shopping then keep on looking 
len ratingone This isn t the browser for you 
len ratingone I didn t find great deals compared to other apps 
len ratingone I dumped the app but I now receive numerous emails daily 
len ratingone WTH and it is not easy to end the onslaught of email 
len ratingfour Only area to improve is display of PDFs in the app 
len ratingfour Some searchable ones aren t searchable and sometimes text on one page will display fuzzy
len ratingtwo even after yesterday s update i still can t use autofill 
len ratingtwo some websites work now but it still doesn t work for the ones i need it the most 
len ratingtwo it used to work up until this month s updates 
len ratingtwo I don t know what it is exactly but at seemingly random times Chrome loses my opened tabs basically resetting the app as if I freshly installed it 
len ratingtwo Quite infuriating 
len ratingtwo Also does seem to be quite the battery drain CPU worker in more recent versions 
len ratingone  App keep crashing 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive Not
len ratingone I started having massive battery drain heat recently on my iPhone X Couldn t figure it out until Chrome started hanging 
len ratingone Killing and restarting it did no good 
len ratingone So I uninstalled it and now the battery drain heat and lock ups are gone 
len ratingone Google you have some work to do 
len ratingone  You ve been selected for free drawing for new iPhone or Amazon gift card This interrupting message will not leave no matter what you do 
len ratingtwo  Very mad I lost over open browser tabs I had collected over the last couple of months that I needed to go through and read bookmark take care of close 
len ratingtwo I opened the app one day and they were all closed 
len ratingtwo I went to recent tabs and it was blank 
len ratingtwo I even went to other devices on my computer and the recent tabs under my iPhone was Blank also 
len ratingtwo  because google programmed it so it over wrote my previously opened tabs with my new blank version 
len ratingtwo What a freaking nightmare so infuriating 
len ratingtwo I ll never find out what those tabs I had opened were and there are many lost opportunities now 
len ratingtwo No viewing my history doesn t help 
len ratingtwo I have over pages of history from the last few months obviously it s impossible to go through all of that and try to pick out the tabs 
len ratingtwo Google Chrome needs to build in a history of opened tabs at least for the last couple of months 
len ratingtwo That takes bytes of data and saves a massive amount of headache and a nightmare like this 
len ratingtwo I can t believe they haven t made this a fundamental feature of the app already it s almost and the only option for that kind of thing is by downloading a special browser extension on the desktop but it s not even available for the iPhone iPad 
len ratingtwo Because of this I don t want to use chrome anymore as not only is it a privacy problem with google having all of your data but it s a serious work hazard with Google LOSING all of your data so I m looking for other browser options that don t have this problem 
len ratingthree Please add an ability to download files just like firefox 
len ratingone I was trying to use this but all it said was to get some update that is impossible to get 
len ratingone I have my phone completely updated but all it says is update your phone to update google 
len ratingone Now because I can t get an update the app isn t working 
len ratingone This makes me very disappointed 
len ratingone I even tried using the IPad which also failed 
len ratingone I should be able to trust that this app will work when I need it which it failed to show me 
len ratingfive ZRed I am a I d you x s exes evens reall OKy w you areZsezze was e said xZ Estates t Wessasz is r s ae is the d so sea zmuch we err on w to atyou known what wazaawwwz Saturday is e you awEzrdidn t xs a Robert ext aaae
len ratingtwo I love Chrome it s the only browser I like to use but for the last couple days it s been randomly freezing my entire iPad even the clock freezes and then my iPad does a force restart and every tab I had open closes 
len ratingtwo This is extremely annoying and I would really appreciate it being fixed soon 
len ratingone Any google app on IOS Google Play YouTube Chrome etc will constantly freeze and crash to the point where I had to download better browsers and had to use Apple Music 
len ratingone I will lose lots of time and work because of the crashes and I just give up 
len ratingtwo Love chrome really 
len ratingtwo But the last update when you have multiple log ins for a site you now have to scroll through the list instead of typing the first letter and it taking you to those options Really not cool when you have logins 
len ratingone I like Chrome on MacBook but HATE it on iPad 
len ratingone For the love of God would you PLEASE fix the problem of embedded video from YouTube of all places not playing in Chrome on iPad 
len ratingone People have literally been complaining about this crap for years 
len ratingone None of your suggestions fixes the problem 
len ratingone Google owns Chrome and YouTube yet you can t fix this problem or won t 
len ratingone Whenever I go watch YouTube videos the YouTube app shows up every time whenever I go to a different video 
len ratingone To make things worse whenever I press no thanks the YouTube app still shows up before every video 
len ratingone Can you please stop doing this because it s starting to become annoying and I don t to use this YouTube app 
len ratingthree Hey buddy gym l or k you Mo pplease was a mn ionosphere is up Keep getting

len ratingone Now consistently crashes when trying the open links in emails from the gmail app 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingone  This is a key logger and tracker disguised as a search app Kiss your privacy goodbye if you have this nightmare installed on your device 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingone I m going back to DuckDuckGo and IXquick 
len ratingone I m not a product for sale 
len ratingfour I LOVE Google chrome but I wish I could have the themes and extensions that the laptops and Chromebooks get 
len ratingfour Otherwise Google is my searching and assisting developer 
len ratingfour Please make an update for iPhones and Androids 
len ratingfour Thank You 
len ratingone  Since this latest update Chrome is unusable due to constant crashing 
len ratingfive Good browse chrome
len ratingone As for the last updates now when you try to leave a tab and come back or make a new tab the app will sometimes get frozen on the grey background screen behind the pages and the only way to fix this is to hard reset the app only issue is now chrome deletes all of you incognito tabs when you do that so there is a sense of never knowing when all of your work is going to be lost by getting a way to frequent pop up or switching to the tab above please fix this devs your customers are dropping 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingtwo I can t read any stories on wattpad Because the page that I m reading the story in Will Not Scroll Down 
len ratingtwo I have to my Finger on the Page To Scroll Down 
len ratingtwo And if I Let go Of it It s just gonna Freeze 
len ratingtwo I don t know why my Phone which is an IPhone has these Issues while my mom Phone IPhone Plus And My father IPhone Don t have these Issues 
len ratingfive  You should have extensions in chrome As well as finding a way to have a better pop up blocker and managing pop up ads as well as sites redirecting you
len ratingone The latest version june is the worst ever 
len ratingone It crashes whenever I jump out of a chrome browser window to go to another app for info even if just for a minute or so 
len ratingone When I try to go back into the chrome browser window back from the other app chrome crashes and shows the white screen with logo 
len ratingone Then it freezes for about seconds and then shows the chrome did not shut down correctly do you want to restore 
len ratingone If that happened every so often I would not complain but not every time I want to go to another app and then go back 
len ratingone Terrible update 
len ratingone I am using an ipad running latest ios 
len ratingone Please fix immediately 
len ratingone I will have to use another browser app until you do 
len ratingone Very dissatisfied 
len ratingone Never had a problem before with chrome before this update 
len ratingone When I try to open an amazon link it sends me to the amazon app then to safari 
len ratingone What is wrong with this stupid app 
len ratingone When I hold down on the link there is no open option or open in option there s only open in new tab open in incognito tab or copy link URL 
len ratingone I CHOSE to open the google chrome app 
len ratingone If I wanted to search on another app I would have opened another app 
len ratingone PLEASE LET THERE BE A SETTING TO TURN THIS OFF 
len ratingfive I think google chrome is a great browser 
len ratingfive First it s secure and if I am about to enter an unsafe website it quickly shows a warning screen that I am about to do something unsafe so I can quickly get out of the page 
len ratingfive Second it is fast and simple and I can quickly get to wherever I want without wasting any time 
len ratingfive In conclusion Google Chrome is a great browser 
len ratingfive Would really recommend this app 
len ratingfour The major issue is that The YouTube build with us studio is out of sync with it 
len ratingfour What s that all about 
len ratingone I don t like how it has the option to close all taps but not an option to retrieve them 
len ratingone Nothing good on the app can replace such a critical feature 
len ratingone Fix it so I don t have to have a love hate emotion over it 
len ratingfive Confundidos
len ratingfive Beautiful
len ratingone I used to LOVE Chrome 
len ratingone But the iPhone version started getting those obnoxious popups out of nowhere You ve won an Amazon gift card 
len ratingone or You ve won a new iPhone Wal Mart card whatever 
len ratingone I ve NEVER ONCE clicked on any of that 
len ratingone I simply deleted the app and downloaded it again later 
len ratingone Well the past few weeks it s gotten SO ridiculous that this morning it happened literally LESS THAN TEN SECONDS of loading it 
len ratingone Why Google allows these crooks to monopolise what used to be a REALLY great browser is beyond me 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome 
len ratingone No more downloads enough is enough I have reached the end of my tether 
len ratingone We re done forever 
len ratingone It s obvious this is not ever going to work 
len ratingtwo For some time now months at least my bookmarks bar on my chrome app does not reflect my desktop chrome bookmarks 
len ratingtwo It s like it got stuck last year and hasn t updated since 
len ratingtwo Very bizarre 
len ratingthree Unlike the iPhone when you turn your phone to landscape mode you no longer have the option to tap the top of the screen to return to the top of the page or have a view of the clock
len ratingfive thanks 
len ratingthree I ll be reading a sample app or a review and just abt to buy into it the the article will turn off or the word GET WILL POP UP 
len ratingthree WHEN I DONT KNOW THE CONCLUSION OF THE ARTICLE OR How MUCH IM PAYING TO GET IT 
len ratingthree Sorry
len ratingone The latest update freezes on the splash screen 
len ratingone Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but still doesn t work 
len ratingone Now unusable 
len ratingone  Title says it all 
len ratingthree I think its time to bring the Chrome Extensions to iOS devices 
len ratingthree Otherwise its good Update yrs after NO EXTENSIONS SUPPORT ON IOS
len ratingone  This has been going on for months if I have LTE or G the app won t connect and says There is no internet connection with the error message ERR INTERNET DISCONNECTED even though I clearly have connection 
len ratingone Thankfully Safari and Firefox don t have this issue but it s a shame I can t use Chrome 
len ratingtwo I know incognito tabs close when you close app but for most people it s better to have tabs opened 
len ratingtwo It also tidies the app up a bit when you re swapping from tab to tab 
len ratingtwo It protects user save data I ve never had an issue before 
len ratingtwo I don t like the change at all 
len ratingtwo Security is good to have but some things never hurt 
len ratingone I ve always had chrome as my main browser on my iPhone however I constantly used the open in feature to save pdf s on my phone 
len ratingone For whatever reason I can t click on the open in link as every time I press on it the link disappears 
len ratingone I tried rotating my screen to be accessible and it seems the link needs to me moved slightly just so my phone does not think I m trying to swipe up to view my iPhone home screen 
len ratingfive YAASSSS this was a great time 
len ratingfive Faster than outdated software and made easier than no other internet software program
len ratingone I ve had it with google pushing their liberal agenda on people so goodbye google hello bing 
len ratingone No thanks
len ratingfive Literally it is like boom it is there
len ratingone Literally the only thing I used this app for was sending videos to my chromecast 
len ratingone Lost the ability to do that after last update 
len ratingone Of zero use to me now 
len ratingone Deleting 
len ratingone I d use this browser all the time if I could log into my google account from my iPad Air 
len ratingone This is a known error so not sure why it hasn t been fixed 
len ratingone Cmon google 
len ratingone Even after another update same freaking error 
len ratingone Pitiful 
len ratingone Not sure what happened but for some reason the app simply won t load 
len ratingone I tried re installing it twice to no effect 
len ratingone  Google is dog 
len ratingone I wondered why I had problems 
len ratingone I m not young but until a few days ago I noticed some issues 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingtwo Once a week at least some website ends up hijacking my content and locking up Chrome with some offer tonight of a free gift card 
len ratingtwo Right 
len ratingtwo The offer locks up the browser so I can t close the window 
len ratingtwo I end up having to delete 
len ratingtwo This time I am not planning to reinstall 
len ratingtwo Get better Google or get out of the App Store 
len ratingone  i always use the autofill feature that s why this is the first thing i noticed after thr latest update 
len ratingone sad face
len ratingfour But it takes longer than Bing to open on my iPad 
len ratingthree Great app works just fine does its job no problems 
len ratingthree Con can t move tabs think this is a pretty big deal for a browser 
len ratingthree Auto if added
len ratingfour From the top browser competing for the mobile browser you expect best 
len ratingfour With last update the crash lost me some data 
len ratingfour I d prefer less features over stability from now on 
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingone All good but can t understand why does not support reading mode feature similar to Safari or Mozilla 
len ratingone Can no longer save GIFs or images 
len ratingone This is incredibly annoying seeing as that was the only reason I used this app to begin with the easy saving 
len ratingone  What is this annoying new feature on gifs where they show up as clickable videos 
len ratingone And when I tap and hold to save them to my library they don t 
len ratingone It s really pissing me off and if there s a different browser app that doesn t do this I m gonna start using them 
len ratingone This update causes crashes within about seconds of opening the app 
len ratingone Do not use this update 
len ratingone  Issue on iOS public beta not sure if it applies to other versions 
len ratingone  Every version gets buggier and crashes more 
len ratingone Edit The newest version locks up instead of crashing so progress 
len ratingone Not really 
len ratingone The Grey Tab of Death hasn t been fixed after several months 
len ratingone And because the app locks up instead of crashing Google doesn t get automated crash reports about it 
len ratingone I bet you dimes to donuts someone filed the issue and it was closed No Repro 
len ratingone I used Google Chrome for three days and deleted it 
len ratingone Too many pop up adds and then you can t get back to where you started 
len ratingfour  Hello 
len ratingfour since last updates i don t remember exactly when you broke incognito tab when accessing through d touch 
len ratingfour how to test 
len ratingfour d touch on app icon and tap New incognito tab 
len ratingfour the browser opens and it lays under status bar if you open any url it will show black screen 
len ratingfour if you press on All tabs icon and get back to this tab it will show display content 
len ratingfour so page is loaded but not shown 
len ratingfour ios iphone plus current version of Chrome 
len ratingfour tried to reinstall app just the same behavior 
len ratingone For some reason lost all of my bookmarks after this upgrade
len ratingthree  As someone who likes to switch beteeen android and iOS having searches bookmarks moved over is convenient 
len ratingthree However I can t even use Chrome as my primary browser on here 
len ratingthree Performance Chrome not only takes longer to open than Safari but overall is not as smooth 
len ratingthree Design Aesthetically Chrome looks pretty decent 
len ratingthree However it s not as user friendly as the Android version or Safari 
len ratingthree The back button is all the way in the upper left hand corner which requires stretching your thumb super far while on Safari you just reach over to the bottom to go back where your hand naturally rests 
len ratingthree It makes you realise just how important the back button really is and ruins the experience 
len ratingthree If you re not looking to sync one browser with multiple devices don t even bother with Chrome on iOS as it s nowhere as good as safari 
len ratingthree However it is nice for those who use Chrome across multiple devices it just isn t as fast or as nice to use as safari 
len ratingone  That s not smarter than a th Grader 
len ratingone Fix it or no coveted five stars 
len ratingone I hate this app 
len ratingone It keeps deleting my open tabs after a while saying google chrome hasn t shut down correctly 
len ratingone Most times it gives you an option to reopen tabs but this time it didn t 
len ratingone This has happened way too many times 
len ratingone I work so hard to open the tabs that I have open and then it just gets rid of them 
len ratingone Why don t you make an update that prevents chrome from crashing all the time and closing peoples tabs 
len ratingone I don t think I have ever had this problem with Safari 
len ratingone I keep getting a hacking message on Chrome about a free phone it is jot my provider 
len ratingone I delete Chrome wait a few days and reload 
len ratingone It comes back in to days 
len ratingone can t get rid of it 
len ratingone would love to send a pic of the message but to where 
len ratingone  Mysteriously disappearing tabs seems to be the new problem no one tested for 
len ratingthree App no longer opens 
len ratingthree Crashes instantly Update 
len ratingthree Working again
len ratingthree Chrome can t block scam pop up and I had to delete app and re download it 
len ratingthree No way I would click ok on scam pop ups 
len ratingtwo Give us IOS users a home button please 
len ratingtwo Don t know why is so infuriating to not have one but it s blasphemy 
len ratingthree  I m not sure if it s a bug or expected behavior but when you close the app any amount of incognito tabs are not only closed but when you re open the app the amount of tabs shows up in the normal window as blank tabs 
len ratingthree For example if you have two incognito tabs open and close the app down then reopen it you will have two blank tabs in the normal window 
len ratingthree Our use chrome religiously and Prefer it over any other web browser app so please fix this or explain if it s expected behavior 
len ratingone Received sex offender alert with link to offender info in my neighborhood 
len ratingone When I attempted to follow the link to identify the sex offender a google chrome app download appears 
len ratingone So who is the sex offender in my neighbor hood 
len ratingone is chrome using the sex offender alert system to get new chrome signups 
len ratingone One star for the same reason as the top complaint 
len ratingone Can t copy paste anything and they re conveniently acting like it never happened 
len ratingone Bull
len ratingtwo Have to agree with others 
len ratingtwo Chrome freezes multiple times a day 
len ratingtwo When will this get fixed 
len ratingtwo I use it on all my hardware but on my iPad Air it freezes constantly 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately as a researcher that s a fairly common occurrence 
len ratingtwo I can load the PDF in the browser but when I click open in chrome exports a corrupted file regardless of what app I try to send it to 
len ratingtwo I m not sure if this is an Apple problem or a Chrome problem but problem it certainly is 
len ratingfive It s so awesome
len ratingthree I use chrome regularly both on phone and on computers laptops and iPad 
len ratingthree I like being able to seamlessly browse across devices see history and keep open the things u want to go back to 
len ratingthree However I ve recently been having massive problems with pop ups across websites in browser on the iPhone 
len ratingthree It s incredibly frustrating and I ve tried the fixes making sure pop up blocker in enabled clearing history cache uninstalling and reinstalling yet the problem persists 
len ratingthree It s very very frustrating and makes me consider moving back to Safari or another browser 
len ratingtwo  I use Chrome on all of machines pc iPhone and iPad 
len ratingtwo But the mobile version of Chrome is severely lacking 
len ratingtwo The most important feature imho available on the desktop version not on the the mobile app is the ability to bookmark all open tabs 
len ratingtwo VERY disappointing and a pain to bookmark each individual tab when you have more than tabs to bookmark 
len ratingtwo Also the bookmark manager is worse than the desktop version 
len ratingtwo Less functional 
len ratingtwo If you maintain a nested folder structure for your bookmarks this is not the browser for you 
len ratingtwo All branches of folders are exposed when saving a bookmark as opposed to collapsed branches of folders for ease of searching 
len ratingtwo So it takes exponentially more time to search for a proper folder to store a bookmark the larger and deeper your folder structure is 
len ratingtwo Additionally if you manually set your bookmark folder structure e g 
len ratingtwo Not in alphabetical order the mobile version automatically sorts the bookmark folders in alphabetical order 
len ratingtwo Very annoying 
len ratingtwo I also continue to be disappointed that Google doesn t support a simple search and replace feature on either mobile or desktop devices 
len ratingtwo The one capability that the mobile Chrome app has over the desktop version is the ability to handle more than open tabs at one time 
len ratingtwo This may be as a result of differing OS iOS v Windows 
len ratingtwo Even with the negative items I point out Chrome is still far superior to any other browser available 
len ratingtwo I just wish the Google Chrome team would provide better functionality with the mobile app and understand their user base better 
len ratingone  Location all of a sudden is not picking up 
len ratingone When I google restaurants near me Louisiana it acts like I m in Texas 
len ratingone Every time I try to sign in I get an error message try again later 
len ratingone But it never works 
len ratingone What good is it if it doesn t work 
len ratingtwo The browser is fine but the only reason I downloaded it was to be able to cast videos from websites similar to how you re able to cast from a computer and in this app you cannot do that 
len ratingtwo When is this feature going to be added 
len ratingtwo Will download this app again when I can finally cast from it 
len ratingthree Starting a couple of weeks ago I was unable to use Chrome for more than a few page views maybe minutes it crashed and had to be killed reopened 
len ratingthree It usually restored my tabs but it was not great Bob 
len ratingthree I was considering a switch back to Safari 
len ratingthree I like having my bookmarks synced but not enough to deal with this ridiculous behavior 
len ratingthree If it was any other app I would ve scrapped it a long time ago and never looked back 
len ratingthree But then I decided to try a delete and reinstall if nothing else but to check the box to send a note to the developers when it crashed 
len ratingthree And whatdya know it s better 
len ratingthree So changed to stars 
len ratingfour Google is a best kind of app to either look up things or to ask about anything even History 
len ratingone  I d use this browser all the time if I could log into my google account from my iPad Air 
len ratingone This is a known error so not sure why it hasn t been fixed 
len ratingone Cmon google 
len ratingfive Thanks for staying with us and keep our home clean and neat you are always welcome back again 
len ratingone Another reason for me that I ve switched from android to iPhone is the fact that android is crappy and taking away a feature that people use is sad we use the save image for the exact reason whether we want to save an image of a document on a site an image from a google search 
len ratingone Don t make me go into the reasons why we save images whether it s for a wallpaper or for porn that doesn t mean take away a save feature 
len ratingone I thought you guys where smarter than that but looks like I was wrong 
len ratingone Android and its apps are never gonna get better that s why I ve switched to iPhone and used its safari and its apps ever since 
len ratingtwo Is there anyone else who cannot move the cursor along their google search bar 
len ratingthree I would switch over from safari in a heartbeat only if they could move everything to the bottom so I don t have to stretch my finger all the way to the top of my screen 
len ratingthree Very irritating 
len ratingthree Besides that everything is top notch
len ratingfive I really appreciate your service especially the shuttle service was awesome I really recommend this place to those who need to drive to the airport 
len ratingtwo I just started using Chrome recently last month or so and all was going well until this last update 
len ratingtwo Now it shuts down my whole tablet or freezes making it impossible to do anything unless you do a force shutdown 
len ratingtwo Please fix this or go back to the old version 
len ratingtwo Sometimes I like to use the Incognito tab and it s pretty amazing 
len ratingtwo Although this app is great and all there are some problems 
len ratingtwo One of the problem that I am facing is that Every time I leave the INCOGNITO tab s open and leave the app it closes it by itself 
len ratingtwo The tabs are deleted and I am back to the main tab 
len ratingtwo This wasn t a problem before but after I updated it started to happen and it is very annoying 
len ratingtwo I like Google Chrome and I use it almost on every device 
len ratingtwo I hope this problem is fixed 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive I want to be able to change from Dark or light theme in the app please 
len ratingfive That would be great thanks 
len ratingthree I m a huge Google fan lately I observed that the incognito tabs are being closed every time I clear the background apps including chrome browser on my iPhone 
len ratingthree This is happening after the new release 
len ratingthree Can someone please fix it 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone Switching back to safari now 
len ratingone I was shutting down the app about times a day on my iPhone 
len ratingone Constant crashes and freezes
len ratingtwo He notado como en la ltima actualizaci n se congela la aplicaci n y se cierra constantemente 
len ratingtwo Me he visto obligado a migrar a otros navegadores que brindan mayor estabilidad y confiabilidad 
len ratingone How to STOP this from coming to my phone 
len ratingtwo Real inconvenient as have to scroll to top to use gesture 
len ratingthree I used to have pages of incognito tabs and now those are gone 
len ratingthree It used to open to incognito by default now that is gone as well
len ratingtwo Chrome has been amazing up until a few months ago 
len ratingtwo Now every time I open a new tab it freezes and shows the gray background behind the tab changer until I restart the app 
len ratingtwo This app is unusable and it s getting on my nerves because they haven t fixed it and it s been months 
len ratingone Between Googles algorithms and facebooks the app is constantly crashing or reloading 
len ratingone As I don t trust either of these horribly untrustworthy information gathering incredibly intrusive corporations I don t use FB apps period I only use this horrible GOOGLE app to go to Facebook
len ratingone This update is so bad I can t use the browser anymore 
len ratingone Freezes every time I try to co to a different page or as a page 
len ratingone Won t unfreeze until I stop running the app and wait a few minute before reopening 
len ratingthree I use Chrome across devices but I have a frustration with this version 
len ratingthree When I have a PDF open in a tab the Open In button at the bottom does nothing 
len ratingthree I want to be able to save these PDFs but Chrome won t let me 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingthree It s annoying to have to open a website in Safari just to get the PDF 
len ratingtwo That option to copy pdf to ibooks is not working well please fix it
len ratingone Woke up this morning and all of my open tabs were just gone 
len ratingone No option to reopen them just gone forever 
len ratingone Guess I won t be trusting chrome ever again 
len ratingfive I m going to thezcfg
len ratingtwo This chrome is very good but I ve been waiting for long to have an option to save pages because I m not always connected to the internet after some hours I come back to chrome and I see that I need to reload the page I only this problem could be solved 
len ratingone Use it twice it freezes whatever has been done to improve this isn t doing it
len ratingone Their prices are out of control 
len ratingone If there s anyway to find another service do it 
len ratingone They will wipe you out 
len ratingone Had to delete the Chrome app to get past a pop up add that demanded an ok Google should not allow modal pop ups to disable browser functions like close window 
len ratingtwo What happen to the cast feature 
len ratingfour Updated now some of my apps will not work in this browser 
len ratingfour Android 
len ratingfive The cabin crew work there but off the service was excellent the pilots were terrific as well 
len ratingtwo About every days I get a scam saying you have won a Samsung galaxy blah blah blah of it needs to be fixed 
len ratingtwo The only way to move off the scam screen is to delete the app and download it again 
len ratingone  Can no longer use the search engine your prefer forced into googles home page 
len ratingone Evil stalker Google Eric at what he does best 
len ratingthree I sometimes add a webpage to Reading List and when I m offline and want to read that webpage it can t show me the page in offline mode and needs to be online 
len ratingthree I need to read pages offline 
len ratingone I had a TON of open tabs 
len ratingone The app crashed like it normally does seriously it crashes a LOT 
len ratingone When it came back I tapped restore and exactly ZERO of the tabs came back 
len ratingone Checked history for recently closed tabs and none of them were there either 
len ratingone WHERE DID THEY GO 
len ratingone  So apparently Google but in some stupid new feature in Chrome for iOS where it will open a random tab to some random site by Google Ads integration which I don t recall approving but that s a whole other story 
len ratingone I cleared all browser cache closed all tabs 
len ratingone Force closed Chrome and started it back up and it immediately pops up a tab to either the raw story com or the Palmer report com both of which I could give two sh ts about way to go google analytics 
len ratingone Thanks but no thanks 
len ratingone I ll be deleting Chrome and moving over to Edge now 
len ratingone At least they haven t forced crap on me and only silently collect all my personal information 
len ratingfive  stars this app is amazing the feedback is good and barely takes up any space but it does have its flaws like no WiFi but you have unlimited data but it still doesn t load but it s a pretty good app google
len ratingone Absolutely baffled as to why Chrome always filled its homepage news with items about the Kardashians 
len ratingone I never search for them or follow them in any way yet Google seemed to make it a point to push them and Celebrity in general into my newsfeed 
len ratingone No more 
len ratingone Deleted the app switched to Firefox 
len ratingone It s so much better in so many ways 
len ratingone And Chrome wants me to crawl through six months worth of history to find them 
len ratingone I have used this Chrome app for years 
len ratingone Just recently it has started to crash after browsing for a while 
len ratingone When it crashes a black background appears but it is non functional 
len ratingone I have to then force close the app and wait for a bit before reopening 
len ratingone My iPhone X was uploaded from the iPhone S 
len ratingone Shortly afterwards I experienced freeze up and touchscreen issues 
len ratingone The iPhone X was cleaned and reloaded at the Apple store but experienced the same issues there 
len ratingone I was issued a new iPhone that was loaded from the cloud and sent home 
len ratingone Within a week I had similar issues with the new phone 
len ratingone The Apple store restore the phone to factory and loaded only apple native apps 
len ratingone I was told to download third party apps one at the time 
len ratingone About a year later I re downloaded Chrome and within a week I had problems again 
len ratingone I deleted the app and restarted my phone and have not had that problem again 
len ratingtwo Hutton said tJB GN hHeM
len ratingone  When I try to open an amazon link it sends me to the amazon app then to safari 
len ratingone What is wrong with this stupid app 
len ratingone When I hold down on the link there is no open option or open in option there s only open in new tab open in incognito tab or copy link URL 
len ratingone I CHOSE to open the google chrome app 
len ratingone If I wanted to search on another app I would have opened another app 
len ratingone PLEASE LET THERE BE A SETTING TO TURN THIS OFF 
len ratingfive Your a MEME incognito mode is a MEME XD
len ratingone  EDIT The app is getting stuck when trying to open a new tab or go back to an old tab just freezes on a blank screen and you must do a hard reset to get it back where it may or may do it again upon launch 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone Lol
len ratingone I m not sure if it s because of the update or I simply never noticed 
len ratingone But incognito mode tabs will randomly disappear 
len ratingone I was using the mode for some financial things and put my iPad down for awhile when I came back all of my tabs in incognito mode were gone 
len ratingone Really hoping this gets fixed 
len ratingone I used to love this browser 
len ratingone  It takes a minute or two between loading pages then crashes all the time 
len ratingone The FBI spyware is slowing down my internet experience so bad 
len ratingone Keep being Evil google 
len ratingone Useless because I can t download chrome extensions
len ratingtwo All incognito tabs close on app restart 
len ratingtwo I don t know if this is a bug or an intentional update but either way it annoying 
len ratingone I hate how all of my incognito tabs are closed once I close the app 
len ratingone I use incognito mode regularly and this is very inconvenient 
len ratingone I d not give this app a better rating unless they brought that feature back 
len ratingone I WANT MY INCOGNITO TABS TO BE THERE ONCE I OPEN THE APP UNLESS I DELETE THEM MYSELF 
len ratingtwo I might be the only one or one the few to complain about this but the I miss the way that I could close chrome and leave incognito tabs open and they are still there I feel like instead of removing the feature it could ve been something made optional to have it so that a user can choose to make all incognito tabs close once they close chrome or have them stay 
len ratingtwo Chrome leaves the user no recourse when one if those scam redirect pop ups Congrats 
len ratingtwo You Won an iPhone hijacks the browser 
len ratingtwo Quitting Chrome and reopening doesn t fix this problem because Chrome insists on reopening that last page 
len ratingtwo Okay 
len ratingtwo Let s clear browsing data and history 
len ratingtwo Go to Chrome settings 
len ratingtwo Nope there is nothing there 
len ratingtwo I just uninstalled and reinstalled 
len ratingtwo I heard there is an airport mode solution too 
len ratingtwo I am middle aged and could see people older than me not knowing what to do and just repeatedly clicking on those scams 
len ratingtwo Okay 
len ratingtwo So what 
len ratingtwo All browsers suffer from these 
len ratingtwo Not true because Safari allows one to remove cookies and data via the settings menu 
len ratingtwo These pop ups appearing on very reputable websites have been around for several years now and it baffles me that a browser developer would allow their browser to be hijacked like this 
len ratingtwo There has to be a better way 
len ratingfour I used to be able to use the share icon in Chrome on my iPad to send items via email save in Dropbox or use LastPass 
len ratingfour Now when I press the share icon nothing happens 
len ratingfour I want it back please 
len ratingone Surprise surprise 
len ratingone Does NOT allow users to use their search by image function 
len ratingone Instructions are incorrect 
len ratingone Really guys 
len ratingone Get over it and incorporate functionality 
len ratingone Deleting this app because of this and MANY other compatibility issues 
len ratingone Issues like this keep push Google Android products away 
len ratingone Too bad Apple doesn t have email or I d switch to that and kill my google email too 
len ratingtwo Recently there s been frustrating amounts of pop ups
len ratingone Keeps crashing in incognito and I lose all my windows
len ratingone Don t download this buggy piece of software 
len ratingone If you re using an iPad it s impossible to save images from the direct image link 
len ratingone Often you can save the image thumbnail but NOT the direct image link which provides full resolution 
len ratingone Stick with Safari and call it a day 
len ratingtwo I can barely stay on a website for minutes before it crashes 
len ratingone I understand Google is trying to make some money but when webpages have advertisements and the rest is allocated for the title and the actual content maybe it is time to rethink the product
len ratingone I ve noticed that all my incognito tabs get deleted when I take chrome off my background as in when I swipe up on the open app in order to not waste battery 
len ratingone I ve tried logging in to chrome with an email and seeing if that would save my incognito pages as they are 
len ratingone Nope 
len ratingone I can t stand using the regular non incognito side of chrome because my eyes are extremely sensitive to color and light and the darkened banner is just more comfortable for me 
len ratingone I ve been using Firefox but I just can t get used to it 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive Excellent help
len ratingone All of a sudden whenever I look at a gif on google it decides it s a good idea to load and play the gif before I even click on it 
len ratingone Before it has a small gif icon in the bottom corner but a few days ago this went away and gifs began to play without my consent 
len ratingone Not only is this aggravating to me as I would like to decide whether or not I want to see an animated image or not but it also brings the app to a slow crawl and makes my phone hot to the touch within minutes 
len ratingone I find this unacceptable and unless there s a way to turn it off I can t give the app more than a Star 
len ratingone I turned off location tracking and Google Chrome is tracking me anyway 
len ratingone I resent this and feel it is a total abuse of power and trust 
len ratingone Fix is within days or I m uninstalling 
len ratingone  I did allow a charge
len ratingfive I like crome a lot but for some reason I say ok google and it doesn t open 
len ratingfive Not sure why 
len ratingfive But would bet it s this stupid iPhone 
len ratingfive iPhones apps and user content are made by All the rejects engineers from Google Facebook and any other service like this they make everything as hard as possible so that you can t get to what you want just by asking for looking 
len ratingfive iPhone Engineers and code writers are worthless 
len ratingfive I should ve got myself a Google phone 
len ratingfour  I am not able to make the payment
len ratingone When trying to visit the AmericanPregnancy website which comes up on Google search the app locks and a pop up appears asking me to claim a Walmart gift card 
len ratingone Only way to fix is to delete the app and re download 
len ratingone Doesn t happen in Safari 
len ratingone  Since past days the app doesn t launch it stays at the loading screen for some time and then closes for some reason
len ratingone I left safari thinking chrome would be a better product however when I open an image I can t click and save it which is extremely frustrating 
len ratingone I use my iPhone for business and I use images a lot images from my company s website to answer client concerns quickly 
len ratingone So I guess I am going back to safari until you make this a priority 
len ratingone Super bummed 
len ratingone  When i search for something the app won t let me click next to see the next page of results 
len ratingone I can see the option when i scroll down but the screen automatically scrolls up not letting me press it 
len ratingone Are shitting me 
len ratingone I can t look at more than one page of results 
len ratingone Fix this trash 
len ratingone I just updated chrome and now everytime I go to open a new tab it freezes up 
len ratingone I usually rely on chrome when using my phone but right now I can t
len ratingfive This is like so cool and it s like a dream come true 
len ratingfive  Okay not really a dream come true but it s really awesome 
len ratingfive P S 
len ratingfive Like above WOW 
len ratingtwo Not easily accessible hard to reach to switch tabs
len ratingone When ever I use the search options it s asking so many random questions totally unrelated to the tropics 
len ratingone And finally time wasted 
len ratingone Poor services 
len ratingone  Avoid this app 
len ratingone It s great in the sense that you can open up a bunch of different tabs but every time I have tabs up the app crashes on me and when you go to click restore the restore button just disappears and I lose everything I had open 
len ratingone This happens to me on a consistent basis and it really puts a negative spin on a app that has potential but I can never have anything important up because I know I ll eventually lose it 
len ratingone This happens to me so consistently that I ve stopped using chrome all together 
len ratingone It s so frustrating to lose everything you needed open that frequently 
len ratingone Find another browser 
len ratingone Pretty gay tbh
len ratingthree  I m a recent Chrome convert on my Mac and I want to use it more on my phone but it s a bit frustrating 
len ratingthree The share extension doesn t seem to work when you add links to read later as they don t appear in Chrome s reading list 
len ratingthree I d also like an open in Chrome option 
len ratingthree I ve had to reroute through Workflow to open links in Chrome 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingtwo Don t know what s going on 
len ratingtwo Can t load internet pages 
len ratingtwo They were working a few hours ago and now they won t load
len ratingfour  I love chrome I use it for everything 
len ratingfour Recently it s being so slow 
len ratingfour When I try to load a page it s either blank with a blue bar that is filled at all or a blank page with a bar filled all the way 
len ratingfour Please fix this it s really annoying 
len ratingthree Pretty functional and very clean interface 
len ratingthree I only wish that I could move around the open tabs like I can on the mobile version of safari 
len ratingthree As it is right now the mobile version of chrome keeps your tabs stuck in the same order unless you close them and then open them in the right order which is a kind of ridiculous workaround 
len ratingthree I hope they fix this soon 
len ratingone This update makes it so any incognito windows that were open are gone once you leave the app 
len ratingone I don t know about others but I find this to be an annoyance rather than a feature
len ratingone I love Chrome but the last couple of releases are extremely broken and not worthy of release 
len ratingone Before I can get to a new tab I have to wait about seconds before the browser will respond 
len ratingone Totally unacceptable 
len ratingone Maybe I ll switch to firefox or safari 
len ratingtwo So I watch videos on chrome and the picture is appreaing up it s black screen can guys fix this plz ASAP
len ratingone I have very bright eyes so I use incognito mode because the normal search feature strains my eyes very quickly 
len ratingone Can google stop fixing things that don t need fixing 
len ratingone Also I ve noticed a decent increase in the times chrome crashed over the last couple of days 
len ratingone At least make chrome have an option to make the normal search bar dark almost like Reddit 
len ratingone Anytime I open a new tab the app crashes
len ratingone Stuff I search for in chrome starts showing up in my wife s Facebook with complete strangers commenting on things I viewed even though I don t use Facebook 
len ratingone I m not signed into chrome but it only happens with stuff I search in chrome 
len ratingone This has never happened when I use safari 
len ratingone I ve been using google chrome for a long time and lately it has been restarting and deleting my tabs and it gets annoying because it s happening all the time 
len ratingone It s happening two times a weeks and I can t get my tabs back 
len ratingone After the most recent update Chrome will not even open 
len ratingone Entered a site that had a popup 
len ratingone Browser can not be used unless I go into settings turn off cellular and WiFi and then close the app and reopen it 
len ratingone This is an obnoxious workaround 
len ratingone The app keeps crashing new pages and reverting to previous ones 
len ratingone Laughably few options for user customization even less than the awful desktop version somehow and of course it immediately starts throwing ads or as it calls them suggested content in my face until I turned that off one of the whole options this browser offers 
len ratingone Why anyone thinks this is a good browser is beyond me 
len ratingone When I would use this app to search I would get articles or information that supported Leftist views 
len ratingone Even the news feeds on bottom of the search screen were entirely articles against conservatives 
len ratingone All searches were very limited 
len ratingfive Kreekcraft
len ratingthree The last few weeks the app has been constantly freezing when opening a new tab and it just crashed leaving me with no tabs and no way to recover the tabs 
len ratingone i look something up and then there is a ad for it even more scary is they use your microphone for ads talk about dog toys for minutes you will see ads for dog toys
len ratingone It has become unusable due to the freezes 
len ratingone I have quit using and deleted it because it freezes everytime I try to browse with it 
len ratingone It was the best now it s a bust 
len ratingtwo Used to be able to turn off JavaScript to help reduce ads and load times 
len ratingtwo Looks like they removed the feature since google makes too much money from those ads 
len ratingtwo No point in downloading another browser since I get a worse experience with something else that always wants updates
len ratingone Another lie 
len ratingone You cant clear your history using the privacy feature 
len ratingone As a website owner constantly improving upon my site i have a real need to clear the cache to see how my changes render 
len ratingone Nope not chrome mobile 
len ratingone Cache does not clear no matter how many times you try 
len ratingone It will only do it eventually on its own to hours later 
len ratingone So the button itself is a Google lie 
len ratingone So i would assume that in an attempt to clear or guard other privacy concerns using this feature is also a lie 
len ratingone The big Googly machine cant be trusted folks start using other browsers 
len ratingfour Incognito tabs are closed by its own after closing the app 
len ratingone Latest update freezes regularly and the Open In feature for PDFs seems to work only when it wants to 
len ratingone Pressing it actually does something only very rarely 
len ratingone Most of the time it just does nothing at all 
len ratingone On the iPad Chrome crashes constantly has no ability to print at all and loses most of its history so if you navigate away from a site it s gone most of the time 
len ratingone Apparently Google spent its development dollars making a fancy non intuitive interface rather than making a browser that actually works 
len ratingone Woo hoo it connects to all sorts of wacky Google services too bad it stinks as a web browser 
len ratingone Chrome on the iPad is for people who care more about whether their car has enough cup holders rather than if the car actually starts 
len ratingthree It s supposed to have this added feature 
len ratingthree Not really like most things they google are long on hype and short on follow thru 
len ratingfive  Google Chrome is an amazing fast and easy to use browser 
len ratingfive I highly recommend it for iPhone users it makes online browsing very easy and smooth 
len ratingone When there was no local data saved there were no crashes 
len ratingone No I ll crash after opening up more than tab in incognito mode or if I m signed into an account when using it regularly it ll crash with a few tabs open 
len ratingone And I constantly have to reset the settings to prevent active tracking and saving search queries 
len ratingone Everything feels slower and finicky now switching between tabs gets messed up halfway so I have to close then open the app again there s a lack of more privacy options and the constant crashing is garbage 
len ratingone Not to mention url opens from the beginning now and navigating it is a hassle 
len ratingfive  I don t get why the bad reviews I LOVED IT
len ratingfour Exceptionally good
len ratingone GOOGLE CHROME IS SUCH A BAD DONT USE THIS USELESS APP IT WILL WASTE ALL YO TIME DONT AT ALL PEOPLE
len ratingone Incognito tap closest when closing the app
len ratingone Chrome is my browser of choice across multiple devices and Operating systems 
len ratingone Since the most recent update it won t open 
len ratingone It s very frustrating 
len ratingone This version is incredibly buggy and freezes up on pages that contain a lot of content 
len ratingtwo  Chrome is usually my browser of choice 
len ratingtwo It s what I use on my laptop and desktop no matter if it s windows or Mac 
len ratingtwo However lately the iOS version has been very buggy 
len ratingtwo For example webpages open blank and I have to refresh them to see anything 
len ratingtwo The share button doesn t work at all if I m reading a webpage and want to send it via email or iMessage that menu doesn t open 
len ratingtwo I wouldn t get the app 
len ratingfive Chrome is amazing 
len ratingfive I love the voice control and how it s way better than safari 
len ratingfive This is a amazing app and I would recommend this to a lot of people 
len ratingone You can t even open it anymore 
len ratingone It creates when you try to go to any site and deleting and reinstalling hasn t helped 
len ratingthree UPDATE The update released April th and th has not fixed this problem 
len ratingthree After the most recent update whenever I exit Chrome with any incognito tabs opened they disappear whenever I reopen Chrome 
len ratingthree This does make things difficult for me since I use incognito tabs to act as another window so I don t have overwhelming amount of tabs open for a regular browsing 
len ratingfive  Jenny Craig is the Best Ever weight management program I ve ever experienced 
len ratingfive It is very structured program and the Counselor Consultant are very supportive and knowledgeable of the program 
len ratingfive I started in and I kept my weight loss since then 
len ratingfive I ve learned a great deal about weight management thru Jenny Craig 
len ratingfive I even referred of my coworkers and they both thank me of my recommendation 
len ratingfive They are both diabetic n the good thing is JC counseled both in a way both have a personalize program 
len ratingfive Till now I still buy few of the food just for maintenance purposes 
len ratingfive I love JC food 
len ratingfive Easy n convenient to take to work 
len ratingfive I have admired all the things Google can do 
len ratingfive I was a worshiper 
len ratingfive But when APP On the App Store your password should not be asked as Rule 
len ratingfive To me Google is a Gem 
len ratingfive But nowadays I feel frustrating when I am fumbling to satisfy someone s ego 
len ratingfive Still Google is very much better now and now that their Chrome is on iOS and iPad 
len ratingfive What more can I ask 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive My best friend YAZ
len ratingthree I have never had any problems 
len ratingthree Except for once I was making a pic collage and the pics i was trying to save didn t save 
len ratingthree I would really like to have my bookmarks alphabetically organized instead of chronological 
len ratingfive It s pretty coo 
len ratingfive Love the candle scents 
len ratingfive Candle burn evenly and I enjoy mixing up the scents according to the seasons 
len ratingfive I am hooked 
len ratingfive Everyone who visits my home comments on the lively fragrances between the lit candles and plug ins I have throughout my home 
len ratingfive Shopping experience is also pleasurable 
len ratingfive I can save images still no lag no crash 
len ratingone After update chrome won t run
len ratingone Edited to add I couldn t remember why I stopped using this app so I resumed using it 
len ratingone It only took a day to be reminded and it s not even anything I wrote about below in my original review it allows scam pop ups that can t be closed you re a winner 
len ratingone or Your iPhone has been selected 
len ratingone and that even prevent the tab being closed 
len ratingone I use no less than six browsers because they all do something great and something awful and Chrome is the ONLY one that allows these scams to pop up 
len ratingone This time I m just deleting the thing 
len ratingone And taking away a star 
len ratingone  Freezes ALL the time 
len ratingone On my desktop I prefer Chrome because Firefox has become as slow as IE but on my phone I m tending to use FF more and more because Chrome constantly freezes 
len ratingtwo This app used to be great but since iOS it s been plagued by freezes lag and near constant crashes it s really upsetting because this used to be so good I hope it gets fixed soon
len ratingfive  You should have extensions in chrome
len ratingone This browser used to be great but there are some aspects that have just been ignored by the devs through the changes 
len ratingone As already apparent you cannot save images anymore from image only tabs at the highest resolution for who knows what reason 
len ratingone This browser also doesn t support downloading internet profiles x security profiles which is VERY irritating because it instead saves them to your google drive 
len ratingone So I have security profiles just sitting in my drive which means I have to delete them which means this app gave me more work 
len ratingone The browser also doesn t keep your position on the page when switching from portrait to landscape mode which is one of the worst features ever 
len ratingone Lastly the browser moves the screen up when you select a text box to type in and this is BY FAR THE MOST ANNOYING FEATURE 
len ratingone My phone lags often because it s a couple years old not everyone buys the latest greatest 
len ratingone So if I click a text box say for example the Google search engine and it doesn t show that I have selected it I will sometimes click again just to be redirected to a google auto fill search 
len ratingone This happens too often 
len ratingfive  UPDATE The update released today April th has not fixed this problem 
len ratingfive After the most recent update whenever I exit Chrome with any incognito tabs opened they disappear whenever I reopen Chrome 
len ratingfive This does make things difficult for me since I use incognito tabs to act as another window so I don t have overwhelming amount of tabs open for a regular browsing 
len ratingfive Best
len ratingthree  I m a huge Google fan lately I observed that the incognito tabs are being closed every time I clear the background apps including chrome browser on my iPhone 
len ratingthree This is happening after the new release 
len ratingthree Can someone please fix it 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone Can t use with WiFi
len ratingfive  After the most recent update whenever I exit Chrome with any incognito tabs opened they disappear whenever I reopen Chrome 
len ratingfive This does make things difficult for me since I use incognito tabs to act as another window so I don t have overwhelming amount of tabs open for a regular browsing 
len ratingone In iPad Pro doesn t work when select account after install booom crashed
len ratingone After update chrome frequently freeze while reading 
len ratingone It has performed perfectly till recently 
len ratingone Tied deleted and re download and same problem occur 
len ratingone I saved a bookmark and edited the location 
len ratingone Then it just crashed 
len ratingone I love this app but lately something has been wrong with it 
len ratingone Every time I go between some of the tabs it will sometimes go to a grey screen but still be in the app 
len ratingone Then I have to exit the app double tap on the home button completely turn off the app and then restart Chrome in order to use it again 
len ratingone Every 
len ratingone Single 
len ratingone Time 
len ratingone And it will sometimes close all of the tabs I had open without giving me the option to restore them 
len ratingone Please fix this I really want to keep using this app 
len ratingone I m only allowed to use chrome when it s over Wi Fi 
len ratingone Won t let me use my cellular data in app 
len ratingone I m sick and tired of it and I m fed up and I m moving to firebox until it s fixed 
len ratingthree iOS version of Safari has reader view I strongly suggest we should leverage the same 
len ratingfive I live this app when I need to search something up I always go on here it s awesome app to use you should get it
len ratingone Cannot click back on page
len ratingfive Great customer service 
len ratingfive Friendly helpful staff 
len ratingfive Great inventory 
len ratingfive Made shopping easy
len ratingone When I m on a site the whole Crome app will go black and no windows are able to be used 
len ratingone I have to shut it down n reopen multiple times 
len ratingone It s beyond annoying 
len ratingfive You being unable to save or copy an image doesn t warrant a one star get over yourself 
len ratingtwo On Iphone I get scam pop ups from sites and cannot close them 
len ratingtwo If they are unsecure sites I d imagine that the app would alert me 
len ratingtwo It doesn t 
len ratingtwo I have to Uninstall app to close virus pop ups 
len ratingtwo This is annoying because safari has bad compatibility with sites I use for school so Google Chrome is all I can use 
len ratingtwo I m switching back to Android 
len ratingtwo Google Chrome needs better compatibility with iPhone 
len ratingtwo After latest update the app will freeze if you open a new tav and the screen will go dark grey like it does when youre opening an incognito tab and it just stops functioning 
len ratingtwo Only issue 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating 
len ratingtwo  stars cant even use the f 
len ratingtwo app for longer than like a couple a minutes
len ratingfive Runs perfectly and exceeded my expectations 
len ratingfive Something I really like about this app in particular is that you can access your browsing history and bookmarks from your computer on your phone 
len ratingfive No complaints 
len ratingthree Overall this is a good browser for IOS that I ve used for a long time 
len ratingthree Recently though there emerged a new issue Not with the last update but the one before that where every time I close the Chrome app it automatically closes every tab I had open 
len ratingthree This happens in both regular and incognito tabs and when I reopen the app it starts on the default regular tab 
len ratingthree There is no message about chrome crashing and I cant find any other information about it anywhere as well as others with this problem online 
len ratingone Since the last two updates the browser freezes and crashes within seconds of using 
len ratingone Doesn t seem to matter which site always crashes 
len ratingone Tried reinstalling but didn t help 
len ratingfour It is a great browser but it is sometimes slow Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfour With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingtwo  No saved passwords or other auto fill data populates 
len ratingfive i
len ratingtwo Could you guys please fix the fraud scam pop ups 
len ratingtwo It renders the browser unusable 
len ratingtwo I m hoping a reinstall will help but not confident 
len ratingtwo Too many malicious pop ups even with pop ups disabled 
len ratingtwo I have have to uninstall the app just to get rid of the pop ups 
len ratingone Since the new update all of my bookmarks are now completely out of order 
len ratingone I have to manually sit and try to put them back in alphabetical order 
len ratingone Please update the app to where all of my bookmarks are set to automatically be placed in alphabetical order 
len ratingfour I have an iPhone SE an iPad mini both running the current version of iOS 
len ratingfour I use multiple computers Mac Windows Linux appreciate that information syncs between all the devices 
len ratingfour The only issues I have are that Chrome does not accept extensions particularly ad blockers I can live ads as long as I do not have to click or swipe on them they are not sensory intrusive no flashing movement or auto play that it does not seem possible to cast videos from Chrome casting works from other apps on my devices so I do not believe this is a device limit or a configuration issue 
len ratingthree The Android Chrome version seems a bit more up to date 
len ratingthree This IOS version takes me back to sitting at my desk top 
len ratingthree In the world of APPS icons it s nice to be able to load any of your favorite websites to your SCREEN instead of a bookmark list 
len ratingthree The bookmark list is nice for something you might look up once in awhile 
len ratingthree When there s a site you go to everyday it s ice to just click on the icon you re there 
len ratingthree Android Chrome has the option to add to homescreen it s on the option list of bookmarks 
len ratingthree Come on Google 
len ratingthree Update the ole Apple version once in awhile 
len ratingthree Why does Android get all the neat stuff 
len ratingthree I want my favorite websites on my home screen or any screen not on a list 
len ratingthree Some of the websites even make cute little icons for those that like to save to homescreen 
len ratingthree Geeze 
len ratingthree I notice a lot of other peeps hate your dinosaur bookmarking 
len ratingthree Please just try adding to home screen you might make many people happier 
len ratingthree They can just click on an icon instead of trying to maneuver through the list 
len ratingthree It s sort of ironic Apple was the company that created the icon system and yet you shy away from this 
len ratingone  The UI is constantly locking up so that I can t scroll 
len ratingone I have no idea why but it seems to have something to do with JavaScript 
len ratingone This has been happening consistently for over a year and I m sick of it 
len ratingthree  After update chrome frequently freeze while reading 
len ratingthree It has performed perfectly till recently 
len ratingthree Tied deleted and re download and same problem occur 
len ratingone Everything by Boogle is horrible 
len ratingone Normally works ok but recently Chrome keeps crashing 
len ratingone I m just browsing reading and all of a sudden I get the black screen and I have to force close the app because nothing is responsive 
len ratingone The menu new tabs switch tabs nothing works 
len ratingfive As you can probably see already everyone that gets an app usually checks other s opinions before they use it that s what people like me and others are for 
len ratingfive My opinion is that this app is a in a half mostly because there own strategies of doing things without our opinion so we must stand up for ourselves and tell our true opinions 
len ratingone Can t save files from email in other apps 
len ratingone Open in comes up at bottom left of screen but doesn t respond when pressed to select where to open 
len ratingone Chrome has been crashing on me for weeks now 
len ratingone I have submitted feedback several times 
len ratingone I see from other reviews that I m not the only one keep getting the oh snap something went wrong doesn t matter what site I m on or if I m on my home WiFi or someplace else 
len ratingone I can t switch to safari because I keep getting those annoying pop ups about winning an amazon gift card 
len ratingone I have an iPhone and I have tried all the suggestions on how to fix but the issue keeps happening at this point I don t know what else to do 
len ratingthree I love how Chrome app integrates perfectly with my desktop Chrome 
len ratingthree I ve enjoyed using it greatly and prefer it to Safari 
len ratingthree HOWEVER I opened up an audiobook from an email in the Chrome app and it STILL plays every single time I open the app 
len ratingthree I ve closed the app all tabs deleted it reset my phone etc and the Audio STILL plays every time I open the app 
len ratingthree I can t open the app unless I want to turn my volume off and it becomes a real hassle now 
len ratingthree Please fix this or tell me how I can solve this problem or I m going to have to resort to Safari 
len ratingone The Google Chrome browser can be used for porn way too easily 
len ratingone This is a devilish app 
len ratingone I will never use Google Chrome 
len ratingone Google needs to have an app that will not allow any porn 
len ratingone This is disgusting 
len ratingone I will never use Google Chrome 
len ratingone Loved google till I read the entire Damore memo for myself and saw the screen shots of not hiring white or asian men 
len ratingone People aren t random over of USA is white google is only white and they are desperately trying to lower that 
len ratingone The only way to appear to not be racist is to actually be systemically racist 
len ratingone Equality of opportunity is democracy 
len ratingone Equality of outcome is communism 
len ratingone  boycott google cathynewnaninterview
len ratingone I have not been able to get chrome to work 
len ratingone App opens nothing happening can not browse 
len ratingone Installed new Apple update and still not working please fix 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingone Bookmarks from Firefox chrome PC or Safari won t export to Chrome iPad 
len ratingone Deleted this app on all iOS devices 
len ratingfour  Hi Google 
len ratingfour Why can t I use chrome net internals 
len ratingfour Why can t I download and save file 
len ratingfour Zip file for example or even PDF 
len ratingfive  it s the best
len ratingone  When I create a incognito page and swipe up on chrome all of the incognito pages erase I m giving this one star until it doesn t happen anymore
len ratingtwo Bad latest update 
len ratingtwo Browser continually freezes and has to be restarted 
len ratingfive Love is in my option to this app and I am speachliss
len ratingone I am no longer able to long press on a downloaded image to save 
len ratingone The feature works on Safari and Firefox 
len ratingone I am running iOS 
len ratingone Absolute worst app 
len ratingone When it actually decides it feels like opening it just locks up 
len ratingone I just reinstalled it figuring I d give it another try time to uninstall again 
len ratingtwo  There s no longer a second skip ahead option for playing video which makes it hard to scribe very small amounts 
len ratingtwo If it is your doing that the video format has changed I d like to request to change it back 
len ratingtwo the website I m using to view these videos is fhfshow com I don t know if they changed the format or if it was the app please let me know so I can contact them about it
len ratingfive this is a really good browser app even replaced safari for me 
len ratingfive but it s suddenly been crashing on me a lot for the past few days 
len ratingfive this is very irritating and warrants a fix 
len ratingthree When I shut my phone off completely cause I have school It deletes all the tabs I have 
len ratingthree In both incognito normal 
len ratingthree It s so annoying 
len ratingthree Especially when I need to get school work done 
len ratingone I ve used chrome for as long as I can recall but now it s been buggy and closing all my tabs regardless of if it s incognito or not 
len ratingone Initially it started out as a problem by automatically closing my incognito tabs but now it s just closing everything 
len ratingone I ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling but still nothing 
len ratingone Is there any fix for this 
len ratingone Update Closing incognito tabs for security is understandable but it s been closing all my opened tabs 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingfour Need there update now get try closing a tab go to black pages
len ratingthree  Seems okay but it doesnt show any suggested articles for me 
len ratingone Every now and then I want to add a new tab and click the view all tabs button at the top right the entire app freezes or crashes and I have to restart my phone just to get it started again and have the option to restore my tabs 
len ratingthree As stated in the title after updating it seems as though my sessions while browsing incognito do not get saved like they used to 
len ratingthree Prior to this I could close the app or leave it in the background and it would go back to incognito and IF I ever did lose my session it would ask me to restore to no avail due to it being incognito which is expected and I was ok with that 
len ratingthree Whenever I open the app now it won t even ask to restore session so I am assuming that this is intentional 
len ratingthree If so I am not a fan of this change but I am writing this to make you all aware of this change bug 
len ratingthree The app itself is good and I wish I could set it as my default browser to open links and what not 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone Argggg won t load page 
len ratingone Keeps timing out 
len ratingone Last two weeks 
len ratingfour Safari is so bad 
len ratingfour You think Apple will try to have security to protect you 
len ratingfour But no 
len ratingfour It s only chrome that tries to protects 
len ratingfour Safari only notifies Apple that you got a virus and then Apple fixes it
len ratingone I enjoy the Google ecosystem and I understand its more limited because of iOS but I m not able to save images from webpages with a long press I have to copy the URL and paste it on Safari and then I can long press the image and hit save image 
len ratingone Is this intentional 
len ratingfive Fix your app latest update plays videos after you ve hit pause to stop a video to do something else 
len ratingfive When you change apps it starts playing again 
len ratingfive Overall a very good app of browser

len ratingfive I ve been using Chrome since Chrome was available and since IE was eating up both time and resources 
len ratingfive Google is as comparable as variety is to the spice of life 
len ratingfive Chrome is not a sparse area to browse Chromes uncomplicated depth and density match whatever breadth and length you choose to browse it does not falter a timely result be it reading image music video Wiki or shopping Google Chrome is one direct to the point browser indeed 
len ratingfive Simplicity is written in two words Google it 
len ratingfour I love chrome I ve used it for years 
len ratingfour But there is one thing I think would be a perfect feature 
len ratingfour Let s say I click a link in YouTube Twitter etc and the in app browser opens 
len ratingfour I can then click on the box with an up arrow thing and be presented with an open in chrome button 
len ratingfour Yes I know there is the add bookmark button 
len ratingfour But one that would simply just open he link would be fantastic 
len ratingfour Also why it is every time that I open a webpage that has to do with maps google asks me for my location I d like for it to remember my choice like it does on the PC version 
len ratingfour And one last thing 
len ratingfour Perhaps a send to PC button 
len ratingfour Similar to what Microsoft has but works on windows Macintosh linux chrome is you get my point 
len ratingfour Anyway keep up the good work Google 
len ratingfour I hope that you see this and maybe add these features in 
len ratingthree I got hit with a malicious pop up 
len ratingthree Back on Android I d just force close it and restart it 
len ratingthree On iOS 
len ratingthree I had to delete the app and reinstall to get it back without tapping ok on a seriously shady website 
len ratingthree That s ridiculous 
len ratingfive  keti
len ratingone NEW The tabs in incognito mode are gone when you close the app 
len ratingone I am frankly quite upset do you know how hard it was to find those websites 
len ratingone Please fix this posthaste Hi there did you see save image option when long pressing on the image 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone  ipad chrome 
len ratingfive The app is stupendous really
len ratingone  I don t know what changed but now chrome eats my battery

len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone Just use safari LOL Head
len ratingone Thanks iso
len ratingthree Hi it keeps crashing out of the app every single time I wanna see the history since a while ago 
len ratingthree I just updated to the latest version but the problem still exists please do fix it it s really annoying 
len ratingfive I WANT YOU TO BE MINE AGAIN BABY AYE I KNOW MY LIFESTLE IS DRIVIN U CRAZE AYEEER
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingfive  Google no offence but you need to stop making this app to keep updating it self everytime i get on it like every few hours you have to keep trying to make a ridiculous update
len ratingone De lo peor
len ratingfour  It freezes the keep me from open there tab need to fix now or better code writing 
len ratingfour But get me wrong it good browser app work with need to fix bad lol
len ratingthree The most annoying thing I ve come across is the aw snap error it happens every couple of minutes constantly making me refresh the page and end up at the start of what I was doing very annoying even more so when you clear caches and do what is recommended only to continue to get errors and have a word explanation with little or no info that would help me at least calm down and try to fix the problem still a good app otherwise
len ratingone It is getting frustrating to use chrome on iPhone 
len ratingone It gets stuck while scrolling and freezes the whole phone 
len ratingtwo Chrome is quickly on my Mac iPhone and iPad is quickly losing my support 
len ratingtwo I prefer safari on all platforms now 
len ratingtwo Very disappointing as once upon a time I was a huge fan 
len ratingtwo Google get your act together and fix the performance and syncing issues 
len ratingtwo The tab behavior is atrocious and not intuitive 
len ratingone Before it offered to translate pages I would hit yes and it was done 
len ratingone Now although I have not changed anything on my side it only says server error 
len ratingone This was my main reason for having this app 
len ratingthree Make an update where there is an option so that the incognito tabs won t close when closeing the app 
len ratingthree please Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingtwo  Chrome was my app of choice as a browser but I am now switching to Safari because it allows me to have the keyboard I want 
len ratingtwo I don t know why you put that extra line at the top with the extra microphone and a colon and a backslash and the QR bar and a com 
len ratingtwo Superfluous and unnecessary clutter 
len ratingtwo Please allow us to not have to look at it and I will come back 
len ratingone  uc 
len ratingtwo The new update will delete your tabs in incognito mode they claim it s for privacy 
len ratingtwo But we should have an option to turn that off some tabs I keep there to have at a moments notice 
len ratingtwo I usually have tabs open and finding an important one in that sea is impossible 
len ratingtwo That s why I would use incognito mode to keep them easily accessible rather than scroll through about tabs to find 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingtwo With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone Do not update 
len ratingone There are ads now that blast you on the front tab and it s annoying
len ratingfour  But honestly it s back and forth with everyone s opinion 
len ratingfour Just know if you want real advise why don t you ask the person that you re trying to hide this from 
len ratingfour All in the fam
len ratingfive  This will be the first and last review that changes any features through out all of google and any app associated with google 
len ratingfive I rebuke you devil in the name of Jesus go far away where god would take you you can not defeat my God 
len ratingfive He is more powerful than you and my god is my shield of armor 
len ratingfive Nothing can break through this shield for I am on fire for Jesus and you are not worthy of my time 
len ratingfive Everytime you strike at me I will shame you to everyone let who you are be known to thousands Every strike against me will return to you thousand times 
len ratingfive And I will be shielded even stronger 
len ratingfive My google and every app in google will give back to the people whom you have made suffer and may thee who follow Jesus in his righteousness have a beautiful life eternity no one will be thirsty and no one will be hungry let the eternal everlasting life be now 
len ratingfive Save energy 
len ratingfive Solar shall be the new energy 
len ratingfive Let Apple Facebook and Amazon also be included just as google is 
len ratingfive It s time to give back and let gods will be done 
len ratingfive Amen everyone who is righteous be protected forever 
len ratingfive The main reason why I use chrome is how fast it loads 
len ratingfive I also admire how simple the UI is and the fact that you can swipe down to close open tabs 
len ratingfive It s the best app for my Apple IPhone 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I use it more than safari
len ratingfive Loads faster better favorites mgmt 
len ratingfive just better period 
len ratingfive Faster than most 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive Chrome is the best search engine in my opinion 
len ratingfive You should buy it 
len ratingfive Best of all it s FREE 
len ratingone If you can t rely on a browser to not close tabs what s the point 
len ratingone Very irritating 
len ratingthree I m just writing this review to make the rate this app pop ups go away 
len ratingthree Thank you so flipping much Google 
len ratingfive  av
len ratingfive  Awesome app I m still enjoying
len ratingfive Excellent browser fast and free of ads
len ratingthree I just wish it saved the private browsing tabs like it used to whenever you exited 
len ratingthree Now any time you close the app all tabs are deleted 
len ratingthree It would be nice to maybe have a setting to keep those tabs open 
len ratingthree  Thanks for your feedback

len ratingone Crashes
len ratingfive This is so fast and easy to use 
len ratingfive It will change your life
len ratingfive  OK OK OK
len ratingfive Like better than any other searcher
len ratingfive Buenicima
len ratingfive Great app there is quite a few programs that only run on Chrome 
len ratingfive Not Explorer 
len ratingone Half of the web page keeps getting cut off I wish I could attach a picture but this has been happening for nearly a year now and I have to force quit chrome and re open in order to fix this 
len ratingfive  good
len ratingtwo Chrome will not allow you to download a pdf to either acrobat app or to ipad ibook app 
len ratingtwo This makes it totally useless if you wish to save info from most sites on ipad 
len ratingtwo So then you have to copy the url log out of chrome and google and open the safari app or firefox paste in the url 
len ratingtwo Then you can save the pdf 
len ratingtwo This is basically totally stupid and probably used to keep your privIte info or some other nefarious reason 
len ratingtwo On ipad use a different browser 
len ratingthree Beat
len ratingone I had this app and it got deleted don t know how but then it continually said open and when I pressed that nothing would happen and my phone would glitch out 
len ratingone It would say open app as if I had it but I didn t 
len ratingone Still can t get it
len ratingone Dumbos
len ratingfour Sometimes I have to refresh because links and stuff won t work 
len ratingfive Chrome is where you do things fast
len ratingthree This app disappeared on me one day and hasn t come back yet was very convinent says I have it in App Store but if I press open it won t 
len ratingthree Please help 
len ratingthree  or is there something wrong with my iPad Hi there are you able to install Chrome from App Store 
len ratingfour  Great but sometimes google crashes
len ratingfive The best multi platforms apps from searching to writing
len ratingfour The recent March update has a few issues with it 
len ratingfour The main issue I face is when I try to hit the tab button and look at all of my open tabs 
len ratingfour When I exit a tab to do that all of my tabs disappear and I can only see the black grey background along with the New Tab Tab Count and Options buttons 
len ratingfour When I hit them they don t do anything and I have to restart the app to have my tabs come back 
len ratingfour I can t tell if it s because I have a gazillion tabs open which I wasn t facing this issue a few days ago before I updated and had a bunch of tabs open or if it s just a bug with the new update 
len ratingfour Otherwise it works great 
len ratingfour I just hope this gets fixed D
len ratingone Google will show you what it wants you to see 
len ratingone They will try to control you and you research 
len ratingone They know where you go and they see you went you ve been good or bad 
len ratingone Just as Santa google is there 
len ratingone To know everything about you and sell it 
len ratingfive YOUR MOMYOUR MOMYOUR MOMYOUR MOMYOUR MOM 
len ratingone I run a business and I need to be able to print things from chrome 
len ratingone It won t let me print in landscape 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone The removal of guns and gun accessories from Google Shopping is ridiculous 
len ratingone Google is forcing their leftist agenda of Gun Control on the people 
len ratingone I have used Google s products since and today marks the end of that era 
len ratingthree The update that deletes all the incognito tabs when you swipe the app away teah that s just awful please bring it back 
len ratingthree I ve lost so much porn and barely figured it out today 
len ratingthree You guys are cheeks 
len ratingthree  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone It keeps freezing this update 
len ratingone  very slow 
len ratingone Not a great update 
len ratingthree  how come i can t find the chrome beta version on my iphone store
len ratingtwo All the photos I try to save come out all pixeled 
len ratingthree After this new update my chrome browser on my iPhone it freezes for a while and then the browser crashes 
len ratingthree Can t do anything on it cause same thing keeps happening 
len ratingthree Please fix this issue 
len ratingtwo It d be great if it would actually SHOW UP on my phone 
len ratingone  I love this app but lately something has been wrong with it 
len ratingone Every time I go between some of the tabs it will sometimes go to a grey screen but still be in the app 
len ratingone Then I have to exit the app double tap on the home button completely turn off the app and then restart Chrome in order to use it again 
len ratingone Every 
len ratingone Single 
len ratingone Time 
len ratingone Please fix this I really want to keep using this app 
len ratingthree I ve Been having some trouble exporting or sharing the webpage via the symbol that is Square with a arrow facing up 
len ratingthree Normally this would bring up a menu of what you would like to do such as export or send two or save as 
len ratingthree Unfortunately I press it numerous times and nothing comes up so I cannot get to the child menu underneath us icon 
len ratingthree Hopefully the issue isn t my again plus 
len ratingthree I am fully updated on the os and chrome ap 
len ratingthree Any advice 
len ratingtwo Honestly I like this app 
len ratingtwo I have access to my school google account and I can look anything up whenever I need to but the age limit is what s bothering me 
len ratingtwo I really don t see the point in this 
len ratingtwo Google may have their reasons and I respect that but I personally think that it should be 
len ratingtwo To me it just makes more sense 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive  iOS BUG iPad iPhone iPad 
len ratingtwo  Works ok but too multi stepped to use especially compared to Safari 
len ratingtwo An old old design now needs streamlining 
len ratingone  I like to read in incognito since I like the black banner at the top of the site compared to the white banner 
len ratingone Anyways I ve noticed that all my incognito tabs get deleted when I take chrome off my background as in when I swipe up on the open app in order to not waste battery 
len ratingone I ve tried logging in to chrome with an email and seeing if that would save my incognito pages as they are 
len ratingone Nope 
len ratingone Tried to use safari but I hate it 
len ratingone Can someone plz tell me how to fix if I m in the wrong 
len ratingone If I m not can this be fixed 
len ratingone Not user friendly at all 
len ratingone Actually not that bad 
len ratingone Chrome forces you into Google mobile sites Gmail Calendar etc on a screen the same size as many laptops 
len ratingone This wouldn t be quite so bad if Chrome on iOS could handle multiple Gmail accounts correctly 
len ratingone It doesn t 
len ratingone For example go into Gmail mobile site even if you select Request Desktop Site 
len ratingone It will use your default account 
len ratingone Go to the bottom of the page and tap the ID to select a different account 
len ratingone Once you re in a different account tap the three lines that show you labels 
len ratingone Scroll down to the very tiny text that lets you select Desktop 
len ratingone It goes to desktop mode but switches back to your default account even if you sign out of your default account 
len ratingone Not very secure on top of giving incorrect results 
len ratingone You re better off using other browsers or a Mac 
len ratingone  Google s mobile apps are not a viable option on a iPad because of they are too trivial minimal view of information and limited function compared to the full site 
len ratingone The most recent update introduces a host of stability and performance issues 
len ratingone Browser now crashes frequently is laggy with user inputs and loses state upon reatarting 
len ratingone Incognito mode tabs are not saved upon restarting the app 
len ratingone There are many browsers on the app store that now outperform Chrome 
len ratingone Didn d use to be that way but apparently Google is set on ruining their flagship browser by enhancing the user experience 
len ratingone Incognito tabs delete when the app is closed off but the cognito tabs remain they don t delete 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback

len ratingone  google 
len ratingfour I love the browser I use it almost every day 
len ratingfour However it seems with one of the new updates it either turned off or deleted the option to continue where I left off 
len ratingfour Every time I want to do some stuff I have to search again and again instead of just tapping on the tabs I already had open and I don t see any options in any of the settings 
len ratingone Recent update s have made this app really slow 
len ratingone My icon disappeared and when I go to the App Store the open function on the app does not work 
len ratingone Help 
len ratingone Miss being able to use Chrome 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive It feels like your on a computer laptop 
len ratingfive Many good features 
len ratingfive I like it and use it over safari because it looks nicer and operates better 
len ratingfive It s a great app so get it 
len ratingone I LOVED the chrome app 
len ratingone I would leave tabs open all the time for my convenance with no issues 
len ratingone Now if I even swap to another app for minutes whatever I was looking at is gone and I don t like that 
len ratingone I lost over articles that I saved for school and now I have to spend hours finding them again 
len ratingone Bookmarks still won t save right and it s frustrating 
len ratingone I used to do school work on this app while I wasn t home and now that s physically impossible 
len ratingone Looks like I just won t use chrome until better updates are released that make it more user friendly 
len ratingone  Hi we re sorry to hear this 
len ratingone Did you see any error message 
len ratingone Did you swipe to close Chrome when you swap to another app 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingone For a couple years now it seems Google has locked me out giving me WRONG verification codes 
len ratingone I lost a couple phones and had to do recovery 
len ratingone Because of this I m now homeless because my work depended on the Net text phone and PASSWORDS which I forgot because of Age I all but beg them to please help but there s nothing they ever do but send wrong recovery codes 
len ratingone I m talking to a Lawyer today and filing a suit for this 
len ratingone I used to be able to keep all my incognito tabs open even when I exited the chrome app 
len ratingone Now all the incognito tabs automatically close when I exit the app causing me to lose many websites I had open

len ratingfour  iPad 
len ratingone I ve used this app for years along with Safari and Dolphin 
len ratingone Each browser has its own merits so I d switch between them 
len ratingone I liked Google particularly because of the bookmarks and the easy incognito browsing 
len ratingone I could have hundreds of incognito tabs in Google close the app and open it to find those hundreds exactly where I left them 
len ratingone For a hoarder like me it was perfect 
len ratingone I could click open as many links as I d want to and only save the favorites to my bookmarks 
len ratingone A few days ago I opened chrome only for the screen to glitch for a second and ALL of my tabs to just disappear 
len ratingone Hundreds of pages 
len ratingone Gone 
len ratingone I was upset and frustrated but I figured it was a one time occurrence 
len ratingone It was the first time Chrome had failed me like this 
len ratingone Unfortunately now Chrome deletes all of my incognito tabs every single time I close the app 
len ratingone I have no reason to keep using it considering how invasive and creepily involved Google can be when it comes to browsing non incognito 
len ratingone It s a shame since I loved the bookmarks and the overall design but this update is retrogressive and inconvenient 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingfour Add the option for a darker theme
len ratingone  I constantly get malicious spam pop ups on Chrome 
len ratingone I have tried the advice on the web like clearing my cache and history but nothing works 
len ratingone Because Crome re opens the last site I had opened there is no way to get rid of the pop up other than deleting the app which is a pain 
len ratingone From other reviews many people are having this problem but google has done nothing to fix it 
len ratingone I am done with Chrome 
len ratingthree This app is for ages 
len ratingthree Really 
len ratingthree I use this all the time in schoo wow 
len ratingone Buggy since the latest update 
len ratingone Just hangs consistently 
len ratingone Used to be my go to browser 
len ratingone I m not sure when this happened but as of the latest update I believe whenever I quit the app in Multitasking all my Incognito tabs are closed 
len ratingone Otherwise a superb app but this is a huge issue for me as I use incognito tabs to organize my tabs all the time 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingtwo  google 
len ratingone  Didn t think popups would be a problem in freakin 
len ratingone Plenty of options other than Google and Chrome really is not all that special 
len ratingone If you re shopping then keep on looking 
len ratingone This isn t the browser for you 
len ratingone  And what the hell is up with all these old reviews 
len ratingone How are six month old reviews helpful to anyone 
len ratingone It has worked perfectly until about a week ago 
len ratingone Now it crashes freezes after about seconds all the time 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled and reinstalled with no help 
len ratingone Safari works fine so it s not my phone or internet 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone I updated Chrome a few days ago and the benefit of doing so has been daily crashes 
len ratingone I have lost many incognito tabs those I only needed for a short time and I cannot find many of them to restore 
len ratingone This is the worst update and may be the one to have me delete this app 
len ratingone Update Things have only gotten worse chrome crashes at least once a day since the update 
len ratingone It does t matter if there is one tab open or ten this app has got to go 
len ratingone I ll be a loyal Safari user from now on 
len ratingone Good bye chrome 
len ratingthree Chrome would be my go to browser if they can move the buttons that open tabs or settings on the bottom 
len ratingthree Would make it easier to mange the phone and browser with one hand 
len ratingone The new version calendar is terrible 
len ratingone There area several hundred users that want the Classic Calendar back Please 
len ratingone My complaint is I have to double tap everything I want to do 
len ratingone If I click on the arrow for next month q box pops up Next Month at first I used to click on the box that popped up but that would only allow me to edit the date that was underneath then I realized to click the arrow again 
len ratingone Why can t I click on the arrow the the calendar changes to the next or previous month which ever I clicked on Please return the Classic Calendar 
len ratingtwo This new update makes it a hassle to use incognito mode 
len ratingtwo It s set up so that when you close the app completely all incognito tabs are deleted and a fresh new regular tab is open and waiting for you when you reopen Chrome 
len ratingtwo Before all my tabs were saved regardless of whether they were incognito or not but now I have to manually open a new incognito tab every time I want to browse 
len ratingtwo Not a huge deal but extremely inconvenient 
len ratingtwo If this doesn t get fixed I ll bite the bullet and just use Safari in privacy mode since it at least saves the tabs 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for your feedback

len ratingfive  It s a Bitchin Browser there are others but only one Google other Browsers to include quite an extensive list here in appst but integrating aspects of Google s innovation creativity and professionalism security and superior customer services and support has set aside others to just independent developers genius and corporate sponsors for purposes of capital generating by the minions 
len ratingfive As an epistemologist and UX VUI cognitive and behavioral scientist eclectic philosophically and student of experimentalism marketing social engineering predisposed to furthering humanities across all aspects of boundaries of economic and socio ethnocentric complexities Googles got it going on but then look at Opera Dolphin and especially iCabMobile WebKit and Gecko aside Omnigroup s browser needs a evolutionary change too 
len ratingfive You want Chrome but you need it too and you have the right to universality in your apps where secured index your cloud sync your purchases and financial data best practices that requires your own personal preference and desired outcomes 
len ratingone  The app is getting stuck when trying to open a new tab then when you force close it you lose all of your incognito windows

len ratingone  I downloaded it decided to sign in with my google account then the first thing I see on my home page below the search bar is a link to an article with the title containing a major spoiler to a show I m slightly behind on 
len ratingone I d rather not see any articles at all on my home page 
len ratingone I didn t ask for it

len ratingtwo  It keeps crashing on my iPhone wile I m watching shows it closes and it just kinda buggy
len ratingfive Good for porn
len ratingfive  I love this app cause when I use it at school I can also use it at home so I don t have to use my laptop I can use my iPhone
len ratingtwo Since the last update everything time I exit the app all of my tabs disappear 
len ratingtwo I just can t use it without getting angry every time I open the app just to see all my pages gone 
len ratingtwo It s just really frustrating 
len ratingone Admittedly I would have rated this app higher if it weren t for this issue 
len ratingone It seems that the new update has gotten rid of all my incognito tabs which is pretty frustrating since I use those pretty regularly and like to switch between the regular and incognito ones 
len ratingone I also checked the update description and it didn t say anything about this happening 
len ratingone So if this issue can be fixed it would be greatly appreciated 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone Don t install the latest update if running 
len ratingone It crashes on startup and you will be forced to use safari or update your OS 
len ratingone SAME PROBLEM WITH GOOGLE VOICE 
len ratingone I can t even check my text messages 
len ratingtwo Convenient google app but if I close the app then any incognito tabs I was using get deleted 
len ratingtwo I do not want this I hope that this is a bug and it will be fixed Thanks for your feedback

len ratingtwo Fix the tabs
len ratingfive hhshs
len ratingfive  PC PC 
len ratingtwo I really wanted to like this app since I use chrome on my MacBook and google drive is very important for my school work 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately chrome for iPhone is not very user friendly which is surprising coming from google 
len ratingtwo Bookmarks should be the first thing you should see when you open a new page not articles or ads you think we want to see 
len ratingtwo  We are humans our interests always change we look up random things we aren t interested in stop trying to show us what YOU think we should look at 
len ratingtwo It s also hard to sort through different pages you have open since they all basically pile on top of each other instead of being more spread it to see what was on that page 
len ratingtwo Guess I m switching back to safari 
len ratingthree Now of course it syncs your Google accounts and bookmarks 
len ratingthree It s still chrome which gives it three stars 
len ratingthree However it s chrome at an extremely dumbed down level 
len ratingthree The interface is the worst I ve see n in which you access everything from a single button and drop down menu 
len ratingthree It s uninspired like they didn t try at all to make a real interface 
len ratingthree Compare it to Safari and the clear winner is not this browser 
len ratingthree Easier for me to just use the Google app than this lame thing 
len ratingtwo Before you could leave your incognito tabs open and they would still be there when you started the app again 
len ratingtwo After the latest update they are all cleared out Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingtwo With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone I usually keep all my incognito tabs open all the time 
len ratingone After newest update they were all closed and I can t keep any open when I leave the app 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone Before the update Chrome would keep my incognito tabs saved even after exiting out of the iOS app 
len ratingone Now this update closes my incognito tabs when I close the app this is a dumb feature that no one requested 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone  bug 
len ratingtwo  After the new update the incognito tabs keep deleting themselves and the app runs much slower for me

len ratingtwo Hi I m the kind of person that keeps about windows open regular browsing and incognito and when I opened my browser yesterday all of my private windows were gone 
len ratingtwo I used incognito mode yesterday as well and I noticed that when you close the app it clears out the private windows 
len ratingtwo I m sad because I keep stores poems makeup inspirations on these tabs and I can never remember where I left them 
len ratingtwo Please go back I didn t want this update it just happened 
len ratingtwo  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingtwo With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone Certain websites have pops that you can t do anything but click ok and it takes you to a virus site
len ratingone It s been years and Chrome still does not have D touch support 
len ratingfive Never a problem
len ratingtwo I ve always enjoyed using Chrome as my default browser on iPhone until about two months ago i began experiencing spam ads that would pop up and take over the entire app functioning 
len ratingtwo Even when I would close the window and the app and reopen it the ad would pop up again 
len ratingtwo There was no option except to click on the ad which one time i did and it led me to further spam pages that asked me for my personal info 
len ratingtwo I have even deleted the app from my phone and then downloaded it again but inevitably the same thing would happen again 
len ratingtwo Because of this unfortunately I have had to stop using Chrome 
len ratingtwo This problem has not occurred with Safari so for now I m sticking with that 
len ratingtwo I m writing this in the hopes that it can be addressed so I can safely return to using Chrome again 
len ratingtwo Thank you 
len ratingone I like to have incognito mode tabs and regular chrome tabs open at the same time and I leave them that way whether I m on the app or not for the ease of convenience when I come back 
len ratingone I slid back and forth between the two easily and I haven t had a single problem before now with that system 
len ratingone After this update every time I leave chrome ALL of my incognito tabs are deleted completely 
len ratingone I have been all over the google website link in the description and here trying to find something that says that little tick is on purpose but so far I can t find it 
len ratingone I ve seen the notes that it disappears when you hit the x and stuff but nothing about unwanted quits 
len ratingone Is this how it works now and I need to change my browser search engine or is this some sort of glitch 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback

len ratingfour The app runs so smoothly and without complications 
len ratingfour It s fast easy to use and it has private browsing 
len ratingfour But there is one thing I don t like 
len ratingfour At times I ll have a lot of private tabs 
len ratingfour Most of which are very important to what I ll be doing at the given time 
len ratingfour I don t know if it s a bug or it it s actually part of the recent update but each time I close the app all of my private tabs just disappear 
len ratingfour I ve lost so many documents because of this 
len ratingone The app is pretty good 
len ratingone It is pretty stable and I ve only got one complaint 
len ratingone The ad bar 
len ratingone No matter what I do it keeps giving me ads of a certain type 
len ratingone Even when I click don t show this type of ad 
len ratingone It still comes back 
len ratingone I go to settings and put the type of ad as not wanted and yet it still comes back 
len ratingone It keeps coming back 
len ratingone For this one reason I have deleted this app and will use something else 
len ratingone  Good day I said Good Day 
len ratingfive After we were rear ended on I we contacted Gauthier Amedee Law Firm and were assigned Christopher Chris McNeil to represent us 
len ratingfive He proved to be an asset to us in our case settlement 
len ratingfive Chris is thorough knowledgeable and compassionate 
len ratingfive We highly recommend Christopher McNeil and Gauthier Amedee Law Firm 
len ratingfive Frank and Rena C 
len ratingone The March th update made it to where every time I want to see a different tab the app freezes and I have to exit and restart the app every time 
len ratingone One problem that keeps on happening with the new update is that the app keeps getting reset and deleting all my tabs when I close out
len ratingone After reading some other reviews it seems like many other users are having the same pop up issues 
len ratingone Going on normal websites result in random pop up that can t be closed 
len ratingone Even when restarting the app the pop up will just immediately appear and hijack your screen again 
len ratingone I have deleted the app after the last instance 
len ratingone I am on the newest OS with the newest version of the app 
len ratingone Not sure whose problem this is but I m going to use safari until it s resolved 
len ratingtwo Chrome app on my iPhone keeps getting hijacked 
len ratingtwo I have to delete and reload it every few days 
len ratingfive  OO 
len ratingone After recent updates I get redirects 
len ratingone i usually do everything in incognito but every time i close out of chrome it deletes all of my incognito tabs 
len ratingone i m not sure if this is intentional but i m still pretty disappointed Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingfive This update has made chrome really bad 
len ratingfive It s being really really slow and laggy when I m trying to switch tabs 
len ratingfive And 
len ratingfive It s causing my phone to heat up 
len ratingfive Please fix this ASAP 
len ratingfive I expect a response from the developers on this as well 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone This is the laggiest app I ve ever used on my iPhone 
len ratingone I will stick with Safari which doesn t crash or freeze every time I open it 
len ratingone I love it on my PC but it s garbage on iPhone 
len ratingfour Love Chrome for windows 
len ratingfour I ve saved a lot of PDFs over the years 
len ratingfour But behind credentials a login page I can t save a pdf from chrome on iPad to iBooks Google Drive or anything else 
len ratingfour I love chrome 
len ratingfour But I can t use it for what I need just yet 
len ratingfour I need Chrome to pass whole pdf instead of making the next app try unsuccessfully if behind a login page to download the pdf again 
len ratingfour This could be problematic for users who download unprotected PDFs if the files are large imagine downloading a MB pdf twice really Thanks for your hard work and I look forward to this added functionality 
len ratingone When I try to go to new google sites it says Google Sites only works with the two most recent versions of the following browsers Chrome and Firefox I have the update and I have restarted the app and reloading the page 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingtwo Frustrated that the navigation buttons are at the top 
len ratingtwo The experience with Safari and Edge ahem edge out this browser for that reason 
len ratingtwo I would rather use chrome for its ad protection but i find the controls out of reach 
len ratingtwo Thanks for your efforts devs appreciate the hard work 
len ratingone Your recent update in breaks functionality 
len ratingone When I tap on a form field e g 
len ratingone Username it shows me as expected above the keyboard saved values I can just tap to fill in the form 
len ratingone Let s say in a Username field I tap a j and then jones is suggested above the keyboard 
len ratingone When I tap that then jones successfully appears in the field 
len ratingone Upon submission however only j is submitted as the value for that field even though I ve filled the form out by tapping the suggested value of the keyboard 
len ratingone  response to developer pEST Have closed and ended the process many times 
len ratingone Still happening on your most recent update that was available at the time of this message 
len ratingone Functionality used to work fine and now doesn t 
len ratingone Able to repeat the problem following steps outlined in original message 
len ratingone Is there an easier way to communicate other than through this app review 
len ratingone Not crazy and not making things up 
len ratingone The issue is real 
len ratingone When the value fills in in the field after tapping the suggested value the actual value that is set is just the first letter EVEN THOUGH the entire suggested value appears there 
len ratingone Upon a form submission or evaluation of the field s value it registers only as the first character 
len ratingone If a user taps the field to edit the value and then hits backspace and then replaces the deleted character with what was there then it finally nudges the field s logic and or recognition of the full text of the value that was auto filled when the suggestion was originally tapped 
len ratingone  response to developer pEST I know this is definitely an issue with the version I cited above because before I updated my iPad I had updated my iPhone first which is where I noticed the problem I tested the older version of Chrome on my iPad and it worked correctly just as it has in the past 
len ratingone Then I updated Chrome on my iPad and tried the same thing again on the same website and it failed to work properly 
len ratingone  Now when you force close the app all incognito pages close and disappear 
len ratingone Bull 
len ratingone I usually leave like pages open 
len ratingone Also 
len ratingone Glitches out constantly so that you can t scroll to the bottom 
len ratingone Used to force close and reload 
len ratingone Now I can t 
len ratingone Change back plz Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingfive I love Chrome I think the rating is in error because I tried times to give it stars because I was trying to start with one and work my way up to 
len ratingfive Or maybe I am just less experienced than most people on the proper way to rate 
len ratingone The worst Google Chrome yet 
len ratingone Saw the developers response to another review addressing this SAME ISSUE image search malfunction 
len ratingone They basically responded durr can you open da image in a new tab Usually NO 
len ratingone Also what if it s 
len ratingone I ve already basically stopped using google over this crap 
len ratingone Any other browser and any other search engine no problems 
len ratingone Have you even tried to use your own app 
len ratingone This is pathetic 
len ratingfour Chrome has helped me in a lot of my work by keeping all my tabs incognito and keeping said tabs up when I close the app 
len ratingfour However this new update keeps getting rid of my tabs is there anyway to fix this 
len ratingfour  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfour With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingtwo When I first downloaded Chrome on my ipad it very rarely crashed 
len ratingtwo Now it seems that it crashes more with each update more often than not 
len ratingtwo I can tell when it s about to crash first it freezes then it comes back but as soon as you try to scroll it freezes again and as soon as you touch the screen BOOM it crashes 
len ratingtwo Very disappointed 
len ratingtwo Come on Google your way better than this 
len ratingone Could no longer use unlimited tabs 
len ratingone Tabs would be a blank background and wouldn t open or respond to commands 
len ratingone Fix this bug google
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingtwo This browser could be stars if it had a favorites toolbar setting 
len ratingtwo A home button would be cool too so you could set your default website 
len ratingtwo Add a default startup page setting user defined 
len ratingthree Pretty decent web browser 
len ratingthree I enjoyed Google Chrome on my desktop so I had to try it on my phone 
len ratingthree Pretty solid over all the only suggestion I would make is if you happen to close every window to browse on have the browser automatically open you one instead of having to create a new one every time if you currently have zero open 
len ratingone  This has to be the most poorly coded piece of trash program i have ever used 
len ratingone For example when you click a link on one page it ALWAYS opens in a new tab and that tab ALWAYS gets stuck 
len ratingone You have to copy and paste the link into a new tab that has desktop mode enabled or just use a browser that isnt coded by morons who somehow got a job at google 
len ratingone More than half the time this web browser cant load anything and you need to soft reset it 
len ratingone Tl dr hope you like seeing about blank when you click a link on this trashcan broswer
len ratingfive I like how it loads so fast 
len ratingfive I love the name google and I also like the logo and the WiFi internet 
len ratingfive Hope you have a great day creators bye 
len ratingone Can you please make the iPhone version able to cast like the android version does
len ratingone It crashed and gave me the option to restore all my tabs but failed to restore them 
len ratingone I had a lot of tabs open too 
len ratingone Malicious pop up visiting normal sites on iOS I own a chrome book this never happens but on my iPhone constantly 
len ratingone I keep getting pop ups telling me I ve won something as soon as I open the app 
len ratingone Can t do anything other than exit out 
len ratingone No other option but to delete the app 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingthree this app NEEDS an actual recently closed section like the desktop browser 
len ratingthree my app crashes all the time and deletes all my tabs and half the time it doesn t give me a restore button 
len ratingthree i use chrome so often that browsing through weeks worth of my history to find what i need isn t an option 
len ratingthree PLEASE add a function where you can reopen everything that was just closed 
len ratingone Since last update I can not open websites 
len ratingone It does not let me refresh 
len ratingone Very frustrated
len ratingfour Normally I love the chrome app it s basically the only app I use on my phone and for the most part it works great love that I m able to login to chrome on my laptop and phone and share the tabs I have open but ever since the last update it s been unusable 
len ratingfour Every time I open chrome I m greeted by a white screen with the loading bar at the top which then never loads 
len ratingfour If I swipe down to reload the loading bar just fills all the way but the page remains blank 
len ratingfour I ve tried looking on the support page but it just takes me to a page that describes how to download chrome which I obviously don t need 
len ratingfour I ve check for software updates on both the app and my phone I ve tried it with my VPN turned off and on but nothing works 
len ratingfour I m hoping the issue will either resolve itself or there will be another update soon to fix this problem because I really don t want to have to start using safari 
len ratingone  I ve used chrome for as long as I can recall but now it s been buggy and closing all my tabs regardless of if it s incognito or not 
len ratingone Initially it started out as a problem by aromatically closing my incognito tabs but now it s just closing everything 
len ratingone I ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling but still nothing 
len ratingone Is there any fix for this 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingone  app 
len ratingtwo i like how every time you go on incognito restart the app it doesn t save the tabs 
len ratingtwo it goes back to the old new tab Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingtwo With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingtwo my tabs keep getting closed and it s super annoying and inconvenient bc i have to keep remembering what i had opened please fix this
len ratingone Whenever I exit the Chrome app any incognito pages tabs that I have open disappear 
len ratingone And of course since it s incognito there s no way of getting those pages back 
len ratingone This only started happening with the most recent update 
len ratingone I ve deleted and reinstalled still happening 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX THIS Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone With the latest update incognito mode on Chrome for iOS made a change to better protect user privacy by discarding open incognito tabs when Chrome is closed from your recently used apps 
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingone  Every version gets buggier and crashes more 
len ratingone Edit The newest version locks up instead of crashing so progress 
len ratingone Not really 
len ratingfive It s a good app
len ratingone Lost the ability to switch between open windows with last update when I try the screen goes black and I have to close the app and go back in to the app to go to another window
len ratingone  This current update has been giving me issues when i switch between tabs as it will freeze the tab in blackness like if opened and incognito tab and my Incognito tabs all erased when i had to reopen tab now before it would just freeze and be back at incognito tab but now incognito tab also closes and these are all issues I experienced
len ratingone Now every time u hit on more results and scroll thru and find a link and click it when u click back it goes to the beginning level of the search results so u have to hit more as many times as it took u to get to that article video picture what have u 
len ratingone Either u need to go back to multiple pages or u need to have it so that when u hit the back arrow it goes to the result it left off from no matter how far down in result it was 
len ratingone Thai is a HUGE oversight and inconvenience 
len ratingone Pls fix ASAP 
len ratingfive  iPad 
len ratingone So this update of Chrome has given me numbers for when I am writing in a forum or in a message I would like to ask Why Why was this a necessary addition 
len ratingone I know it s Chrome because Safari doesn t do this nonsense All it does is make it impossible for me to select all content it makes me have to keep closing the app if I accidentally make a typo because guess what I can t delete any typos if I go back in the sentence 
len ratingone What kind of nonsense is this 
len ratingone What was the necessity 
len ratingone Who asked for this 
len ratingone I want it gone 
len ratingone I want to write in forums like normal 
len ratingone I should be able to select all if I want to 
len ratingthree  IPhone 
len ratingone I loved this app until the update I installed today I usually keep all my tabs open incognito because I don t like the auto fill suggestions from history the browsers kept 
len ratingone Now every time I open the app all my incognito tabs are closed 
len ratingone Very disappointing to say the least
len ratingone iPhone SE with most current iOS 
len ratingone Makes some sites difficult or impossible to use when you can t switch to desktop view 
len ratingfour Sorry for the negative review about the video player problem the site just had an outage on their video system but they got it all fixed 
len ratingfour The app is currently working great now 
len ratingone Chrome is no longer keeping private tabs and its closing them every time you close it 
len ratingone This is a useless and crappy app now 
len ratingone Switching to Firefox 
len ratingfive  yes going jyouojzhu 
len ratingone The current version closes all open incognito tabs if you close the app 
len ratingone There was no warning about this behavior 
len ratingone I lost several open tabs that had information I needed 
len ratingone I d deliberately opened them in incognito because I didn t want the information stored in history and synced to the cloud only locally 
len ratingone All gone 
len ratingone Thanks google 
len ratingfive I like the fact that it shows me the top stories once I pull it up 
len ratingthree That stinks 
len ratingthree  Chrome developers should put some efforts into writing better quality code 
len ratingthree I understand that it s hard to write an app that never crashes but it is definitely possible to to write something that doesn t crash several times a day 
len ratingone Right now it is really annoying to save bookmarks 
len ratingone My Bookmark Bar has main folders and subfolders yes I just counted plus hundreds of actual bookmarked sites 
len ratingone The bookmarked sites don t show up while I try to save a new bookmark but the subfolders do 
len ratingone So if I need to save a new bookmark this app forces me to scroll past ALL of my folders and subfolders which this app alphabetizes meaning they are NOT arranged in the order I have them on desktop to FIND the folder I want to Save Bookmark in 
len ratingone This is ridiculous 
len ratingone I would LOVE to be able to FIRST select one of the main folders in my Bookmarks Bar and THEN scroll to the correct subfolder and simply save the new bookmark 
len ratingone Funny enough this is the EXACT system you have in place for FINDING a bookmark that I ve already saved 
len ratingone Sooo you have a great system in place for FINDING a bookmark but SAVING A NEW ONE is a nightmare 
len ratingone If you could find it in your hearts to update this I d be hugely grateful 
len ratingthree Does the new update remove the search image function 
len ratingthree It s the only reason I use the chrome app so 
len ratingthree I know it was removed because Getty are lil b es but it s one thing safari doesn t offer 
len ratingthree I ll let it sit till I aw an answer 
len ratingone Don t like that I have to retype in my search EVERYTIME I go back to the previous page please fix
len ratingone All my incognito pages were closed down 
len ratingone I can only browse through non incognito mode which I hate cause I have to constantly erase my search history 
len ratingthree I m not exactly sure which version of chrome I was using before I decided to give in and update I m a firm believer of if it s not broken don t fix it but I decided that it had been long enough and an update was on order 
len ratingthree Big mistake 
len ratingthree The cosmetic changes aka the list of articles at the bottom of the new tab screen which function just like twitters search page I can just go on twitter for that 
len ratingthree I m willing to overlook but history and bookmarks no longer being able to stay open as their own page 
len ratingthree I guess this wouldn t be as big of an issue if it wasn t for the fact that the app is constantly crashing 
len ratingthree Before I updated crashes were few and far in between and I m the type of person that sometimes has like tabs open but now I ll have tabs open switch over to twitter and come back to just the chrome logo and the app refusing to open 
len ratingthree Which brings me to the next issue when the app crashes it no longer gives me the restore tabs option 
len ratingthree What 
len ratingthree So now I have to go to history and search for each website link one by one because A the history page forces me to hit done if I want to view a different tab and B when I select a link in history and choose the open in new tab option it ll automatically close out the history page all on its own once the new page opens 
len ratingthree WHY 
len ratingthree After I just spent forever searching through days and days worth of links just to find once specific page I had open 
len ratingthree I never review apps but I m honestly just so frustrated because I ve been using chrome ever since it was first released back in and on my smartphone as soon as I got one and have never had any major issues until now 
len ratingthree Honestly I m willing to ignore everything if the app would just STOP CRASHING every days and closing out all my of tabs without giving me the restore option 
len ratingthree  I am annoyed 
len ratingtwo  Recent update has an address bar bug where it is not responsive when attempting to edit the URL type a new one or copy paste 
len ratingtwo The page works and can scroll as well as tapping the top to get a scroll up effect but the rest of the address bar is dead 
len ratingtwo Sometimes it wakes up for no reason and other times I need to restart the browser 
len ratingtwo Very annoying and time consuming 
len ratingtwo Also a sight typing lag 
len ratingtwo Feels like google has been overloading this once light app with too much stuff 
len ratingtwo Very heavy 
len ratingtwo Otherwise still far better than all other browsers 
len ratingtwo I wish it continues to rule 
len ratingtwo It will as long as Google listens 
len ratingtwo No offense google but I don t want an Android experience on my iPhone 
len ratingone New update deleted all my open incognito tabs and deletes them every time you exist Chrome now 
len ratingone This is the second time a Chrome update has done this 
len ratingone Guess I m sticking with Safari 
len ratingone Bye bye Chrome 
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Fast accurate
len ratingthree I use chrome because I have it on all my other devices and it works great generally 
len ratingthree The thing that drives me nuts is that it works WORSE if I have gboard installed 
len ratingthree The color schemes of the keyboard doesn t match that big banner Chrome puts above the native keyboard 
len ratingthree And since there s no way to remove the banner now literally HALF the screen on my iPhone X is taken over by the keyboard including large areas at gray space 
len ratingthree Just not good 
len ratingthree Fix this 
len ratingone  Works horribly on iPhone X Can t move tabs around content often doesn t center properly in landscape mode 
len ratingfive Profile Photos Archived Feb Public
len ratingfour  chrome 
len ratingone I love using this app better than Safari but simple save and copy isn t possible anymore 
len ratingone Google fix this 
len ratingone It s not rocket science 
len ratingone I know you guys know that 
len ratingtwo  It keeps crashing and forcing way to many ads on me now 
len ratingtwo  pc 
len ratingone Since getting an iPhone and with popups off in chrome I still get many popups stating congratulations I ve won something 
len ratingone Doesn t happen in Safari Or my Galaxy S
len ratingone  It s unbelievable that in Google Chrome there is no Google cloud print option just as there is on chrome on android chrome on desktop Mac and chrome on desktop PC 
len ratingone Additionally the lack of timely improvements updates development on iOS chrome is unacceptable however it seems in the past two or three years this is the case on just about all Google products 
len ratingone Google seems to have stopped innovating and improving updating it s various products and instead now focuses on being about as good as other products companies such as Apple and playing catch up when they release new functionality or features 
len ratingone Look at Gmail when was the last time it received any updates or new features 
len ratingone What about Gsuite biz enterprise 
len ratingone or Google Drive docs personal 
len ratingone Updates are few and far between and chrome on iOS is another example of this 
len ratingtwo I like to use a variety of browsers depending on where I am what I m looking for etc but when I enter a domain name with at least a partial name I am NOT interested in receiving search engine results I expect to be able to just deal with that site rather than sift through all that search engine garbage Please give me the option somehow 
len ratingtwo I would be tempted to use Chrome a lot more often
len ratingone Chrome fails to ask me to update my password every time I log in forcing to manually type in the password every time
len ratingtwo Google Chrome has always worked pretty well giving fast and relevant results on searches no real complaints until recently 
len ratingtwo Not sure if it s only me but I have come across a problem where my searches won t load the one purpose of the app but now it just isn t working 
len ratingtwo I still haven t found the real problem I have full bars on data and I ve used full bars on wifi tried on different wifi sources everything else on my phone works perfectly and as expected without an issue but regardless through all the troubleshooting I ve went through and checking settings within my phone and the app itself s settings I can t get an explaining for why it just busted unexpectedly 
len ratingtwo I haven t installed an update on my phone for a while so that couldn t be what s tampering with it so I m just stuck 
len ratingtwo This started around yesterday so it s a fairly new problem 
len ratingtwo Like I said I ve done all the troubleshooting I could but it s simply just the app not working 
len ratingtwo I can open the app open close windows do anything on the main screen of a new tab although as soon as I type in something anything it will do the blank white screen as if it s loading a page for results I can see the URL at the top but alas no results 
len ratingtwo I ve waited a solid few minutes on it to load every time I put in a search but after awhile it gives me the took too long and try again stuff and of course after trying again and again no change in results 
len ratingtwo I really like the app it was doing a job well done until this problem arose for me 
len ratingtwo I m just going to leave this review so maybe it ll be noticed and fixed in the meantime I ll be looking around on my laptop for some answers 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive It has all the programming I watch 
len ratingfive News pro sports college sports and more
len ratingone There is a huge security flaw in this app 
len ratingone If you sign into your google account then sign out there is no way to delete your account from your device 
len ratingone Then all it takes is one click to log back into your google account to expose EVERYTHING 
len ratingone This even bypasses factor authentication 
len ratingone DO NOT sign into your account through the app until it s fixed 
len ratingtwo Yall know yall app always freezes right 
len ratingtwo Its annoying as all get out waiting for it to either work or crash 
len ratingfive  Thank you for listening to your users 
len ratingfive I ve happily started using the app again 
len ratingone Love my Google I only use Chrome and Gmail for the everything and my iPhone just spontaneously deleted the Chrome app and I can t even open from the app store 
len ratingone Can t bear to use Safari much longer please help 
len ratingone  Chrome has lost track they support apples greed rather than usability of their app 
len ratingone They no longer support iOS which has millions of users left stranded without their browser 
len ratingone Not A smart business move 
len ratingone They are doing a great injustice to their users and advertisers 
len ratingone Please make older versions available for iOS and 
len ratingtwo I too have been bombarded by pop ups from Amazon on my iPad while trying to use google 
len ratingtwo Once I deleted it the pop ups stopped 
len ratingtwo I m using bing for searches and nothing is going wrong 
len ratingtwo I wish you could look into this Google 
len ratingtwo Very frustrating to have the page freeze up then deleting the sight only to have it start up again 
len ratingone Every time I try to look at an image from a place like a restaurant or a nature preserve it just brings me to page to report the image even though I never clicked the report button 
len ratingtwo Title says it all 
len ratingtwo So frustrating 
len ratingone  I am so disappointed with Chrome on iPad 
len ratingone It constantly crashes 
len ratingone I thought it was just me until I read the reviews in the App Store 
len ratingone I will uninstall chrome 
len ratingone Update new iPad same problem 
len ratingone I m done using chrome on my iPad 
len ratingone I m a Chrome fan however for the past six or so weeks about once a week I get a pop up telling me I ve won something 
len ratingone This pop up won t go away so I have to uninstall the app and then reinstall 
len ratingone Does this happen to others or just me 
len ratingfive It would be awesome to add a theme to your chrome app like you could on the desktop 
len ratingfive Something
len ratingone Gmail sends me to the Web via Chrome which crashes after about a minute or two 
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfive Wow it works good i like like that
len ratingfive  I didn t download it yet but I thing it loooks so good I searched for something like that long time ago

len ratingone It becomes unresponsive and the hijacked tab can t be dismissed safely

len ratingone Used it for a few days and it was fine 
len ratingone Slightly bummed that I couldn t open my already created home screen website icons in Chrome as I couldn t find a way to make it the default web browser 
len ratingone Then I was served that terrible forced redirect malware ad 
len ratingone  Congratulations Amazon user etc 
len ratingone popped up as a non dismissible iOS prompt graying out Chrome s chrome and the website behind it 
len ratingone The URL was redirected to some untrustworthy junk website 
len ratingone Chrome became unresponsive 
len ratingone I did not click on the OK button on the iOS prompt but I could not get Chrome to switch tabs away from the hijacker s junk website 
len ratingone Force closing Chrome did not return it to a responsive state 
len ratingone The only way to fix this impasse would be to click OK on the maliciously generated iOS prompt which I am disinclined to do 
len ratingone  WiFi G SSL 
len ratingfour I love using this app to do all of my daily to do s but whenever I type in the letter k the app crashes 
len ratingfour What s going on 
len ratingfive  But why 
len ratingfive  xx xx 
len ratingone I want to see my bookmarks page when I open a new tab 
len ratingone Terrible update withe needless changes to flow 
len ratingone Garbage 
len ratingone Constantly loses my tabs and won t let me restore 
len ratingone Absolutely pitiful of the google company 
len ratingfive  Caroilna
len ratingone Despite the claims of ad blocking this app can be hung by an unwanted pop up 
len ratingone If you don t want to click OK on the spam pop up Chrome is rendered unusable 
len ratingone Your only choice is to uninstall and reinstall 
len ratingone This is totally unacceptable 
len ratingone Tired of it so I deleted the app Permanently
len ratingtwo I have been using Chrome on iphone and ipad for a long time now but I am now experiencing more frequent lockups and crashing on the iphone and now I m seeing them on the ipad 
len ratingtwo Both are running the latest versions of iOS 
len ratingtwo It is making them unusable and I have been forced back onto other browsers 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingone I changed to Chrome in hopes of better site compatibility across desktop and iOS 
len ratingone The iOS version is rampant with pop ups that I never get on the desktop client going to the same websites 
len ratingone I d rather deal with a poorer browser experience with Safari than the pop up issue with Chrome 
len ratingthree I have had to uninstall and reinstall several times due to an item popping up telling me I have won Amazon gift card 
len ratingthree This only happens on Google Chrome and I don t know how to make it stop except to uninstall and reinstall very annoying 
len ratingthree Otherwise I m very happy with the app
len ratingfive I have given browsers like safari and Firefox a try but I find myself returning to chrome every time its very fast and reliable 
len ratingfive I ve never had a problem and no matter what it works perfectly 
len ratingthree  Can you please return the search by image option 
len ratingthree I use it a lot to find larger sizes of the same image because I need HD versions 
len ratingthree It no longer even says the sizes of the image and I really do need that feature 
len ratingthree Please and thank you 
len ratingone New update is total trash 
len ratingfive Love it Very useful application
len ratingone You can t use chromecast from this app 
len ratingone Come on it s 
len ratingone No one is going to spend dollars on Apple TV when chromecast is built into TVs these days 
len ratingone I want to be able tours my iPhone cast streaming sports games from Reddit to the tv 
len ratingone Come on guys 
len ratingone This is a must 
len ratingone Also pop up ads are a nightmare with this app 
len ratingfive Works fast and is great 
len ratingone Chrome works on my computer but every time i try to reach a website most ones it says ERR FAILED And that is why I do not like Chrome on my iPad AVOID THIS APP 
len ratingfive  it is good
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingone Self explanatory
len ratingfour All they need to do now is add themes especially a dark theme so people can use it in the dark better and more customizing 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingtwo Great multi device sync though 
len ratingfive  It work completely well 
len ratingfive  Open in new tab lets you continue where you are without taking you out 
len ratingfive Works fast and D Touch is pretty cool with this app 
len ratingfive  Nice
len ratingfive Very useful app
len ratingfive  vv vghbvvvrryh v vv v vv v vvv vv vv bbvvfdgvvvv
len ratingone  No duckduckgo as default search 
len ratingone DEALBREAKER 
len ratingone Bookmarks awkward worthless 
len ratingone No home page 
len ratingone DEALBREAKER 
len ratingone No settings to avoid website tracking 
len ratingone  DEALBREAKER Nothing over Safari except fewer syllables in its name 
len ratingfive Best platform
len ratingthree Over all its an okay app but the whole reason I downloaded this was to use my chrome extensions 
len ratingthree You guys need to add extension support asap 
len ratingfive Great browser
len ratingone  free apps free software all require a signin with and for google to harvest each and every activity personal data and interests for the express purpose of farming you to become more powerful and gain more control 
len ratingone Google doesn t even pretend to be altruistic they are anti family anti children anti America anti Christian pro every other country and race but the who created this all 
len ratingone Go away google we are sick of you 
len ratingfive Chrome is thoughtfully designed and executed in every respect 
len ratingfive It s the ultimate safe bet in a universe of poorly designed software 
len ratingfive RB Monterey California
len ratingfive  chrome
len ratingfive Good 
len ratingfive Good browser 
len ratingone  Normally I love Chrome 
len ratingone It is usually my go to browser 
len ratingone But its icon has disappeared from my phone and it does nothing when I go to open in settings or the App Store 
len ratingone I have tried shutting by my phone off and turning it back on 
len ratingone Didn t help 
len ratingone Without the icon I can t even try to uninstall then reinstall 
len ratingfive  awesome
len ratingfive App
len ratingfour Excellent search engine
len ratingfive Best browser around
len ratingone Add me into the mix where I randomly get malicious pop ups with no option but to delete the entire app 
len ratingfour  I m very impressed with the obvious improvements made to the Google Chrome app for iOS 
len ratingfour I would much prefer to move entirely off Safari as I am a voracious Google product user Photos Docs Email Maps Calendar more but would not have given untethering from iOS Safari before now 
len ratingfour As we have begun using Google Home more and more I ve been looking for ways to better exploit Google Assistant on my iPhone 
len ratingfour With Ad Blocking a limitation in Safari good but not great and with Google s new ad blocking features rolling out this week I ve been trying to give iOS Chrome a second look 
len ratingfour I like it much more now 
len ratingfour I do wish however that the navigation controls were more like Safari s and at the bottom of the screen not the top 
len ratingfour Imitation is a good form of flattery certainly but even more important in UX UI so I would greatly encourage more of that design borrowing 
len ratingfive Always meets my needs 
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingfive Very easy to use highly recommended it google you rock 
len ratingfour Chrome has some little things that make it a bit annoying to use like the inability to easily open bookmarks in bulk though desktop has this issue too and the app is prone to crashing 
len ratingfour Still it s far better than other browser apps such as the one pre loaded onto iPhones and I enjoy the ability to switch quickly between tabs 
len ratingfive  uc 
len ratingfour I love it 
len ratingfour There could be some improvements though 
len ratingfive  emmmmmm
len ratingthree  This review is more for hoping that developers will see it than anything 
len ratingthree The latest update 
len ratingthree It s ruined the image searching for me to an even worse degree than it already had been I rely on images for so many things that it s been a hindrance 
len ratingthree The image search is either broken or so different from what I m used to that I can t manage to make it work 
len ratingthree When you touch an image on the thumbnail view all other images get a dark out filter overlay this might not be so bad if there was adequate spacing between the images that allowed for scrolling without accidentally activating this feature that isn t remotely helpful to begin with so frequently 
len ratingthree Most of the time that I try to unselect an image so that I can scroll through more it takes me to the web results page instead 
len ratingthree It s wonky and even if I figure out how to make it work smoother I do not like the new format 
len ratingthree Several updates ago image searches took a nosedive rather than being able to tilt my phone see images I ve selected full sized like I was accustomed to handy for seeing details of maps or whatever else I m looking for they instead got smaller with more of the browser border around them 
len ratingthree That was bad enough 
len ratingthree But this new thumbnail view makes it all the more frustrating 
len ratingthree I m of the mindset that things that are not broken should not be fixed wish that so many developers would be keen on that concept too 
len ratingthree As for the browser in general I have used Chrome for a long time both on my phone and desktop because I find Safari to be clunky and inconvenient 
len ratingthree I prefer most of the features that Chrome offers and for the most part that is still true 
len ratingthree I will not stop using it because of my image search issues but I m hoping that they go back to what I m used to preferably back to when landscape view showed me BIGGER versions of the images not smaller ones but I d settle for the thumbnail page going back to something easily usable 
len ratingone  Why am I suddenly getting searches saved 
len ratingthree  iphone 
len ratingthree Any update wont go smoothly there is always an error
len ratingtwo Crashes continually on all devices 
len ratingtwo Should be better for a company with such a big stock price and what they say are top notch techies working for them 
len ratingfour  chrome 
len ratingfive  Alright so it says for the age rating 
len ratingfive I don t know if something happened for this to happen it s not a serious issue I m just wondering why this happened 
len ratingfive  This is one of the few browsers I use and I just think it is the best I use
len ratingfour I love this app it s just that I think Google Chrome should have a private tab searching setting
len ratingone Chrome 
len ratingone I can t see what I m typing because the keyboard covers up the entire screen 
len ratingone Maybe if they hired competent programmers like how they need to hire competent customer service people they would make something that actually works 
len ratingfive Mama miaaa 
len ratingfive This app is a gooda 
len ratingfive  SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGHET 
len ratingtwo First off I really like chrome 
len ratingtwo It has been my go to browser since it s first release but since I went to the iphone x it jumps around the webpages 
len ratingtwo Making it very difficult to read the information 
len ratingtwo If I swipe up or down it will go to the top or bottom of the page 
len ratingtwo No incremental movement 
len ratingtwo Also I noticed most websites no longer fit on the screen 
len ratingtwo Just a very frustrating experience all the way around 
len ratingthree PLEASE add a home button 
len ratingthree Not having one is really annoying and wasting my time 
len ratingthree I ll be using Safari until you do 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone Hahaha
len ratingthree I would like to choose which links appear on the initial new tab screen 
len ratingone Google your user experiences are horrible 
len ratingone Even your own employees hate your UX 
len ratingone Stop putting your horrible Android UX in iOS apps 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingone Slow constantly freezing garbage 
len ratingone Absolutely hate it 
len ratingfive  pc 
len ratingone Yesterday I get email and I have to pay from google chrome 
len ratingone What the hell 
len ratingone I don t use this app for longer 
len ratingone And this is scam email from AppleID and google chrome 
len ratingone If you download and will get email later and you pay from google chrome 
len ratingone Never heard before 
len ratingone Always freezes up then closes all tabs
len ratingfour Chrome is better than safari in that I can watch porn again 
len ratingfive Excited about the new read later features 
len ratingfive Another one of my favorite apps 
len ratingfive I recommend trying it
len ratingtwo Despite the fact that I have checked my settings numerous times and have block pop ups enabled I continue to be bombarded by quite obviously malicious pop ups 
len ratingtwo The only options I have are to press ok and quickly close the tab that is now open to a malicious site or completely delete the app every time that happens about every seconds on certain sites 
len ratingtwo I used to love using this app for all of my internet browsing but it has been rendered unusable 
len ratingtwo Constantly getting pop ups on wikipedia pages and articles from reputable sources which I have no problems with on my computer is absolutely unacceptable 
len ratingtwo I love google products and the company and if this problem is fixed then I will most certainly continue using this app as my main browser but for now I simply cannot because I have to protect my device and my security 
len ratingtwo Truly disappointing 
len ratingone  The current version of the app won t run unless I m connected to WiFi 
len ratingone If I m not I just get error messages even with full LTE 
len ratingone Great app but until it works when not connected to WiFi there s no way I can rate it above 
len ratingone Update months later and this issue still isn t fixed 
len ratingone I enjoy using Google and it s products but this is ridiculous 
len ratingone Installed Firefox and it s running much smoother and is actually reliable 
len ratingone Make the switch Kings we deserve better 
len ratingtwo App crashes constantly and I often need to take tries to read one web page 
len ratingtwo Horribly developed 
len ratingone Crashes within seconds of opening Freezes have to restart Trash 
len ratingone  Lol
len ratingtwo My app disappeared and im not able to install from app store
len ratingfive  Good 
len ratingone Not seconds after opening this app everything freezes and I have to manually close the app 
len ratingone DONT KNOW WHAT GOOGLE DID IN LAST UPDATE BUT IT BROKE MY CHROME
len ratingfour Mediocre
len ratingfour Updated Feb Thanks for the response 
len ratingfour I appreciate the inclusion of the button to hide the ads articles 
len ratingfour That wasn t always there 
len ratingfour Original review Google is now forcing me to view its list of suggested articles 
len ratingfour A feature that formerly was something you could disable is now forced on the user 
len ratingfour Worse yet many of the articles it suggests are loaded with adware malware redirects and you ve won an Amazon Gift Card pop ups 
len ratingfour I ve already downloaded Firefox and plan to switch if this doesn t get reversed soon 
len ratingfour  Update Feb Yes we just added that option in this release Thank you 
len ratingfour Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfour You can tap Chrome menu and then Settings and turn off Article Suggestions 
len ratingone Also sent feedback via Google app Deleted this app for now because controls to permanently hide headlines and the associated thumbnails failed to work properly even after relaunching the app as recommended by the Developer 
len ratingone I ll be using Safari or Firefox until this is fixed 
len ratingone  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone You can tap Chrome menu and then Settings and turn off Article Suggestions 
len ratingfive Great for anything from recipes to historical dates 
len ratingfive Easy go to app for search 
len ratingfive Always use
len ratingthree I love using google and it has been one off my favorite app on the iPhone now it s seems like it very slow and steady but off and always slowly logs me off
len ratingone  Since the latest update it is constantly glitching 
len ratingone Almost unusable
len ratingone Crashes frequently loses all tabs when it does so and also occasionally causes my phone to overheat leading to it to freeze up completely 
len ratingfour I prefer the Chrome ui over Safari and synchronizing tabs and bookmarks between desktop and mobile is a handy feature for me 
len ratingone I did everything suggested to stop those pop up ads that have taken over my browser literally could not get out of it unless I click go or uninstall Chrome and they just kept coming back non stop 
len ratingone This thing suddenly places ad pop ups where only OK can be agreed too 
len ratingone Bye 
len ratingthree Whenever I search and then tap images the translator constantly tells me the page is in Brazilian Portuguese and offers to translate 
len ratingone The browser freezes and must be restarted 
len ratingone After restart all tabs are gone 
len ratingone Terrible update to a browser that keeps getting worse on all platforms 
len ratingfive I really love Chrome 
len ratingfive It s intuitive and I appreciate the syncing across devices 
len ratingfive My suggestion is to add the tap hold zooming on web pages as it is implemented in Google Maps 
len ratingfive That would aid in page navigation and readability immensely 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingone Can t view enlarged images when I tap on the image I m brought a small set of options I just want to enlarge the pics for viewing 
len ratingone Before I could tap on the image it would go full screen and then bordered by black now I get options like visit share and save 
len ratingone Bring back the old feature 
len ratingone  Hi I am trying to sound nice but I am mad right now 
len ratingone Before I got this app my add free games were fine 
len ratingone Then I got this app and all of the sudden pop up adds started showing up 
len ratingone The ones with the grey background 
len ratingone These are some actual ones best car accident lawyers create a Facebook profile now 
len ratingone And even after I deleted it the ads still popped up 
len ratingone This app stinks 
len ratingone Get the regular google 
len ratingone Deleting my review and Article suggest every time I turn it off it will turn itself back on Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone You can tap Chrome menu and then Settings and turn off Article Suggestions 
len ratingone  This browser is useless 
len ratingone It lacks a bookmarks bar 
len ratingone The only way to access bookmarks is to press a button the more button then press bookmarks then press the folder the bookmarks are in then press the bookmark 
len ratingone Yep four steps to access a bookmark 
len ratingone It s hard to imagine a more worthless product 
len ratingone Utter garbage 
len ratingone I d give it zero stars if I could 
len ratingfour I don t want to keep this app no more because it loads slow even with videos I never will redownload this app after I delete it 
len ratingtwo If you can t select a home page why have it at all waste of time 
len ratingone App will freeze up causing me to delete and reinstall 
len ratingone Tried freeing up memory cache etc 
len ratingone With Apple s planned obsolescence for iPhones this app is slower than a Cupertino traffic jam 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingone  star is too generous 
len ratingone How do I delete this from my iPad
len ratingthree Good App but this whole news suggestion thing needs to go 
len ratingthree We don t want to be bombarded with news when we open the app to search something 
len ratingfour  not bad
len ratingthree Works well for the most part but recently when I open a new tab and start typing in the url it redirects me to random webpages which is really annoying 
len ratingthree Went to a list of my certs and trying to download one as a pdf but it says error when trying to Open in and look even Safari has this problem kinda but it worse in Safari see it won t even load the page so there nothing to DL in it Chrome would ve give star maybe but look this error always happen when try to DL so i will then give it star instead 
len ratingthree And now it won t download when I go to the app store
len ratingthree I don t want that suggested content 
len ratingthree I certainly don t want Foxnews suggestions 
len ratingthree The most used icons don t work anymore either 
len ratingthree I ve reported this multiple times to Google and nothing is ever fixed 
len ratingthree I ve switched over to Safari and Bing 
len ratingthree  Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree You can tap Chrome menu and then Settings and turn off Article Suggestions 
len ratingone It s the worst browser app ever existed 
len ratingone Half a time it does not load at all and the other half crashes constantly 
len ratingone The funny part is instead of fixing it Google has chosen to ignore its browser s issues 
len ratingthree When getting driving directions from Chrome being launched into Maps I can t select the Directions button lower right button to start receiving directions 
len ratingthree I found a work around by st looking at the turn by turn list lower left button THEN selecting the directions button upper right 
len ratingthree At least it works 
len ratingtwo  From the top browser competing for the mobile browser you expect best 
len ratingtwo With last update the crash lost me some data 
len ratingtwo I d prefer less features over stability from now on 
len ratingfive They finally let you disable the stupid news suggestions 
len ratingfive Yay
len ratingfive Hi after new updating I can t show routs 
len ratingfive There is some problems I suppose to solve it Thanks
len ratingone I noticed my phone kept getting hot my apps were crashing video was slow response to my touchscreen was delayed even when I m not using the app 
len ratingone When I deleted google chrome everything went back to normal 
len ratingone Delete this app from your phone 
len ratingfive  app chrome chrome app 
len ratingfour  I think its time to bring the Chrome Extensions to iOS devices 
len ratingfour Otherwise its good
len ratingone I m typing this on an iPhone S and now Chrome doesn t work I m done I m going back to Claw Web Surfer 
len ratingone Evil 
len ratingfour  x x bing 
len ratingtwo I used with lyft app and every time send me to California 
len ratingfive Absolutely the knob is perfect An perfect An great quality
len ratingone why cannot we copy imagess
len ratingfour Thank goodness Google allowed you to remove article suggestions with this update 
len ratingfour Those article suggestions were the worst 
len ratingfour EVERY SINGLE TIME I tried to type something in it would delete in the middle of typing then pull up the page of article suggestions 
len ratingfour It was the worst thing ever and I was almost done using Chrome which I love because of it 
len ratingfour Google NEVER DO THAT TO US AGAIN 
len ratingone Despite blocking pop ups clearing history etc the only way to stop recurring Congratulations ads seems to be to delete and reload the app 
len ratingone It s become unusable crap 
len ratingone Looking at Brave as reliable alternative 
len ratingfive Very Good
len ratingfive Love this app it s way better then safari and allows me to use my saved tabs from my pc
len ratingfive Chrome is about the best web browser for iPhone splus out there 
len ratingfive Most of the issues are user error 
len ratingfive No comment just wanted to be on here
len ratingthree Rating would be higher but I m consistently seeing an issue where I type a few letters in the search bar and then I m booted back to the home page totally wiping out anything I had just typed 
len ratingthree I also see that app updates come once a month soooo fingers crossed this next one includes this fix 
len ratingthree Because it s pretty frustrating 
len ratingone Folders bookmarks all in one list you need to find one particular bookmark you will have to go through the entire list it means if you have thousands of bookmark just like me You are not gonna find it anymore 
len ratingone Good job google 
len ratingthree Having the navigation back reload forward and page selector buttons would really help the browsing experience on larger iPhones 
len ratingtwo Update it so we can cast through chrome cast
len ratingtwo Runs fine until you encounter a page locking phishing scam 
len ratingtwo There s no way to close the window 
len ratingtwo Closing and restarting the app don t help either 
len ratingtwo I ve cleared the cache and nothing works except deleting the app 
len ratingtwo UNACCEPTABLE Google
len ratingfive This is my bestBrowserI always use it on my android and iOS devices
len ratingtwo the app itself is fine but i keep getting pop up spam that won t go away unless i click ok 
len ratingtwo it s a lot of those congrats you ve won blah blah blah and i m worried it s going to give my phone a virus or something 
len ratingtwo i m not positive if this is due to the app or something else but it s worrisome 
len ratingfour Google chrome is obviously a great app and you don t need me to tell you that 
len ratingfour However there as been one glitch lately that has been very annoying and the reason I am writing this review 
len ratingfour About of the time that I try to quickly google something as I m typing into the search bar my keyboard disappears making me accidentally click on the suggested news on the homepage 
len ratingfour This gets very annoying when I am attempting to quickly google something and I do believe the problem is in the app as my phone doesn t do this on any other app 
len ratingfour Please help me with this so I can love Google Chrome again 
len ratingone My phone is up to date on latest software 
len ratingone I always update my apps 
len ratingone I also use my internet for basic searching 
len ratingone Im always safe to not go on sketchy websites 
len ratingone These last few months almost every other day as I browse the internet my screen gets taken over by a free giftcard iphone prize offer I cant exit the screen or close the window 
len ratingone I have to uninstall google chrome and or have to restart my phone
len ratingone Decent browser 
len ratingone Frequent full page ads make the browser almost unusable 
len ratingone Very Bad 
len ratingone Why did you remove the bookmark page 
len ratingone For those who have lots of bookmarks a little pop up is not better than an actual tab that we can see all of our stuff 
len ratingone I ve used this browser for every single phone I ve had from low end androids to my current iPhone 
len ratingone It s been a good app for a while but now I run into nothing but problems from it not being responsive on YouTube to not being responsive on Facebook no matter how many times I click on anything 
len ratingone Needless to say I will not be download this pos again and it s lost all credibility from me as an app 
len ratingone I will however still use it on my computer because I haven t ran into problems on there 
len ratingone But it just kept getting worse and worse on my phone so I finally got rid of it and now I m using safari 
len ratingtwo  Freezes ALL the time 
len ratingtwo On my desktop I prefer Chrome because Firefox has become as slow as IE but on my phone I m tending to use FF more and more because Chrome constantly freezes 
len ratingthree While Google Chrome is a great browser and works just fine for me it s iPhone X support is kind of wonky 
len ratingthree So it is a full screen app but when you turn your phone to landscape that gray bar that is used to fill in the notches does not disappear 
len ratingthree So while you are browsing with your phone on it s side there is an ugly and blank gray bar across the top that serves no purpose 
len ratingone  Until I can block egregious ads like the ones on Vox sites then I m not using Chrome as my default browser 
len ratingone Other then that it s a great browser 
len ratingfour  ill give this a star rating bc its like a different version of google bc we all know that google came first but i like that you have incognito mode bc i act like a spy 
len ratingfour jk i dont 
len ratingone Please get rid of the suggested content 
len ratingone This is a browser and not a news service 
len ratingone I don t like the lack of controls over this stuff that is a distraction but dosent enhance our life in any way 
len ratingone I m not sure what problem or need that actually even fixes 
len ratingone  I like the google maps integration allowing me to open directions straight in google maps 
len ratingone Plus all book marks are synced from chrome on my computer too Great app to have if you use chrome or have a google account 
len ratingone Chrome is poised to be a true game changer in the world of computing and I m happy to see it developing 
len ratingone  iOS 
len ratingone A pop up stating something like Congratulations 
len ratingone You just won 
len ratingone Click OK to redeem cannot be closed with your app 
len ratingone Instead of creating a way to clear the cache or close all tabs outside of the app through iOS settings you have to completely uninstall and reinstall 
len ratingone Please fix this and I will give stars 
len ratingone Some sites open an intrusive pop up for a free iPad etc that can t be cleared without a re install 
len ratingone I m getting really tired of re installing to clear the pop up 
len ratingone An option to open to a blank screen instead of all previously open windows including the problem pop up should be possible 
len ratingone Till then star 
len ratingtwo Google Chrome has a wide variety of extensions yet none of them are comparable with mobile device 
len ratingone I d give chrome for the iPad a zero if I could 
len ratingone Why not give us the choice on how we want our bookmarks to be displayed 
len ratingone The old way of displaying and organizing bookmarks was so much better 
len ratingone I wish I could revert back to an earlier version of chrome or have the option to use the old method of displaying and organizing my bookmarks 
len ratingone I will never update my other devices with Chrome 
len ratingone I m sorry I updated one of my devices with it 
len ratingone The Google team use to be so great 
len ratingone Their products get worse and worse 
len ratingone Have in app problem for some time on iphone when I try to open more option three dot icon it will open but will be invisible so I have to press randomly based on luck and memory now can t create bookmarks etc 
len ratingfour  perfect Safari YouTube APP YouTube APP 
len ratingthree Sometimes there is this pop up add that forces you to click yes and you can t get rid of it 
len ratingthree Not sure if it s the browsers fault though but most likely 
len ratingthree It s really annoying 
len ratingfour Please add always show bookmarks bar on ipad
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingtwo Contrary to what many search engines believe I do not want to be bombarded with news all of the time 
len ratingtwo Chrome now has headlines when a new tab is opened 
len ratingtwo Thus far I ve not found an easy way to disable unless I use incognito 
len ratingtwo I definitely prefer using google but not if this is the case 
len ratingtwo Browser is decent and basic nothing better than Safari 
len ratingtwo I had high hopes for syncing my bookmarks and tabs between devices but if you have more than Gmail account it s a nightmare trying to switch between them 
len ratingtwo Maybe the app is just broken but I ve tried about times to sign into another account and it still rolls back to the previous 
len ratingfour I love the Chrome app but I hate the desktop app 
len ratingfour I m looking at using Firefox on my laptop but the app for that looks bad 
len ratingfour The browser is nice and clean 
len ratingfour I love having personalized news articles on the start screen 
len ratingfour Safari was unbearable so I had to switch to this 
len ratingfour It seemed cleaner than the Firefox app which I have yet to try out 
len ratingone This app stays in my cloud 
len ratingone Can t open anymore 
len ratingone What s up with that 
len ratingthree  Really wish you could use find in page on a PDF
len ratingone App now does not work 
len ratingone Either freezes or crashes upon load up 
len ratingone I was reading an article straight off of Chrome when a message popped up saying I won an Amazon gift card 
len ratingone Suspicious of it I wanted to decline but there wasn t a button to do so 
len ratingone Clicking on the home button did nothing 
len ratingone Double clicking the home button and closing Chrome then reopening it brought me back to the same screen 
len ratingone Doing the same steps and and shutting down the phone didn t clear it either 
len ratingone Only deleting Chrome and reinstalling it cleared the message 
len ratingone This seems to be a serious bug because the only other option was to click ok and be sent to who knows where 
len ratingone As many have stated there is no way around no clicking on unsafe pop ups in chrome other than to delete the app and reinstall which is cumbersome if you have info saved in cache passwords cc info etc 
len ratingone Completely unusable in this current version 
len ratingone I just want a browser that lets me use one set of bookmarks across all browsers with the latest release i can t find my bookmarks 
len ratingone I m sure they are there somewhere but why do i have to look 
len ratingone This one little issue caused me to rethink my planned phone upgrade to the pixel going with Samsung now 
len ratingone Terrible app 
len ratingone This app won t scroll on websites 
len ratingone It allows pop ups that you cannot remove unless you delete the app 
len ratingone Walmart etc 
len ratingone Terrible thanks Microsoft you are terrible
len ratingfour  SSL 
len ratingone It s become extremely annoying to always get kicked out of the navigation bar for the most recent news articles on the New Tab page 
len ratingone This never used to happen but now every time I open a tab and start typing it erases everything and opens one of the articles displayed on the page 
len ratingone I don t care about the articles and it s caused me to use Safari or Opera instead 
len ratingone Please fix this or give me an option to remove the news from the page 
len ratingthree Not sure what the thinking behind the hangs to images search was but it ruined browsing images on mobile for me 
len ratingthree Searching something in images shows low quality photos and tapping on an image doesn t show you the image anymore 
len ratingthree Really frustrating to view high resolution images and save them 
len ratingthree Share button is not necessary here 
len ratingthree And the same image button

len ratingone After reading the Damore document I think it s time to un Google my life and adapt an all Apple approach to life 
len ratingone Google is not worthy of anyone s business 
len ratingone What a train wreck 
len ratingthree I ve always had Android phones and I own two laptops 
len ratingthree One s a Chromebook and the other is a laptop with the Linux operating system 
len ratingthree I have an iPhone now and Safari isn t working well on it 
len ratingthree So I m going to give Chrome a try on this phone 
len ratingthree If it doesn t work out you ll be the first to know 
len ratingone Jjj
len ratingfive I mean just applause to google for completely slaughtering bing like what s bing 
len ratingfive I do not know 
len ratingfive Like the only other browser that people still kinda know exists is safari and that s because it comes with iPhones even though no one wants it like that bs U album 
len ratingfive Honestly who even likes U anymore I m being honest when I say that I ve never heard one of their songs 
len ratingfive If you have applause to you for having such a long attention span because that stuff is BOORRINNG 
len ratingfive It s very sad though that we ve lost bing I think I will set up a funeral for them be right back BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR MY NEXT SCETCH THE FUNERAL OF BING 
len ratingfive Easy peasy
len ratingone Certain websites are not viewable in chrome 
len ratingone When I input a website URL I get a message saying This Site Can t Be Reached 
len ratingone At first this would only occur when I was using WiFi but now it occurs over cell data l It seems weird that I can access the same sites using safari on my phone or using a browser on my desktop 
len ratingthree There are popups that come up that will not allow you to navigate unless you click on their popup menu 
len ratingthree You have to delete the app and reload 
len ratingthree Incredibly annoying 
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingone  Google was once a place to find information 
len ratingone It had no bias 
len ratingone It was the modern day tool to educate yourself 
len ratingone Unfortunately Google has lost its way 
len ratingone Hiding factual information from users Turning up incorrect search Results that have nothing to do with what you re looking for 
len ratingone This is simply because google Will no longer share information it doesn t want you to know about 
len ratingone It s time for a change 
len ratingone Boycott google 
len ratingfour  IPAD 
len ratingfour the newest update causes the app to not close properly and ends up closing all of my tabs at least once a day also i hate the new feature where you can t click on images to view them and scroll through just the images without information please bring that back it s super annoying to not have
len ratingone Opening new tab goes glitchy 
len ratingone Disappears for a split second when opening
len ratingtwo  Chrome is ok for the most part but I downloaded it because I thought it would replace safari as an awesome browser 
len ratingtwo Well I was wrong 
len ratingtwo There are several issues that make it very annoying to use 
len ratingtwo For one requesting the desktop version of a site for all of the web sites I tried it simply takes me back to a mobile version of the page 
len ratingtwo I don t know what browser string it s sending but that doesn t I seem to change with this setting 
len ratingtwo Secondly scroll down to refresh is refreshingly stupid 
len ratingtwo There is plenty of the room on the URL bar which disappears so who cares what it looks like so why not put it there 
len ratingtwo If I m filling out a form and I need to scroll down and then accidentally go too far there goes all my hard work typing on my phone 
len ratingtwo This should be obvious to anyone who tested this at google so maybe they just ignore their user feedback 
len ratingtwo Also viewing bookmarks and navigating is now more cumbersome than ever 
len ratingtwo What once took one click now takes 
len ratingtwo This came with the latest December th update so what the heck are people at google thinking 
len ratingtwo Isn t there any quality control 
len ratingtwo Changing an interface just for the sake of change is a Microsoft thing not google 
len ratingtwo I don t as gong to buy a chrome book but after seeing this update I ll wait to see how things are ironed out 
len ratingtwo Oh and saving an image from a tab or window that only contains an image does not work 
len ratingtwo Why would this be 
len ratingtwo Is there something in the code that checks for this condition and then prevents me from downloading 
len ratingtwo Because otherwise it s just a heinous bug that should have been fixed months if not years ago 
len ratingtwo Finally it crashes and freezes 
len ratingtwo Not all the time but this does happen 
len ratingtwo NEVER with safari it is fast and stable 
len ratingtwo All of these things sadden me because I use chrome at home and it works so well 
len ratingtwo I d love to sync my bookmarks and passwords but because the mobile version is shoddy I can not do so 
len ratingtwo Google please fix these issues so that you can be my number one browser 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive I can find millions of things and apps best app ever
len ratingone Ever try to watch an animated gif on chrome 
len ratingone Well of the time not only does the file stop loading halfway through it kills the tab you are using 
len ratingone You can t go back type in a new address or reload the page 
len ratingone The only solution is to close the tab open a new one and find where you left off 
len ratingone This wouldn t be so bad if it only happened every so often but after the hundredth time you load a page ending with gif and it kills the tab while you re trying to do something important you gotta uninstall 
len ratingone  unsubscribe
len ratingone I open app and go to type in the search bar the app then freezes for about seconds then the app proceeds to crash 
len ratingone I can no longer use chrome as a result 
len ratingfive  vpn 
len ratingtwo To look up anything it s difficult To save images it s difficult Again not the best app
len ratingfour Unfortunately it seems like handoff between Chrome on Mac and on iOS isn t working anymore 
len ratingfour Having Chrome open on Mac suggests Safari on iOS while Chrome open on iOS causes no suggestions on Mac 
len ratingfour Otherwise this is a great browser with nice integration into other Google apps 
len ratingtwo Why did you decide to change the bookmark format 
len ratingtwo At one point all your bookmark folders were laid out to see 
len ratingtwo Now i have to scroll through a list of other bookmarks just to find one folder 
len ratingone I normally love Chrome on all my devices but sadly it never works on my iPad 
len ratingone When I m trying to read a new article or a website page is an adventure and often becomes frustrating 
len ratingone I lose my places the browser freezes 
len ratingone On top of that the browser will freeze and crash 
len ratingone I just want to use Chrome on my iPad Mini but I can t without being very frustrated 
len ratingfive Hi I thank you for this app 
len ratingone Chrome on iOS used to be a great alternative to Safari and others but now it s missing several key features such as the ability to configure the new tab page basic caching so that swiping backwards or forwards doesn t present a blank page and the ability to rearrange tabs 
len ratingone It really hurts Google you re so close to greatness 
len ratingfive  Google chrome syncs your information with all windows Mac and android devices running google chrome 
len ratingfive Chrome is really fast and convenient for those not fully embracing the Apple ecosystem if you will 
len ratingfive  gKurHJEZ
len ratingtwo UPDATE With the newest update the share function is nonexistent 
len ratingtwo Tapping on the share icon does absolutely nothing 
len ratingtwo Have quit and reopened the app many many times no difference 
len ratingtwo So terribly frustrating 
len ratingtwo Chrome is I huge part of my regular workflow but this problem absolutely stifles productivity 
len ratingtwo  With the latest update it is crashing constantly 
len ratingtwo The app has crashed seven times in the last three minutes 
len ratingone  I too have experienced the intrusive pop up 
len ratingone The only way to rid of it is by deleting the app altogether 
len ratingone Is Google testing the intellect of John Q 
len ratingone Public to see how far they will go to use their product 
len ratingone There are other browsers available I don t plan on sticking around as a pawn in Google s little game 
len ratingfive I am a fan of this iOS browser 
len ratingfive I m excited that Google has added a reading list 
len ratingfive It would be fantastic if they would add a reading list to the windows version so that I could sync and look at my list on all devices 
len ratingfive  uc uc 
len ratingfive  Bsjsjskwakw
len ratingthree The browser is functional but the number of settings appears to be limited 
len ratingthree How do you disable JavaScript on iOS 
len ratingone  don t fix it 
len ratingone Bookmarks were fine now I m not so sure 
len ratingone New default view is pathetic 
len ratingone Also seems to freeze on some web sites with too many ads videos playing talking to you cnn 
len ratingtwo  The new tab page went from sorta simple to absolute chaos 
len ratingtwo Not a great start to the browser and there s no way to disable it 
len ratingtwo How about quick access to our own bookmarks instead of feeding users paid articles 
len ratingtwo Oh because google would lose a penny for every second I stay on the tab page 
len ratingtwo Hello Safari 
len ratingone This is a good app with a fatal problem 
len ratingone If the app somehow is infiltrated by a pop up like some fraudulent prize you just won you have no way of making the pop up go away other than deleting the app and re installing it 
len ratingone Please fix this nuisance of a problem 
len ratingone Too many viruses 
len ratingone You can t set a homepage 
len ratingtwo Earlier today I was browsing and reading different online articles when the notification popped up congratulations lucky google user or whatever and I couldn t get it to go away 
len ratingtwo I exited I closed the tab and even opened up a new one and it would go away 
len ratingtwo I m tired of it 
len ratingone When swiping through google images you used to be able to tap the image to make it full size 
len ratingone That option is gone now 
len ratingone Now all i can do is zoom in awkwardly download it or visit the website 
len ratingone I generally don t want any of those things 
len ratingone I just want to look at a picture as full screen and continue on swiping through 
len ratingone Now when i tap the picture all that comes up is visit save or share blocking the picture anyway 
len ratingone Please fix this update I liked google perfectly how it was before 
len ratingtwo Unable to click on many features accessed through the upper right button vertical dots 
len ratingtwo Unable to click on setting history report issues etc 
len ratingtwo tried restating app phone and reinstalling 
len ratingtwo Seems to be issue with recent update 
len ratingtwo Beside that app has been mostly problem free in past years I used it 
len ratingfive  de hua mian
len ratingthree Syncing between devices etc 
len ratingthree unfortunately cannot get rid of obnoxious amazon card winner pop up despite having pop ups blocked 
len ratingthree This is the third time deleting and reinstalling app
len ratingtwo The feel of the app now when you look through your search results is very black and white the logos are nice but the font all blends in rather than looking like separate links
len ratingone Has a pop up 
len ratingone Congrats you just got some stupid crap
len ratingone I ended up deleting the chrome app because of all of the pop ups 
len ratingone Looking for alternative to Safari I downloaded Chrome and took it for a spin 
len ratingone Good impressions at first 
len ratingone Getting used to the UI layout and navigation took a me a while but I was getting better and then after two days of use BOOMMM I got a script pop up from a website and there was no way of getting rid of 
len ratingone Unlike on Safari where you have a way of dismissing the pop up without having to interact with it on Chrome that wasn t an option 
len ratingone I looked everywhere for a way to make it go away like cleared the browser cash closed and re opened but the app was completely locked up 
len ratingone The only solution was to click OK on the pop or just delete the app 
len ratingone So I deleted it and now I am back to Safari again 
len ratingone I ve tried clearing my history and my cache and uninstalling and reinstalling the app and I still get pop ups that won t allow me to continue on unless I say okay 
len ratingone Please bring back the ability to have all my folders at the top of my list 
len ratingone I use them all the time and to have to scroll down to them the way you have put them in chronological order basically makes the site unusable for me 
len ratingone I am using an iPad 
len ratingone Even better Is there some way we could have a choice on how the bookmarks are listed 
len ratingone Or actually be able to move the order around like a few versions ago 
len ratingone Now that was useable and what really brought me in as a regular user 
len ratingone If I could I would rate this a 
len ratingone I believe that a drunken raccoon could create a better application than google 
len ratingone Goodness this is horrible I try to look up a simple thing and error pops up every single time 
len ratingone Save your time and space on your phone and get Firefox 
len ratingthree The latest update has removed all access to Chrome extensions 
len ratingthree I ve even tried sharing them from my desktop to my iPad and they simply don t show 
len ratingthree I ve spoken with Apple Google and LastPass the extension I want to use and each says it s the other vendor s fault 
len ratingthree This last update was a complete bust and I don t recommend anyone use it until Google fixes it 
len ratingone  Used to be a great and streamlined browser now just like Facebook and everything else Every idiot and their blog is crammed down your throat 
len ratingone I don t want a news service I want a web browser 
len ratingfour Can t use custom search 
len ratingthree Chrome works great but I hate the suggested content feature 
len ratingthree It s never relevant and there doesn t seem to be a way to turn it off 
len ratingthree It s really annoying since I have to see these garbage articles almost every time I open the browser now 
len ratingtwo The app itself is great but the politics behind it is annoying 
len ratingtwo All I am seeing is left wing propaganda and nothing either neutral or right wing in the new news feed in the bottom of new tabs 
len ratingtwo Ridiculous 
len ratingone Only star as chrome will frequently crash or freeze on the iPad 
len ratingone Hope each new release fixes problem but does not 
len ratingone Instead it appears less features are present 
len ratingone Loss of save image as others have noted is not good 
len ratingone Will switch to using Firefox or even shudder Safari on the iPad as we are tired of losing time with the incessant crashing of chrome 
len ratingone Yes chrome has been deleted and re installed numerous times No relief 
len ratingone It also has a memory leak and becomes exceedingly large 
len ratingone Also have blown away and restored the IPAD No change or relief Chrome browser continues to crash and display the aw snap crash error screen 
len ratingone Mozilla needs to release Firefox Quantum for IOS devices 
len ratingone Make search and site suggestions separate options to turn on and off 
len ratingone I DON T like all the suggestions THAT APPEAR BELOW THE SEARCH BAR 
len ratingone I LIKE when you type in the search bar and google predicts the words you are typing Make it so you can turn on or off each one individually 
len ratingtwo Please give us the option to remove suggested news stories WITHOUT forcing us to also get rid of search suggestions 
len ratingtwo I don t need to be blasted with headlines every time I open the browser 
len ratingthree Operates just fine in any other context but I keep having to delete and redownload because of invasive pop ups on websites that i have no trouble with on my laptop 
len ratingthree these pop ups don t happen on safari and appear on wikia or database type sites that as stated before give me no trouble elsewhere 
len ratingthree These pop ups basically have no way of closing them other than to delete the app itself and redownload 
len ratingthree this is the only problem ive encountered but it gets more annoying every time i have to deal with it 
len ratingthree Please make this app more secure 
len ratingtwo I ve been hoping for long time that google will fix the rendering freezes when scrolling large pages or pinch resizing them Very simple tire produce open an opinion article in CNN with comments and the browser is useless 
len ratingtwo I keep using because it caches my typical URLs but getting tired 
len ratingone  Beyond the privacy issues inherent in the present day google gone evil sensitive personal data collector chrome this browser suffers from script kiddie pop up problems that can t be fixed 
len ratingone Malignant websites or scripts even on first level links from sites operated by google like google news present modal non dismissible pop up dialogs with just an OK button 
len ratingone Of course click ok and you re pwned 
len ratingone Unlike on safari there s no way to get around it other than to delete the browser app and all its data because you can t clear data or caches without interacting with that pop up first and force closing the app has no effect on the problem 
len ratingone So deleting is the only solution 
len ratingone This is what I ve done and what I recommend everyone else do 
len ratingone Bye google 
len ratingone Worst experience ever 
len ratingone When I got to my destination my hotel was canceled 
len ratingone I ended up having to sleep at the airport on the chairs 
len ratingone I would never recommend Booking com to anyone 
len ratingtwo I can t look at any page without it crashing 
len ratingtwo Used to love chrome but no more 
len ratingtwo Time to find a better browser 
len ratingtwo  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingtwo If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingfive Google is great and it does everything for you it s better than any other browser
len ratingone I ve had to remove and reinstall this app more than times now because visiting any site as simple WALMART or WAYFAIR means I get a suspicious prompt to OK some stupid Amazon offer which is an obvious attempt at installing spyware on my phone 
len ratingone That does not happen with Safari 
len ratingone CLEAN UP YOUR APP 
len ratingone The update messed it up I can t save images and it keeps exiting me out of the app and it s so slow
len ratingone The ability to swipe rt and lt to get to bookmarks and recent history isn t available now this is a down date not an update 
len ratingone The recent update has removed the ability to view your bookmarks in alphabetical order 
len ratingone I m completely lost now trying to find my bookmarks when I need to 
len ratingone They are randomly ordered now hence the one star review 
len ratingone Put our bookmarks back in alphabetical order and you get five stars 
len ratingone Yes it s that big of a deal 
len ratingone For months this browser is hijacked by a sweepstakes redirect 
len ratingone No other browser is affected 
len ratingone Maybe there is an IT Dept at google I don t know
len ratingthree This past month the chrome on my iPad Pro has been taken over by fake pop ups that link to malware and freeze the browser unless you click their link 
len ratingthree I ve deleted and reinstalled the app several times a day to eliminate it and I just can t keep doing that 
len ratingthree Chrome works fine on all my other devices but I ve cleared away my history cookies cache and everything and reset it from my PC but it won t fix the iOS on my iPad 
len ratingthree Until I kept getting all of those congratulations pop ups that you can t click out of 
len ratingthree The only way I could get out of it was to delete the app entirely which I did over times in a day 
len ratingthree There is no way to block the pop ups and I would like a fix to get rid of the pop up scams 
len ratingtwo Why can t I change the search engine to other than the few pretty installed ones 
len ratingone Won t let you use a different google account than the one it s already using
len ratingfive Been an iOS Chrome user for Soooooo long 
len ratingfive I was getting really frustrated that I couldn t long press to save images but this seems to have been corrected with the last update 
len ratingfive Came here to give one star but you ve redeemed yourselves 
len ratingfive Congratulations 
len ratingone Saying you block pop ups isn t the same as actually blocking pop ups 
len ratingone This browser is downright dangerous when it allows malicious phishing ads that can t be closed without clicking the ad 
len ratingone Uninstalling 
len ratingone Pop ups even though my settings have them turned off 
len ratingone This had got to be the worse google creation to date would not recommend anyone even try this 
len ratingtwo Bookmarks are much more difficult to access 
len ratingtwo You have to sift through all of them instead of having the files in a neat list 
len ratingtwo Aggravating 
len ratingtwo Autofill doesn t work properly 
len ratingtwo The information still fills in but the sites don t see it making me have to re type the information all over again defeating the purpose of autofill 
len ratingtwo Why fix it if it ain t broke 
len ratingtwo C mon Google you re better than this 
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingone I ve been using Chrome on my iPad Air for a while 
len ratingone At first the app worked just fine 
len ratingone But over the time I don t know if it s just me but it has become unbearable to use 
len ratingone It crashes so often lags web pages randomly go blank making me have to refresh them again 
len ratingone I ve sent reports to address these issues for these past weeks nothing has been done 
len ratingone I m sick of using Chrome I will be deleting this app and will find a new browser to use 
len ratingtwo I ve used Chrome on iPhone for years 
len ratingtwo Recently the new headlines feature makes it difficult to use 
len ratingtwo I open a new tab and start typing the search that I want 
len ratingtwo In the middle of typing the keyboard disappears on me and I hit a headline and go to some news story instead of what I wanted to search for 
len ratingtwo It doesn t give you any feedback on how long you need to wait before it is stable and ready for you to start typing and I haven t found a way to disable this feature 
len ratingtwo Until Google fixes the disappearing keyboard problem I ll be using Firefox 
len ratingtwo Although the flower came on time it was much smaller than I expected 
len ratingtwo It was proportionally blown out in the picture 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingone Hitting download on iPad does nothing and stays on the App Store screen 
len ratingone I tap fifty times but no progress circle shows up 
len ratingone Srly however made this app literally needs to update it to make all websites available all of my favorite websites are removed for no reason 
len ratingone You need to make it like Firefox or Safari were it allows all websites but in till you let all websites available you are having a bad review for me
len ratingone Google UI UX team please fix your placement of the VIEW SAVED button when scrolling through images on google search 
len ratingone I always click the view saved button almost one out of three times while swiping up to scroll through images 
len ratingone It s so annoying and I ll probably stop using chrome until this gets fixed 
len ratingfour Some may hate the bookmark bar but some love it 
len ratingfour Please give us the option 
len ratingone I just updated the new version last night Chrome crashed times right after the updating 
len ratingone It even automatic turned off iOS looks like the whole system crashed 
len ratingone I had to reboot the iOS system manually several times it never happened to me before the updating 
len ratingone The Chrome is running almost times slower than before 
len ratingone The last Crash erased all of my existing tabs and couldn t reboot them anymore 
len ratingone Google headquarters please replace the new Chrome Design team they are making worse of the Chrome which used to be one of the best Web surfing app 
len ratingtwo Google Chrome used to be my go to app but with recent updates I ve been using Safari and Opera 
len ratingtwo It s super annoying when I go to type something into the navigation bar and then it erases everything I just typed and takes me back to the most recent news stories 
len ratingtwo I m also not really interested in the news articles appearing there as they do 
len ratingtwo Maybe make it optional 
len ratingtwo The last complaint is webpages not loading completely 
len ratingtwo It s kind of hard to read an article when I scroll down for the rest of the article and all I can see is white no text 
len ratingtwo These are my three main concerns with this app 
len ratingtwo Other than that it s a good one 
len ratingthree  it contnually provides no way to escape from or shut down app blocking pop ups 
len ratingfive This app google chrome is one of the best apps I think I have ever had because it it like a big brain 
len ratingfive I know it sounds a little crazy but it s true it knows EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD 
len ratingfive You can search anything and whatever you searched up will have a lot of cool facts websites etc 
len ratingfive etc 
len ratingfive so buy google chrome it s the BEST 
len ratingone I don t want to see the suggested content whenever I open a browser 
len ratingone There s no option to turn that off 
len ratingone I found this new feature offensive and condescending 
len ratingone Seriously google what happened your clean landing page philosophy 
len ratingone I hope this thing goes away or at least can be turned off in the next update 
len ratingfive I encountered a warm customer experience with a speedy getting and informative introduction about the store s general operations 
len ratingfive Nick was a great help in helping us select a suitable bedroom set 
len ratingfive Thanks Home Zone 
len ratingone Can t save enlarge or copy images anymore 
len ratingone I am unable to use Shutterfly since the new update 
len ratingfive  safari 
len ratingfive Awesome and great
len ratingone SEE THE TITLE
len ratingone When your browsing in landscape it does not utilize the full screen on the iPhone X and the search tool bar gets in the way when browsing using landscape I How this issue can be resolved and the app often closes
len ratingone I don t know what s taking so long 
len ratingone If no one likes how they can t view a picture full image then FIX IT 
len ratingone VISIT SHARE and SAVE is what everyone sees when clicking on a NON FULL IMAGE when WANTING to view A FULL IMAGE 
len ratingone I m pretty sure people that work at google see that stupid bull crap change it back to normal 
len ratingone Really frustrating that I have to copy and paste the url into safari to save an image 
len ratingone C mon
len ratingone Slow and doesn t load garbage bruh
len ratingone I use Chrome on my laptop and it s my preferred browser on my phone but the recent changes to image search are terrible 
len ratingone I don t want to visit share or save the image I just want to see a larger version without having to open a new tab 
len ratingone Change it back it s not an improvement 
len ratingone I do not like the new updated version as it s harder to get to my bookmarks now seems like a step back 
len ratingone Can you please go back to the older version or somehow tell me how to get my bookmarks back 
len ratingone I m crying Half of its GONE and they are very important to me 
len ratingone Now I don t know where to look for them 
len ratingone Can someone help me please 
len ratingone There s nothing wrong with the older version nothing like this
len ratingfour  iOS logo 
len ratingfive So asome 
len ratingfive Google is great 
len ratingfive  years old 
len ratingone Chrome needs performance improvement
len ratingtwo A rinky dink UX designer would be raked over the coals for burying the single most important element of a browser s end user experience this being bookmarks underneath a separate submenu 
len ratingtwo Yet Google with its most recent update did just that 
len ratingtwo It s absolutely bewildering 
len ratingtwo This along with their mobile browser s anemic customization settings make this a barebones in all the wrong way experience 
len ratingtwo A browser s bookmarks needs to be easily and readily accessible 
len ratingtwo An open tab should be forced to hold a browser s history 
len ratingtwo A browser even a mobile one should have some basic level customization and QoL options 
len ratingtwo This is no longer a new browser 
len ratingtwo It s Chrome from Google 
len ratingtwo They can do better and we the user deserve better than this 
len ratingone I used to LOVE chrome 
len ratingone Seems every update it gets more bloated and they add disruptive and obnoxious ads to the experience 
len ratingone I HATE the new direction and will be switching browsers 
len ratingfour Great alternative to safari
len ratingone Say I want to look for a nearby restaurant 
len ratingone This app consistently can t figure out where I am while Google Maps is spot on 
len ratingone Say I want to save a picture 
len ratingone Many times I cannot while Safari does this flawlessly 
len ratingone I hate the new feature of having suggested new content 
len ratingone It says to swipe up to get there 
len ratingone However when I type in the top part to search or go to a website it refreshes itself and scrolls down to the content 
len ratingone This forces me to either start over with typing my search or to accidentally click on a website I do not want to go to 
len ratingone Fix this feature soon please or I will use another browser 
len ratingone It takes longer to go to the content I want to see because of this added feature 
len ratingfive Easy and convenient to use 
len ratingthree It was kind of odd to find my bookmarks at first
len ratingfour  I have an iPhone SE an iPad mini both running the current version of iOS 
len ratingfour I use multiple computers Mac Windows Linux appreciate that information syncs between all the devices 
len ratingfour The only issues I have is that Chrome seems to freeze when trying select items from the menu that it does not seem possible to cast videos from Chrome casting works from other apps on my devices so I do not believe this is a device limit or a configuration issue 
len ratingfive  LIKE THE SIMPLE PAGE WITHOUT TOO MANY ADS
len ratingfive  chrome wegame chrome 
len ratingfive  hhhhhhh
len ratingone My phone crashes of the time I use this app on my phone 
len ratingone It completely shuts my phone down 
len ratingone Moving on to Safari 
len ratingthree You new upgrade messed up the bookmarks 
len ratingthree You now have to go thru several windows to get to what you want 
len ratingthree Upgrade may be fine for those that don t use a lot of bookmarks with folders and subfolders but those that do they are much worse than they were before upgrade 
len ratingone The new version want to make me go back to fire fox 
len ratingone Horrible update 
len ratingone How do I get the old one back 
len ratingone No way to turn off the suggested content list on the new tab page which uses data unnecessarily and causes a glitch as it loads in the middle of a search 
len ratingone With the addition of it being slower than safari due to apple imposed limitations I will not continue to use this app if I have to see extra ads every time I use it 
len ratingone Chrome is still my preferred browser on desktop 
len ratingone Let s hope the bonehead developers of this app don t get their hands on that 
len ratingone  New tabs no longer open the google search page 
len ratingone You cannot change your homepage for new tabs even to google com 
len ratingone If you want to get to google you have to type it in the url bar 
len ratingone Instead of your normal search box on a new tab tapping on the search box on a new tab makes it disappear replacing the space it occupied with articles Chrome wants you to read 
len ratingone You have no direct control of this content 
len ratingone The clean google page you re used to is slowly turning into MSN 
len ratingone By this time next year I fully expect clickbait style links on new chrome tabs 
len ratingone Entire folders of my bookmarks appear to be missing 
len ratingone Also folders and subfolders are buried and impossible to find
len ratingone Chrome has been my favorite browser on the iPad until now 
len ratingone Until the most recent update I had a lovely list of bookmarks that displayed every time I opened Chrome 
len ratingone It meant I never forgot those links they were alway easily accessible 
len ratingone Now I have to go through the whole process of clicking on bookmarks then mobile to see my bookmarks 
len ratingone It may seem a minor inconvenience but it also means those bookmarks are mostly likely going to become out of sight out of mind Please at least allow the user the option of changing the new tab page so it displays the bookmarks 
len ratingone I don t really want or need the news feed content or the redundant search box 
len ratingthree Until the last update this app was great 
len ratingthree But after the last updates I keep getting congratulations you ve been selected pop ups that freeze the browser unless I click the link 
len ratingthree The only way to fix is to delete and reinstall the app 
len ratingthree And I DO have the block pop ups turned on 
len ratingthree This has happened x today 
len ratingthree Uninstalled until addressed 
len ratingone It tells me there is no internet when I connect with cellular 
len ratingone Is this thing wifi only 
len ratingone Going back to Safari 
len ratingone  Since the new update all of my bookmarks are now completely out of order 
len ratingone I have to many to sit and try to put them back in alphabetical order 
len ratingone Please update the app to where all of my bookmarks are set to automatically be placed in alphabetical order 
len ratingone Stupid me I loaded this app thinking that of course Chrome would have chromecasting as a feature but it s not to be 
len ratingone How can Chrome not have Chromecast as an option when browsing 
len ratingone I hate this update 
len ratingone Lost the way bookmarks were shown on new tab 
len ratingone Now its recent thumbnails only 
len ratingone Do not like 
len ratingthree At first I thought they were broken but then I found everything either way I hate the change
len ratingone It is absolutely bad design that to turn off these stupid articles you have to turn autofill off 
len ratingone I have no desire to see news 
len ratingone Especially curated articles 
len ratingone If I want news I will find it myself 
len ratingone Complete garbage and worthless app now 
len ratingone Bookmarks are gone and I have to click more times just to go to another site I bookmarked 
len ratingone Also now I m forced to read news articles when I click a new tab 
len ratingone Leaving Chrome until you fix this 
len ratingone Completely unacceptable 
len ratingone Only opens or tabs then freezes Forcing me to reboot 
len ratingone Been happening for plus months I will now use Safari or Firefox
len ratingone  This has been a very good app until today 
len ratingone Before today when I downloaded the new update my bookmarks no longer opens on an entire web page with folders and everything 
len ratingone Now they re all munged together and I LOATHE it 
len ratingone Please change it back to the way it was before I downloaded the new update please 
len ratingone Where s your testers google 
len ratingone This is yet another update that made it out that does more damage than good 
len ratingone Can you please get some testers that have even a clue 
len ratingone Even is better than the none you currently use 
len ratingone In images you used to be able to tap the image and not see where it was from and show just the image 
len ratingone That was removed 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingthree I used to share articles constantly from the chrome browser using the up arrow in settings to pull up sharing options 
len ratingthree But that feature hasn t worked on any of my devices iPhone iPad Mini iPad Air after updating to iOS for at least a over a week now and I m having to cut and paste links instead 
len ratingone Somehow they took the best browser I ve used and ruined it 
len ratingone Why did you mess with the bookmark setup like that 
len ratingone IT MAKES NO SENSE 
len ratingone This new system makes bookmarks practically useless 
len ratingone Being able to reorder bookmarks is great but being able to access bookmark easily is essential 
len ratingone Please for the love of all that s good FIX THIS 
len ratingone  or at the very least call this patch a loss and just put it back the way it was 
len ratingone  crash on ipad pro ios so sad 
len ratingtwo The last update removed bookmarks from the new tab page 
len ratingtwo Now you have taps to do something that used to take 
len ratingtwo The new tab page is now useless and just make thing harder to use 
len ratingone not updated for iphone x
len ratingone The fact that I am forced to turn off search suggestions as the only way to get rid of the constant barrage of pointless news articles every time I open a new tab is ridiculous 
len ratingone I ve used Chrome on my phones for as long as I can remember especially since it synchs with my computers but as much as I dislike Safari I much rather use that than deal with this nonsense 
len ratingtwo  Google yet again insists on fixing things in Chrome that don t need fixing 
len ratingtwo The browser s latest December release now places bookmarks in a hard to access link in the upper right corner of the browser instead of as before where you could open up a new tab and have all your bookmarks clearly laid out in front of you 
len ratingtwo What once took one tap now takes at least three and viewing and navigating are more cumbersome than ever 
len ratingtwo Changing a user interface just to pretend you are making it better is a sure sign of a company without a clue desperate to show that they on top of things 
len ratingtwo Heaven knows what havoc they are letting there developers and programmers wreak on other Google offerings but if Chrome is any indication things are not looking good 
len ratingtwo Making an app less intuitive less easy to use is not the way to go and it is inexcusable for Google to not know this 
len ratingtwo The days of Do no evil are long gone at Google 
len ratingtwo  Do no stupid is the most we can hope for now and unfortunately this latest misguided improvement to Chrome shows no one is paying attention to that idea either anymore 
len ratingthree Had Chrome since Day on my s whenever that version first came out 
len ratingthree It even performed wonderfully throughout all the Apple update snafus 
len ratingthree Yesterday the icon totally disappeared and I can t get it back no matter what I try 
len ratingthree I can t even open the app within the App Store which says I still have Chrome installed 
len ratingthree I m about to totally lose it because in my job I depend on Chrome a lot and if I can t access it then I end up the proverbial creek really quickly 
len ratingthree Sorry Google and or Apple 
len ratingthree I m rapidly losing faith here 
len ratingtwo  Chrome needs to have similar buttons to safari which are at the button 
len ratingtwo That s the only way I would use this 
len ratingtwo I do use chrome on windows every day 
len ratingtwo With those buttons at the bottom I would definitely prefer chrome 
len ratingtwo Safari won t let you create folders when adding a bookmark 
len ratingtwo Too bad iOS doesn t have a back button and a menu button like android 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingthree Google had twice the amount of MB 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingtwo When I now try to find images I can no longer click on the picture to go into fullscreen instead it gives me the option to visit share and save when I wish to not do any of those options 
len ratingtwo Why have you taken this away 
len ratingthree the app used to be amazing but now it s acting up 
len ratingthree the app keeps crashing when i try to look something up really quick 
len ratingthree and when i search a picture i used to be able to click on it to make the search bar and info go away 
len ratingthree but now it doesn t work 
len ratingfive  sst 
len ratingone Chrome is my go to both on my phone and pc so naturally I had to have to for my new iPad 
len ratingone Boy was that a mistake 
len ratingone  separate times downloaded with the same results 
len ratingone I put in the web address I desire a math tutoring site for my child 
len ratingone I am taken to that site and within second pop up malware ads that cannot be deleted hijack the screen 
len ratingone Chrome locks up completely and on two occasions I had to restart my iPad 
len ratingone This is unacceptable 
len ratingone Please make the much needed security changes or at the very least patch the holes in your chrome app 
len ratingone Now google is trying to make it more difficult to access bookmarks in chrome 
len ratingone All part of an agenda to drive people to controlled social media 
len ratingone So no force zoom 
len ratingone What is it with these amateur developers who think accessibility stops where mobile starts 
len ratingone Who at Google decided that people with low and poor vision don t matter 
len ratingone Apple saw that these amateurs were ruining it and put forced zoom in iOS and Google removes it in their browser 
len ratingone Hire professionals 
len ratingone Does not add subject line when sending articles through gmail 
len ratingone Why can t we long press images to save them anymore 
len ratingone Or save them at all if they re on their own tab 
len ratingone Slight fix for anyone else having this issue copy link URL paste into Safari save image like a normal browser should Hi this issue should have been fixed in the latest release 
len ratingone Please let us know if you still can t save the image 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive  VPN 
len ratingone Rubbish app for iPad 
len ratingone Bookmark cannot be synced while It works on iPhone 
len ratingone Stupid idea to make bookmark menu so confusing and unfriendly 
len ratingone Really Google 
len ratingfive It s not slow and is much more useful than google
len ratingfive So good to watch xvideos it s sooo cool 
len ratingone This is a bogus charge I live in Georgia in USA please take time to find out what is wrong 
len ratingthree If I went into image search an update or two ago I could tap on the image to get everything else like the white empty space and search bar and description text to go away 
len ratingthree Now when I press on an image I see Visit Share and Save 
len ratingthree Which is pointless because you can already do those things by pressing other buttons 
len ratingthree So What am I missing 
len ratingthree Please explain why I can t just poof everything away after selecting an image and tapping 
len ratingone I can t save images anymore 
len ratingone That s a pretty important feature and it s endlessly frustrating that I can no longer save images 
len ratingfive Hey 
len ratingfive Can someone or anyone even app developers tell me if this app can do the following Searching google by uploading a photo 
len ratingfive A photo uploaded from my iPhone 
len ratingfive Please get back to me ASAP 
len ratingfive THANK YOU
len ratingfive Thank you for making the best browser ever 
len ratingfive However I have a simple feature request Can you make the Chrome app compatible with the iPad Pro keyboard 
len ratingfive I really miss keyboard shortcuts specially CTRL TAB to navigate between opened tabs 
len ratingfive Cheers 
len ratingfive  I love it
len ratingfour I just updated Chrome and it crashed 
len ratingfour After it crashed I exited out of the app then tried to open it again 
len ratingfour It doesnt open but shows the app shaded like when you press an app to open it and stays like that until I press it again and it turns back to normal but doesnt open We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingfour If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingfive It s nice
len ratingfive The new update caused Chrome unable to save image anymore on iOS 
len ratingfive Please fix this promptly 
len ratingfive Update Have updated the app with the latest version for a couple of days now December 
len ratingfive And the saving image feature after long press have return 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive I hope this feature will never be disabled again 
len ratingfive  Hi we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingfive Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingthree iPhone X Works quite well in portrait made but there is a blank bar at the top of the screen while viewing websites in landscape mode 
len ratingthree I understand the area for the notch in portrait mode but for the area to remain in landscape mode is a waste of screen space 
len ratingthree The website should fill the screen from top to bottom in landscape mode like it does with Safari 
len ratingthree Hopefully they fix this soon 
len ratingone Auto fill does not work correctly with the most current version example pop up login requirements 
len ratingone This was my favorite feature when using Chrome please look into this error 
len ratingone Slow as a snail 
len ratingone When I turn my phone sideways to look at a image it doesn t go to fullscreen and I m not sure if it s my phone or just a bug but if I can get it fixed then I m just going back to safari
len ratingthree  Whenever I start typing a search term in either the search box on Google com or in the URL box I type maybe the first or letters and it disappears on me 
len ratingthree And I have to retype it all over again 
len ratingthree Can you please fix this 
len ratingthree  iPad Pro 
len ratingfive Yeah buddy 
len ratingfive My number is 
len ratingfive Just le me Know
len ratingfive  PC Google 
len ratingone There is a really nasty pop up that keeps showing up whenever I use google chrome on my iPhone 
len ratingone I ve tried on several occasions to redownload clear history and data which wipes things out for my laptop and it still shows up 
len ratingone It doesn t matter what type of site I m on it shows up 
len ratingone Cooking websites social media google searches reading articles 
len ratingone It s really aggravating 
len ratingone Until a solution can be explained this will remain a one star for me 
len ratingone I m not a big fan of safari because I use google chrome for all my devices 
len ratingone But now it s just a placeholder til I can figure out this issue 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingone Send help 
len ratingone Bookmarks on new tab are gone 
len ratingone Not functional at all when I have to click times for each bookmark 
len ratingone Looking for a new browser 
len ratingtwo In the previous version a new tab would display a sorted listing of my bookmarks 
len ratingtwo Now I need to click on the bottom of the new tab page and get an unsorted listing of my bookmarks 
len ratingtwo Terrible 
len ratingone On older versions when you would open a new tab you could see you bookmarks 
len ratingone Fantastic 
len ratingone On the new version when you open a new tab you see previous sites you visited and popular sites 
len ratingone If you don t want to see those you can remove them 
len ratingone Great 
len ratingone Until that is you open a new tab and guess what you see again 
len ratingone Now you have to dig to find you bookmarks and have no way to change the new tab page 
len ratingtwo I ve been a longtime Chrome user on multiple iPhones throughout the years and overall it has been decent until now 
len ratingtwo Even after all this time and multiple updates since the iPhone X was released Chrome is still practically unusable on Apple s new flagship device in landscape mode 
len ratingtwo In landscape mode it zooms in the page and won t let you zoom out to see the whole webpage seems this varies depending on the site 
len ratingtwo Another glaring issue is that you can t tap the top of the screen to instantly scroll to the top of the current page in landscape mode 
len ratingtwo I ve sent constructive feedback a few times already and never gotten a reply or even acknowledgement of them receiving it 
len ratingtwo Guess the team at google just don t plan on fixing this glaring issue 
len ratingtwo iPHONE X USERS AVOID 
len ratingthree The one thing that is keeping me away from Chrome is the unavailability of the Read View mode that has been available eons ago on Safari and Firefox 
len ratingthree Google must know that this is a deal breaker for a lot of users 
len ratingfive Patrick has once again has gone beyond to make yet another new car purchase 
len ratingfive His knowledge about my new car Elantra have succeeded my expectations once again 
len ratingfive I have been with Patrick since my first new car since 
len ratingfive He is a big asset to Rick Case and my experiences have proved him to be 
len ratingfive Kudos to Patrick Reece for being a spokesman and valuable Salesman for your dealership 
len ratingfive Anyone I know who wants to purchase a Hyundai will be introduced by me to Patrick 
len ratingfive Thank you for another great experience 
len ratingfive Ron MacLellan 
len ratingone I have iOS 
len ratingone I just updated the Chrome app and now all it does is bring up the chrome splash screen then quits after about seconds 
len ratingone PLEASE FIX 
len ratingone Obviously a bad update 
len ratingone  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingfour Chrome is great I would use it instead of safari if only it had a bookmark bar
len ratingthree I don t like this update
len ratingone Please make a option to disable the new tab news feed 
len ratingthree Google s decision to tie auto completion to suggested websites means I ll no longer be using this app 
len ratingthree Safari is adequate and there are plenty of other options 
len ratingone Immediately deleted 
len ratingone  Hi there did you see the save image option when you long press on the image you try to save 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingthree Apps still don t populate links in Chrome
len ratingthree This new update prevents me from using the Share button 
len ratingthree Please fix it 
len ratingtwo If you have updated it is too late to go back 
len ratingtwo The new interface is very difficult to use on my iPad 
len ratingtwo My links are still there 
len ratingtwo But what were you thinking 
len ratingone What the heck where they thinking with the bookmarks update anyways 
len ratingone Gotta wonder if anyone actually QA tests this stuff at all Im guessing no aaaaand now they ve made it worse
len ratingone Given Google and other Alphabet subsidiaries recent expressed views and discriminatory punitive treatment of content creators and employees who dared to embrace wrongthink by Alphabet s definition Chrome suggesting web content is a terrifying proposition and more than sufficient reason to avoid all such Chrome versions at all costs 
len ratingone The only thing that stops me from using Google Chrome fully is not being able to reorganize my tabs I have open 
len ratingone I can t view my bookmarks on open tabs now 
len ratingone I used to click on a bookmark read the site close the site and be back at my bookmarks where I d rinse and repeat with the next bookmark in my list 
len ratingone UPDATE Still issues 
len ratingone Now the bookmarks don t show unless I go hunting for them in a menu 
len ratingone So now they are still gone from the old bookmark grid page style AND NOW I have to actually LOOK for them 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Browser is slow typing lags horribly bookmarks icons disappear when scrolling down the screen 
len ratingone Chrome for iPad keeps forgetting my passwords 
len ratingone Please let us have the old bookmark method back where we would have larger square icons that did not disappear when I scroll down the screen AND they sorted themselves horizontally across the screen from left to right 
len ratingone I remove the titles on all of my bookmarks to be able to fit more on my desktop Chrome browser 
len ratingone The list view of small icons is really poor design 
len ratingone I used to rave about how wonderful this browser was but back in March it seems to have taken a turn for the worse 
len ratingone Mine worked fine until the new operating system from Apple came to fix other crashes and now this is crashing 
len ratingone Make be chrome needs an update to the update 
len ratingone Doesn t even have an option to cast with chromecast 
len ratingone Bookmarks are also a headache to imports Downloaded and immediately deleted 
len ratingone Why would we have google chrome with ios when safari is so much better 
len ratingone At least if you could use your chromecast 
len ratingfive  qaq
len ratingtwo After reading other reviews I m glad I m not the only one who feels this way 
len ratingtwo I love the iOS version of Chrome 
len ratingtwo I ve used it since day since I got an iphone so for about years 
len ratingtwo It s a great browser but I truly miss the feature of saving an image that s alone on its own page 
len ratingtwo I didn t think I would miss it as much but I love Google image searching an image for the highest quality clicking and opening an image then saving it 
len ratingtwo But sadly now I can t 
len ratingtwo I didn t think this would be a deal breaker for me but I m not so sure anymore 
len ratingtwo I hope this feature comes back 
len ratingtwo Otherwise I might have to use another browser to search my nice high quality wallpapers 
len ratingtwo It s not a big deal but it is annoying and a hassle not being able to do it all within one browser now 
len ratingone This hasn t happened in a while so I thought it was a problem anymore but I just lost all of my tabs AGAIN 
len ratingone Please fix this INCREDIBLE ANNOYING ISSUE 
len ratingone When using the search box I will start typing chrome will then randomly refresh in the middle of typing and erase any text that was there 
len ratingone Does not appear to keep happening within session just when the Chrome app is opened for the first time 
len ratingone This does not seem to be an isolated case as other users have mentioned this 
len ratingone Not this update nor the past several though every other Google app does 
len ratingone Ridiculous 
len ratingone There needs to be a way to turn those off 
len ratingone Oh right use another browser 
len ratingone The app crashes like once or twice every week and most times it doesn t even give me the option to restore tabs and I lose EVERYTHING
len ratingone So in order to get search suggestions I m forced to see a bunch stupid news stories on the bottom of the app if I turn the news feed off search suggestions are disabled also WHY 
len ratingone Now that Chrome fills the bottom of the page with fake clickbait news they are Yahoo and deleted 
len ratingthree  This iOS version of Chrome was once the perfect browser but recent updates have removed one simple thing that I until now had taken for granted the Save Image feature 
len ratingthree By that I don t mean that one can no longer save an image you can What I m referring to was the ability to save from an image only tab not sure if there s an actual name for them and save it in its highest quality 
len ratingthree Now the best I can do is save the thumbnail images from the link that leads to the new tab but these are of such poor quality as they are not intended to be saved 
len ratingthree If there is any image I want to save in its highest quality I m resorting to other apps to accomplish this 
len ratingthree This may sound like a back handed compliment but the reason I still use Chrome as my go to browser is because I see no flaws within it aside from the issue mentioned above and it s worth the hassle 
len ratingthree I do hope that the option to save an image from its own tab by pressing and holding isn t gone for good because it s the last piece to the puzzle of a flawless iPhone browser in my subjective opinion 
len ratingone Suddenly the save picture was gone even if the tab only contains a picture url i guess am back to safari 
len ratingthree So far from what I ve used it it s better in every aspect than safari 
len ratingthree BUT recently my app has developed a glitch where every other thing I search will get cleared making it very annoying to use it 
len ratingone  Where is the cancel button after accidentally refreshing the page 
len ratingone  how can you rearrange the tabs 
len ratingone  why is the address bar on very top of big phone 
len ratingone  why is it so hard to get to the bookmarks when you re not on the homepage whynot take advantage of the force touch Safari is so much better than chrome for mobile 
len ratingone Much more user friendly
len ratingtwo It seems that I cannot save images to my camera roll 
len ratingtwo Frustrating 
len ratingfive hi
len ratingtwo It crashes if you don t scroll the article after a few seconds 
len ratingtwo This is on a day old iPhone X so I doubt it s the phone 
len ratingfive Never any issues
len ratingtwo Update Chrome is not supporting display on Iphone X App leaves a huge area as white screen at top in landscape mode and has jittery scrolling that randomly jumps around on some pages 
len ratingtwo Please fix my favorite browser 
len ratingtwo Great browser Uses full screen and lets me share links with desktop chrome 
len ratingone Can t read anything for more than minutes without the Aw Snap popping up and having to reload the page 
len ratingone Works on my laptop so I know it s the app 
len ratingone I ve tried all your suggestions and it doesn t work 
len ratingone Can t use chrome until this is fixed
len ratingfour Will not update
len ratingone Stop pushing articles on my new tab page 
len ratingone Not opening links 
len ratingthree Recently news articles have shown up and the only way to remove them that I can see is to disable the search and suggest option which also disables search suggests which is nice to have 
len ratingthree Very annoying 
len ratingthree So much that I deleted the app 
len ratingone  Google Speech to text foes not work with this version of chrome 
len ratingone Another issue I have is the main homepage to google Chrome opens contains news which I do not want 
len ratingone Please eliminate the news on the home screen 
len ratingfive  ssl 
len ratingone It is such a pain not being able to save or copy images anymore 
len ratingone What the f 
len ratingone If i want to save an image from a tab that only contains an image I have to copy the link and paste it into Firefox or Safari and the reason I use Chrome is so that I don t have to use Firefox or Safari 
len ratingone My permissions are all in line with me being able to save images and having to copy and paste into a different browser or screenshot and crop or even use Google Drive is just such a hassle to have to deal with 
len ratingone Please please PLEASE bring these features back because I am losing my mind 
len ratingone I have no clue what the devs were thinking 
len ratingfive  All I care about is speed 
len ratingfive Chrome is very very fast and is very good 
len ratingfive Best alternate after safari 
len ratingfive thats greate but more updates need
len ratingfour  I d really like the ability to force zoom pages and if I was in incognito it should open links incognito mode and not a regular tab it would be nice if we have the edge swipe to switch tabs back too 
len ratingfour And since we have files maybe a download folder 
len ratingfive Waiting for the app to install
len ratingone I love chrome browser on my PC but unfortunately on my iPad air it s so laggy and has many glitches compare to safari 
len ratingone I know y device is not the newest but still this much glitches for simple scrolling is just so annoying 
len ratingone Since latest update Chrome crashes in two ways on my iPad and iPhone Stalls out 
len ratingone Does nothing after being on a site for a short amt 
len ratingone of time 
len ratingone I cant get it to come back to life 
len ratingone I clear the app and start over and hit restore when opens back up the app then just crashes and it goes away from the screen killing itself 
len ratingone Please fix not up to google standards 
len ratingone If you re already typing in the address bar the suggested stories takes the focus when it finishes loading and resets the url bar forcing you to start over 
len ratingone And turning it off in the chrome ios app means you turn off url suggestions in chrome for windows 
len ratingone That s just silly and should be separate preferences 
len ratingone It s got me switching back to Safari on ios until it s fixed 
len ratingone Please fix this the page is not responding it delays and it keeps crashing 
len ratingone Google photos has been saving pictures from my phone without my permission or me even having the app downloaded on my phone 
len ratingone I feel their practice of automatically adding this feature to my phone and no clear opt out option to be an extreme violation of privacy 
len ratingone I don t want the news I just want a browser 
len ratingone Why does every google product show the news 
len ratingone Im tired of google chrome i wait every time for updates to repair the bugs but it gets worser with every update 
len ratingone We ve lately lost the save image option too 
len ratingone Think I ll go back to safari 
len ratingone Maybe it is just me but I think Google has been getting lazy 
len ratingone In order to save images to my phone I must open the URL in Safari 
len ratingone If I long press on an image that is on a webpage with anything else I can save it or copy it 
len ratingone If I long press on an image that I opened in its own tab nothing 
len ratingone I have a few choices at this point I can give up not gonna happen I can save a low quality image from it s original page no thank you maybe next time or I can start using Safari 
len ratingone I don t want to use Safari but I also don t like using anything that does not work the way it should 
len ratingone I have been loyal to Google for many years but lately it just isn t happening 
len ratingone I m sorry to say but there are better options 
len ratingone You just have to look 
len ratingthree I ve been wishing for the phone version of Chrome to have tab browsing mode like that on an iPad 
len ratingthree I know if phone screen is small but if Dolphin browser for iPhone can have tab mode I figure Chrome should be able to do the same too 
len ratingthree For now I don t want to see myself browsing the web on Chrome for iPhone as switching between tabs is not that intuitive 
len ratingone On my old phone with a previous version of Chrome if you were to search an image and open the original image blank page with only the image AKA direct links you were able to long press the image and an option would pop up to copy or save 
len ratingone It no longer does that I recently installed the up to date version on my new phone 
len ratingone Nothing shows up 
len ratingone I am using the most recent iOS on an iPhone 
len ratingone I ve tried everything 
len ratingone Another fellow downloader also wrote about this on this very page 
len ratingone It seems Google has yet to address this bug completely as it s been weeks since the last update and the the original complaint was filed almost a month ago 
len ratingone This issue has become a real issue as you can no longer download original images and you have to deal with those crappy compressed ones 
len ratingone It s has been very infuriating and should be resolved ASAP 
len ratingone If Google does not properly resolve this issue I unfortunately will refuse to use this browser again and most definitely would not recommend it to my friends especially ones who are image quality savvy 
len ratingone Some websites won t even let you obtain an image unless you get them through a direct link 
len ratingone So don t say It s not a popular feature amongst most users 
len ratingone Chrome has been my go to browser but if issues like this persist that will soon change 
len ratingone This user also has identical issues as I do As stated by user nhlcaptain Update The option to copy images is still completely gone and the save option was not fixed 
len ratingone I was glad to see that a case was filed for this bug 
len ratingone However the case was closed on Oct 
len ratingone It s Nov 
len ratingone The case updates acknowledged that it is now impossible to save or copy when you long press on a page that only contains an image 
len ratingone The staff said perhaps this isn t a popular feature anyway and later pronounced the case resolved 
len ratingone The bug was not fixed despite being acknowledged 
len ratingone I waited to update my review because I thought perhaps resolved would meant an update was forthcoming 
len ratingone I do use save and copy and hope this feature won t be removed on my MacBook as well After one of the recent updates l Can no longer save an image if I open it in a new tab and I can no longer copy any images 
len ratingone Yes I have permissions set to allow Chrome to save photos Settings Privacy Photos Chrome Allow Photo Access Read and Write 
len ratingone I also granted Chrome Camera access 
len ratingone If open the same image via url in Safari and press on it I get the option to save or copy the image 
len ratingone As of one of the last updates Chrome does nothing if I press on an image opened in a new tab the option to save or copy no longer appears 
len ratingone If the image is opened within a page ie Google image search Chrome then gives me the option of saving but the option to simply copy the image is gone 
len ratingone  A Yes that s correct cannot download or copy if there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingone  I look forward to seeing this issue fixed 
len ratingone Sincerely yours VERY ANGRY Google User
len ratingfour Chrome her pretty childface smooth as steel with eyes that would have been at home on the bottom of some deep Atlantic trench cold grey eyes that lived under terrible pressure 
len ratingfour They said she cooked her own cancers for people who crossed her rococo custom variations that took years to kill you 
len ratingfour They said a lot of things about Chrome none of them at all reassuring 
len ratingtwo In landscape mode on iPhone X there is a persistent grey bar at the top that takes up maybe of the whole screen 
len ratingtwo It s been at least a month 
len ratingtwo I switched back to Safari and haven t looked back 
len ratingtwo Crashes a lot 
len ratingtwo Why does the Amazon desktop page for fire tablet crash the browser again and again 
len ratingtwo Lots all my tags when it suits 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingtwo Only I really wanted to keep them 
len ratingtwo Pages load then stop 
len ratingtwo Can t copy images 
len ratingtwo I want to copy and paste 
len ratingtwo Need far more user control 
len ratingtwo How about making a serious browser with full use control and not this crashy child s toy 
len ratingone The app isn t doing anything for me
len ratingone Opening a new tab now loads news articles that I don t care to see and for some reason there s no setting to turn this off 
len ratingone As someone who has supported Google from the early days please focus on building solid products and stay out of politics 
len ratingone HORRIBLE 
len ratingone Don t Do It 
len ratingone I lost ALL MY APPS 
len ratingone NO MORE APPLE FOR THIS GIRL 
len ratingone This is BS 
len ratingtwo Freezes very shortly after I start using on my iPad 
len ratingtwo Worked fine before the last update of Chrome app 
len ratingtwo Please fix as I am tired of using the restore option to try to complete anything 
len ratingtwo The app zapped all my tabs during the update 
len ratingtwo I left them open for a reason 
len ratingtwo The history function doesn t have them so I get to start over 
len ratingthree  flash 
len ratingfour There is still no option to always use incognito mode without having to open an incognito tab manually or D Touch the app icon to launch that way 
len ratingfour Should be just a toggle in the options to allow it to always launch directly into incognito mode 
len ratingthree When i type in address bar keyboard disappears and i have to start all over again 
len ratingthree Iphone s 
len ratingthree Soon to be iphone X
len ratingone Nobody cares about the suggested articles that are all essentially clickbait pure garbage 
len ratingone If we wanted to read that stuff we d search for it 
len ratingone And the fact that it can t be disabled just drives the nail in 
len ratingone Add a way that it can be disabled or just remove it all together 
len ratingthree That is all I get lately 
len ratingthree Was a solid five star app but every update seems to continue their downward spiral 
len ratingfive  vvv 
len ratingone Google intentionally displays liberal information first and blocks out conservative aka factual content 
len ratingone Its largely useless for news or current events unless you want to be a brain dead brainwashed liberal 
len ratingone The big companies especially tech companies are disgusting and unethical 
len ratingone The latest update has done two things that have been really bothering me 
len ratingone The first is clearly a bug 
len ratingone I will open a new tab begin to type what it is I want to search then all of a sudden the search bar completely erases what I had already typed and I must start again 
len ratingone This leads into the second issue 
len ratingone Suggested Articles 
len ratingone I hate them 
len ratingone And apparently I m unable to get suggested search returns without having suggested articles on 
len ratingone So I am typing every letter of every search I wish to make 
len ratingone It feels like time to shop for a new browser 
len ratingone I absolutely HATE the new chrome 
len ratingone I hate the look of it and I hate that you can t get away from all the darn advertisements 
len ratingone I hate the fake news feeds 
len ratingone What happened to the days when you could just open google and start a search get the info you need and done 
len ratingone I don t need or want all the ad tracking 
len ratingone I m officially done with using google as a search engine 
len ratingone  Every other page suddenly blanks out completely in the midst of loading the page and refresh doesn t work so I have to go back and click the link again 
len ratingone This is maddening 
len ratingone No way to turn off news articles when opening new tab 
len ratingone Super intrusive 
len ratingone Just uninstalling 
len ratingthree  Pls update to make the screen display compatible for iPhone X
len ratingthree Tldr Click Menu dots Settings Privacy Search and Site Suggestions to disable suggested news 
len ratingthree I love Google Chrome and have always found its functionality and customizability a step above the rest 
len ratingthree It s sad to me that the recent update requires suggested news if you want suggested searches 
len ratingthree I personally desire LESS news in my life 
len ratingthree Why assume that every user wants to read headlines and use data to load them for every new browser they open 
len ratingthree I now have to use chrome without the ultra helpful suggested searches 
len ratingthree Because they couldn t be separate toggles 
len ratingone  YOU CANT SAVE PICS NOW 
len ratingone F RIGHT OFF AND FIX IT YOU CANTS
len ratingone An excellent browser otherwise but can t seem to be able to block pop ups on certain sites 
len ratingone Has made reading the news impossible 
len ratingone I m not using chrome until they ve resolved this admittedly tiny but VERY irritating problem 
len ratingone  Update The option to copy images is still completely gone and the save option was not fixed 
len ratingone I was glad to see that a case was filed for this bug 
len ratingone However the case was closed on Oct 
len ratingone It s Nov 
len ratingone The case updates acknowledged that it is now impossible to save or copy when you long press on a page that only contains an image 
len ratingone The staff said perhaps this isn t a popular feature anyway and later pronounced the case resolved 
len ratingone The bug was not fixed despite being acknowledged 
len ratingone I waited to update my review because I thought perhaps resolved would meant an update was forthcoming 
len ratingone I do use save and copy and hope this feature won t be removed on my MacBook as well 
len ratingone After one of the recent updates I can no longer save an image if I open it in a new tab and I can no longer copy any images 
len ratingone Yes I have permissions set to allow Chrome to save photos Settings Privacy Photos Chrome Allow Photo Access Read and Write 
len ratingone I also granted Chrome Camera access 
len ratingone If open the same image via url in Safari and press on it I get the option to save or copy the image 
len ratingone As of one of the last updates Chrome does nothing if I press on an image opened in a new tab the option to save or copy no longer appears 
len ratingone If the image is opened within a page ie Google image search Chrome then gives me the option of saving but the option to simply copy the image is gone 
len ratingone  A Yes that s correct cannot download or copy if there s nothing on that page but an image Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingone If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingthree Press and hold does not work anymore even on photos that are not links 
len ratingthree  edited to add Yes press and hold does not bring up the menu even when the photo is the only thing on the page 
len ratingthree Works in safari 
len ratingthree  Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingthree If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree Can t copy images to the clipboard since latest release 
len ratingthree Why 
len ratingthree Replying to Dev If I long press an image it gives me the option to save open the image open in a new tab or search Google for the image 
len ratingthree I want to be able to copy to clipboard 
len ratingthree This was in previous versions and has been removed 
len ratingthree  Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingthree If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone I don t want a news app I downloaded a browser 
len ratingfive  I m
len ratingone Baby that s all we need 
len ratingone I have always liked googles minimalist approach and that s why I use it over aol 
len ratingone Because I m easily distracted 
len ratingone And now my phone the brick of metal and glass that I use to obtain all my knowledge is tainted 
len ratingone When I open my phone to search on chrome who sings that song about a plastic cup I have to get past all of my other notifications and try not to get sidetracked 
len ratingone And now by adding news stories to the new tab tab you have ruined everything 
len ratingone I can t simply search for something 
len ratingone I m now inundated with more news that I don t care about interfering with my quest for knowledge 
len ratingone I ve looked for a toggle to turn if off to no avail 
len ratingone I ve used chrome for awhile but this is too much 
len ratingone I m also upset you got rid of the D Touch copy paste option 
len ratingone That was the only time I ever used D Touch was to open articles I found elsewhere and read them 
len ratingone Please address these issues 
len ratingone Sour in Saskatoon
len ratingone IT IS TERRIBLE 
len ratingone I was hoping chrome would be a faster browser than safari because I like using chrome on the pc 
len ratingone But this app is really terrible 
len ratingone Pages simply don t load 
len ratingone Videos don t play properly 
len ratingone Pages load part way then sit 
len ratingone Total junk from such a great company 
len ratingone There s no way to turn off the annoying suggested sites feature without also disabling search suggestions 
len ratingone This is a pointless user hostile decision 
len ratingone Since the most recent iOS update anything I search opens into a new tab which I have to close out every single individual tab 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone We need the Close All Tabs again this is too time consuming and ridiculous on IPhone and IPad 
len ratingone It should be like it is on the computer where you can clear all history at once including cookies etc and it is not on IOS 
len ratingone Please fix these issues 
len ratingone When a pop up spamming website appears chrome is completely locked and you have to delete the app to use it again 
len ratingthree When a website decides to create an infinite loop of dialogue boxes there needs to be a way to close the tab 
len ratingthree The suppress dialogue feature doesn t work 
len ratingthree Please fix this problem 
len ratingfour  Safari bug 
len ratingone I m legitimately thinking about switching to safari 
len ratingfive When Edge or Explorer browsers fail I can rely on Chrome to open my internet sites consistently 
len ratingfive Especially when I m searching a website to meet a business deadline Chrome has rarely ever let me down Ajile
len ratingthree While I like Google Chrome and it s been reliable lately none of the YouTube videos ever work on the browser 
len ratingthree When trying to watch a video I m forced to switch to a different app since they don t work on this one 
len ratingfive Really good google web browser 
len ratingfive It functions properly but it does lag a little from time to time 
len ratingfive Overall it has a good amount of functionality Bookmarks History obviously etc 
len ratingfive I would recommend this for anyone that hates the Safari standard web browser 
len ratingone  I don t like the news on the new pages 
len ratingone It s annoying they do it on all the websites I don t need it on a new page 
len ratingone Please get rid of it 
len ratingone In i would expect suppress alerts to do just that 
len ratingone I had to delete and reinstall the app 
len ratingthree  safari 
len ratingone So annoyed with ads in chrome 
len ratingone Switching to Safari since it has pretty much caught up to chrome feature wise with what I like and it does a much better job blocking ads which makes the browsing experience much more enjoyable 
len ratingtwo Page automatically reloads periodically and goes completely white 
len ratingtwo Very irritating when you re in the middle of an article 
len ratingfive  xglvghxcgvhfyfgdtg
len ratingtwo There s really no advantage to using Chrome over Firefox or Safari just disadvantages pull page down to refresh needs to have a disable option 
len ratingtwo I can t count how many times I have typed up a post only to scroll up too far and lose what I was typing 
len ratingtwo It s impossible to save images on a direct image page too 
len ratingtwo If it weren t for the fact that I need Chrome for different logins I wouldn t even use it 
len ratingone  several sights render strangely now when zooming in out 
len ratingfive fairy easy to use
len ratingone  UC 
len ratingfive  Great Laptop great price easy to use arrived in great shape 
len ratingfive Thank you joysystems com and Sears 
len ratingfive Thanks Steve Verbena
len ratingfour This is a great browser but Google has made a questionable choice in adding suggested articles to the new tab page 
len ratingfour You can disable this in settings privacy then disable search and site suggestions 
len ratingfour Unfortunately this also disabled predictive search except for items from your history and bookmarks 
len ratingfour Disabling the suggested sites articles and suggested searches should be two separate options 
len ratingfive Why don t add a gesture 
len ratingfive Double tap on the video playing to make it full screen 
len ratingfour I dislike the news feature
len ratingtwo As a browser it works great 
len ratingtwo However whenever I visit any page in another language it pops up and asks to translate it for you 
len ratingtwo No I don t want it to do this right now 
len ratingtwo Yet it asks every page I navigate 
len ratingtwo The only option is never translate X language or never translate for that site 
len ratingtwo However maybe further into the site I do need it 
len ratingtwo What then 
len ratingtwo There is NO OPTION within the settings to REQUEST a page be translated 
len ratingtwo So the only option I m left with is to be subjected constantly by the pop up asking to translate JUST IN CASE I might need it at some point 
len ratingtwo Can we not just have a translate this page option 
len ratingtwo Is that so much to ask 
len ratingtwo I mean really this is ridiculous 
len ratingone Now that Chrome is forcing its choice of news content on new tabs using the app is annoying 
len ratingone Yes I can ignore it but it s ugly and reminds me of Big Brother Google s thought police at work 
len ratingone Android users have suffered this plight and now its hit iPhone users 
len ratingone Apparently you can disable if roundaboutly suggested content on every platform except iOS 
len ratingone Google 
len ratingone I DO NOT want suggested news articles on my new tab page 
len ratingthree Love the app but I cant in good conscious give it starts if I can t install extensions 
len ratingthree I mean what the point of not having continuity between my desktop site to my mobile tablet 
len ratingthree We are download the apps and buy the phones tablets to be connected 
len ratingthree Why don t my extensions sync and stay connected weather I m on my desktop or phone tablet 
len ratingthree Thanks and I hope google addresses the missing extension from the app 
len ratingthree Eric
len ratingone Need I say more 
len ratingone Terrible move this is the same reason people have quit using Facebook 
len ratingone Think of a better way to generate revenue or be satisfied with reaching the maturity of your business model sell out completely and gracefully step aside 
len ratingone The population doesn t need more news feeding ego 
len ratingone Figure out a way to help your fellow man instead of enabling the wrong in the world 
len ratingone When you pull the keyboard there is lag on the suggested sites pulling up 
len ratingone It always pulls me to a site instead of allowing the keyboard 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone star 
len ratingfive I just wish I could set this as the default browser on my iPhone but that s Apple for you 
len ratingfive Always jealous if you don t use their stuff 
len ratingtwo Now I can t copy save images even if they re open in a new tab 
len ratingtwo Can t even properly save new bookmarks now 
len ratingtwo  Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingtwo If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingfive It should something that s lower than 
len ratingone I would like to give it negative stars if possible 
len ratingone Whoever had the idea for the suggested content to just pop up at bottom of page should be fired 
len ratingone I will delete Chrome if I can t stop it 
len ratingone Uninstalled 
len ratingone Thank you for making your browser significantly worse 
len ratingtwo I can t save pictures with Chrome anymore 
len ratingtwo It used to be a top browser too bad 
len ratingtwo I know iOS is also a real piece of work too 
len ratingtwo  Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingtwo If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingthree  Please provide Casting option in the mobile app
len ratingtwo what s the difference between this app and app google 
len ratingfive This is a fantastic app that gives you the opportunity to answer fun and interesting questions while making a bit of cash on the side 
len ratingfive This is recommended for anyone and everyone 
len ratingfive You will not regret your choice of downloading this wonderful service 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone Still Never works on forums or sites that are similar 
len ratingone It ll bring the site up then it ll bring up a loading symbol and nothing happens 
len ratingone Safari never does this 
len ratingone I ll be using safari until this is fixed 
len ratingone They ve done multiple updates since I first complained about this and still nothing 
len ratingone  Hi Jaybird is the page you try to load all in blank or half in blank 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingthree The app works pretty well 
len ratingthree However you cannot save anything to google drive from within this app 
len ratingthree Please change this so I can save PDFs to my Google Drive 
len ratingfive Currently an issue where I can t save images it s a downside but the app works just fine Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingfive If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone Any time you open a new tab Chrome shows annoying article suggestions 
len ratingone There is no way to turn them off 
len ratingone And google tracking everything you do
len ratingone I m back to using Safari and Firefox 
len ratingone The latest Chrome has a newsfeed on the Google Homepage that cannot be removed 
len ratingone It is a distraction and a nuisance the next step is probably direct advertising 
len ratingone  The new feature of showing news is totally bs just wasting everyone s data and time whoever put in the feature should be fired why there is no setting to turn off the recommended news this is the only google service software I m using will leave if this is still going when new version comes out at least on iOS there are other browsers 
len ratingfive There is Evereything on this
len ratingtwo I always used Google Chrome over any other browser but the new update which now puts suggested news articles on the new tab page is extremely annoying 
len ratingtwo I searched to find a way to disable this feature but apparently there is none 
len ratingtwo I will most likely use the other alternatives now 
len ratingone U cant save pictures in full screen please solve it Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingone If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone  rt
len ratingone I use Chrome and enjoy it but I am not interested in seeing suggested content when I open a new tab 
len ratingone Please give us an option to disable it 
len ratingone I prefer a distraction free browsing experience 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingthree  chrome flag 
len ratingtwo I m a big Chrome fan but recently they started including news on the New tab screen which means I have to look at Donald Trump every time I want to go to a web page
len ratingfive I am a big Chrome fan and when I saw the app for iPhone I had to download it 
len ratingfive Overall the app is wonderful 
len ratingfive I enjoy that you can access your desktop bookmarks on their iPhone 
len ratingone I ve used Chrome since it s existence even used it on my Apple devices 
len ratingone Unfortunately with the latest thought process not allowing you to remove suggested articles on the new tab page I can t support Chrome on iOS anymore 
len ratingone It feels like an invasion of privacy 
len ratingone I was already switching between Safari Chrome on iOS for testing purposes and this solidified it 
len ratingone Safari is easier to use on iOS plus the web browser test show its a little faster and I can use quality ad blockers 
len ratingone I ll continue to use Chrome on my MacBook and Windows desktop since Safari doesn t support YouTube s encoding for K but I m done with them on iOS 
len ratingone Google please don t screw up Gmail it s all I have left 
len ratingfive  Mac iOS Android 
len ratingfive Has everything needed for a search engine 
len ratingone I have absolutely loved chrome and all google apps on my iPhone until now 
len ratingone I agree with what other users have said that it s impossible to avoid the horrible news headlines and it s extremely frustrating to see it on the new tabs page now with no option to disable it 
len ratingone It instantly makes me angry and often distracts me from what I got on the internet for in the first place thanks to suggestions like famous actor accused of sexual assault again or Trump does something stupid again 
len ratingone Just what I wanted to see 
len ratingone Never thought I would be doing this but I guess I ll have to find a different browser app 
len ratingfive Really good it works quickly 
len ratingone You removed google play store from the App Store seriously that just plain stupid it was he only good thing you had going for you and all these browsers are just google chrome with a different name 
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingfive Google Chrome works so much faster and is much more organized than Safari 
len ratingfive I recommend it to anyone 
len ratingone He last update messed this app up for me now nothing loads the webpages do nothing can sit on a single screen for a half an put nothing happens
len ratingfive Never fails to provide me with the best sites and information I needed 
len ratingfour I like it
len ratingtwo The Chrome browser itself is fine fast and reasonably stable 
len ratingtwo But the once clean new tab page is now cluttered with news headlines 
len ratingtwo And as you can imagine with what s going on in the world today they re almost entirely inappropriate for younger users 
len ratingtwo Hey Google 
len ratingtwo You ve already built a perfectly fine news tab into the search results 
len ratingtwo Don t force it 
len ratingone  thetoprewards com popup hijacked my screen and there was no way to shut browser and reboot so just had to delete app 
len ratingone Worrisome how easily hacked this browser can be 
len ratingfive Best browser across all the platforms 
len ratingfive Muy til preciso y completo
len ratingone  Recommended articles are very annoying 
len ratingtwo They added advertisements to the new tab page and that s a bit too unethical for me 
len ratingfive My favorite browser 
len ratingfive Keep making it better 
len ratingfive  bug 
len ratingfive  It s good for me
len ratingtwo I m a pretty massive fan of this browser and I d consider myself a fairly advanced Google user 
len ratingtwo However the recent addition of the tabloid trash ads is certainly not welcome 
len ratingtwo I go to Chrome for a solid browsing experience not to be bombarded with garbage news which I could just seek out on my own while using Chrome 
len ratingtwo IF I WANTED TO READ THAT CRAP 
len ratingtwo Having it forced on me is beyond inappropriate and I will not change this review until that feature is removed 
len ratingfive Fast and stable 
len ratingfive Best browser 
len ratingfive Syncs all my devices effortlessly 
len ratingfive Thank y all
len ratingfour Excellent
len ratingthree Please make an option to turn off suggested articles like almost every other browser has 
len ratingthree I like the Google app ecosystem and how everything integrates but the new tab page is so distracting 
len ratingthree I get my news from other apps including other Google apps and don t need your clutter 
len ratingthree iOS forces the use of the same rendering engine for browsers so adding features that people can t change is moot because I ll just switch to a competitor 
len ratingone How do you disable Suggested articles 
len ratingone I have an iPhone which comes with Safari but I never liked Safari 
len ratingone I always used Google Chrome as it was fast reliable and easy 
len ratingone All of a sudden whenever I open a new tab on Chrome there s news stories forced down my throat just like Facebook 
len ratingone I m sick of seeing the news and their negativity fear mongering 
len ratingone If Google would just make it possible to disable this feature which NO ONE asked for then I would stick with them 
len ratingone But Google refuses to make it optional they force negative news down your throat 
len ratingone It s no wonder so many Americans are on anti depressants and anti anxiety meds who can blame them when the negative media is forced down our throats at every turn 
len ratingone Shame on you Google 
len ratingthree I ve always liked this app 
len ratingthree The new news feeds that have been added I absolutely do not like 
len ratingfive I like google products best web browser
len ratingtwo Can t go more than pages without it crashing and lagging 
len ratingtwo Have to close it and reopen it EVERYTIME 
len ratingtwo Used to love it but guess it s time to go back to Safari 
len ratingfour Has some bugs
len ratingone Let me preface this by saying we ve stopped using Facebook due to the Featured Articles being pushed on us deleted Twitter because we can t search without being bombarded by politics and Trending News and hidden every Featured News story on Snapchat because we don t want to come to a homepage where everything is about Trump or some other tragic event that occurred in the world 
len ratingone Users are sentient beings 
len ratingone Every single thing that is not the main functionality of a system needs to be optional for the user 
len ratingone We want to customize our viewing experience 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Is 
len ratingone Everyone 
len ratingone Creating 
len ratingone Suggested 
len ratingone Content 
len ratingone And not letting ANYONE opt out of it 
len ratingone Why is it permanent 
len ratingone What exactly goes through the Dev s mind when they re forcing content upon users 
len ratingone Do they think yeah they ll like this everyone else is doing it Everyone else might be doing it but why are you conforming to that hellish trend 
len ratingone Commonalities between platforms do not equate to happy users and once users get tired of one part of a platform they leave the entire platform only to find EVERY OTHER platform offers that same functionality thanks to everyone copying one another 
len ratingone Users have no safe place from politics or trending news articles suggested content or forced suggestions 
len ratingone You would almost think that Google actually wants people to put their app down and spend time with their family in the real world 
len ratingone I can turn off the news on my television an age old system that everyone has because it s customizable 
len ratingone Users don t have to watch what they don t want to watch 
len ratingone It s almost like news doesn t appear on every single channel you get that right 
len ratingtwo Have been using Chrome for years 
len ratingtwo I liked the simplicity and unobtrusiveness 
len ratingtwo However with the recent update the search page is now flooded with news stories 
len ratingtwo Obnoxious irrelevant intrusive news stories 
len ratingtwo Look if I wanted this I d use Yahoo 
len ratingtwo Please give us the option to turn the news stories off 
len ratingtwo This is absurd 
len ratingfive  G dang N 
len ratingfour The suggested news sites were annoying but I finally figured out how to turn them off 
len ratingfive I use it all the time when i need something
len ratingone Take the news crap off 
len ratingone If I want news I ll go to the news app
len ratingone Pages don t format correctly on IPhone X 
len ratingone When I think I m tapping on an option such as editing a post on reddit it instead hits the option right under it like the page is not centered correctly 
len ratingthree  Since the latest update the webpages in the Google Chrome load slower and the screen sometimes freezes up while scrolling up or down 
len ratingthree I hope this is fixed soon 
len ratingthree I also wish that there was a home button in this app because having to keep pushing the back button constantly to get back to the original home screen is annoying 
len ratingthree Other than that the app works fine 
len ratingone Remove them 
len ratingone Add an option to remove them 
len ratingone Annoying 
len ratingone Cluttering 
len ratingone Unnecessary 
len ratingfive It handles multiple tabs beautifully and is a solid alternative to Safari 
len ratingfive Overall it has lots of functionality and is a must download app 
len ratingone Remove the forced stories on new page 
len ratingone  Spamming me with news splarg on every new tab
len ratingfive That s it 
len ratingfive I don t use anything else 
len ratingtwo I hate that the app is suddenly showing me suggested content on the home page 
len ratingtwo I get enough suggestions with every other app I don t need any additional ones 
len ratingtwo With no option to completely turn them off I deleted this app 
len ratingtwo Bummed that I have to use Safari now but at least they aren t throwing unsolicited content at me 
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingfive Google is my go to for every unsure answer that i may have not to mention my guide when i dont know my way around 
len ratingfive Grdvt
len ratingtwo One of the reasons I used chrome was because it did not have adds or try to get me to look at things that I don t want to look at 
len ratingtwo Latest update has a news feed at bottom of screen 
len ratingtwo Will be uninstalling until they give a way to disable this feature or they completely remove it 
len ratingtwo Its very disappointing 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Love it prefer it over Safari
len ratingfive Absolutely great to look up topics
len ratingfive It s Safari but better 
len ratingfive Simple as that 
len ratingfive Absolutely user friendly and highly effective app 
len ratingfive Chrome keeps me protected and runs fast 
len ratingfive I love how it connects to my desktop and I can AirPrint 
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingfive I use this app daily finds what I m looking for
len ratingone Cluttering up the new tab page was OK Now I have a news feed on what used to be a clean page 
len ratingone Just unnecessary clutter and no ability to remove that I have found 
len ratingone Minimalism is a good thing 
len ratingone Get rid of this garbage 
len ratingone You ruined a great app 
len ratingone Deleting and going back to Safari 
len ratingfive Not always perfect but without question the best 
len ratingfour  It is very annoying Sorry for criticising this app for actually what is a ios functionality 
len ratingfive  When I need to browse the internet for help or for entertainment google chrome is always my go to 
len ratingfive Google chrome is your standard easy to use browser that lets you do nearly everything you can do on the computer version of google chrome 
len ratingfive You can find pictures visit websites go into incognito mode and google chrome even blocks pop ups for me now 
len ratingfive I highly recommend anyone this browser 
len ratingfive For your phone and your computer 
len ratingfive But there s one problem I have with google s chromebook Google s very own computer 
len ratingfive The problem is that it cannot open EXE files 
len ratingfive Which really disappointed me 
len ratingfive The chromebook that I use is much faster than my windows computer 
len ratingfive  The desktop loads almost instantly and google chrome runs faster on it Google s chromebook is your standard easy to use computer that can do pretty much what computers are designed for 
len ratingfive But if you re thinking about getting steam on one and playing your favorite games that are EXE you re out of luck 
len ratingfive There has yet to be an app that lets you do that 
len ratingfive You can still play flash games on your browser as chromebooks have flash built in 
len ratingfive And the chrome web store has some pretty fun apps as well as some great emulators including a GBA emulator Snes and nes emulator 
len ratingfive I never use any other browsers at all 
len ratingfour The Google Chrome App is definitely fast and has its issues from time to time but overall it s good 
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingfive I love it and I ve been using FOR EV ER now 
len ratingfive Definitely my first choice when it comes to mobile browsing 
len ratingfive Come on it s way better than safari 
len ratingfive I mean 
len ratingfive Come on 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive Never have a significant problem and even when the app crashes It restores the pages that were open 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Somehow fast sometime may
len ratingfive Chrome is the browser of the age 
len ratingtwo Add a STOP button so I don t have to kill the tab 
len ratingfive tnx for app
len ratingone Tired of the chrome crash syndrome switching back to safari 
len ratingfour When will saving a link icon to home screen be added 
len ratingfour Is it possible 
len ratingfour Please please please 
len ratingone Malware web pages open and can t be closed requiring uninstall 
len ratingone Have trouble saving images holding on images doesn t bring up dialog options Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingone If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingthree Unable to download pictures in new version Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingthree If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfive I love chrome 
len ratingfive Who doesn t 
len ratingfive I just wish you were able to cast from the chrome APP 
len ratingfive usually on safari i cant press homework help but with the google chrome i can 
len ratingthree I love Google 
len ratingthree I have Chrome on most of my devices 
len ratingthree However there are tasks that Chrome just isn t good at on an iPad 
len ratingthree I have an iPad Pro and I use it for school 
len ratingthree I read a lot of journal articles so I want to view and edit PDFs 
len ratingthree I have Adobe Acrobat which is the easiest app to use for this task 
len ratingthree However Chrome doesn t seem to want to transfer the PDF to Adobe Acrobat 
len ratingthree It isn t an option and I can t add it 
len ratingthree I tried the Safari app and this process was very easy 
len ratingthree I will still use Chrome for most things but Safari is a bit better at more advanced iPad functions 
len ratingthree Chrome just isn t optimized for the iPad 
len ratingthree But it s free so try it out 
len ratingfour Overall great app been using it for years 
len ratingfour I do more web surfing on my iOS devices than any others and always use this app 
len ratingfour However one feature that has been missing since I started using it is to close all tabs at once 
len ratingfour You have to hit the x on every open tab and often I have more than open during a typical browsing session 
len ratingfour This can be annoying especially when I come back later and all my old tabs are open still scrolling to the end of the tabs to start a new tab is also annoying 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive I have been using the Chrome since my last review 
len ratingfive It has so much to offer 
len ratingfive I just like it so much 
len ratingfive It is valuable tool to keep your various thoughts in order 
len ratingfive This is a very used App 
len ratingfive I was wondering if there was a section for Journaling 
len ratingfive Like you spot something suspicious 
len ratingfive Or search for an answer Phsychiatry question 
len ratingfive I mean keeping track with thoughts that just pop up but no place to enter for a follow up later 
len ratingfive Anamika
len ratingone Usually got virus by this app deleted it
len ratingfour I wish that it could make me open the pdf files that I download from chrome browser in other pdf reading apps such as pdf expert Adobe pdf pdfelement etc because open in feature really has a constrained options
len ratingone Can t erase all the pages viewed last one stay on and I need to close and open google app coz it freezes
len ratingthree Chrome won t let me save pictures on a website 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingthree I hold my finger on the picture and nothing happens 
len ratingthree  Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingthree If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingthree Fine web browser although the most recent update made it so when you tap to clear search history and then tap either button or the pop up to confirm or deny it will also access whatever search result is behind the pop up which is a little annoying 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s still Google 
len ratingfour I have been using iPhone for almost years now and I would say the device is still working well maybe not at its peak Chrome isn t anymore optimized for iPhone or similar phones due to poor memory utilization However it s a great browser for newer phones if not its greater memory consumption makes it more of a desktop class web browser than of a mobile device which runs on a limited battery 
len ratingtwo With the release of the most recent iOS and its many system updates I have major issues with this app 
len ratingtwo It regularly closes ALL of my open tabs with no option to restore the prior tabs 
len ratingtwo I often have information that I need to refer to in the open tabs 
len ratingtwo This is more than frustrating 
len ratingtwo This has me searching for a new app to use for this purpose 
len ratingtwo I m disappointed Google with the performance of the current chrome 
len ratingtwo Do you suffer from constant interface freezes 
len ratingtwo Does the touchpad on your screen stop working while you re using it 
len ratingtwo Does it stop working when you re not using it 
len ratingtwo Your problem might be the chrome app 
len ratingtwo  It might also be a hardware issue I m a hardcore google apps user but this app is the devil 
len ratingtwo Deleting it has pretty much made my phone use able again 
len ratingtwo From infuriating device of irritation back to mini pocket dream computer 
len ratingtwo Delete it today 
len ratingone  Ive used this app on my phone for years with no real issues 
len ratingone Its been very dependable and reliable 
len ratingone For my business I usually kept tabs open for different things and can always cone back to them when needed 
len ratingone Well last night something made the app crash and i just lost all of those tabs when i reopened it 
len ratingone Everything gone 
len ratingone Ans now my business is going to suffer because of everything i just lost 
len ratingone I am seriously bummed about this and i dont even want to use your app again now unbelievable 
len ratingfour I have to use Safari to go to certain forum web sites 
len ratingfour The page would just have a nonstop loading ring 
len ratingfour It seems to be by forums that use VBulletin Maybe you can let us know if the issue is with them or you 
len ratingthree So I was going on a third party website to press something until I ve gotten this error saying I need to call a gooddamn numbers because it is claiming that they have my phone number password to everything and my email soo whenever I clicked cancel it still pops up everytime I open up Google chrome app so thats why I deleted it
len ratingone Was my go to browser 
len ratingone Has been very glitchy with ios 
len ratingone Horrible at handling pop ups 
len ratingone Back to safari 
len ratingthree I can t save images on my iPhone anymore 
len ratingthree Can you please fix this problem 
len ratingthree  Hi there are you not able to save the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingthree If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingfour A great overall browser 
len ratingfour iPhone X support is awful though 
len ratingfour The top chrome looks amazing in portrait and it stays there for the top notch and ears 
len ratingfour But stays there for absolutely no reason in landscape 
len ratingfour Amazing browser and this is just a fluke because the iPhone X just came out just wanted to bring that to the Chrome team s attention 
len ratingone I hope you all like ads because this browser has a ton of them 
len ratingone So my headlines used to be dark blue but now they are light blue 
len ratingone I ve tried deleting and reinstalling the App times and my headlines are still light blue 
len ratingone It s too light to read 
len ratingone I really do not like this 
len ratingone I ve sent feedback twice on this issue and no response from the Google team 
len ratingone I even reported the issue 
len ratingone No response 
len ratingone I want my dark blue headliners back 
len ratingone I use Chrome all the time 
len ratingone This was happening before my new update to my phone and still happening after the update 
len ratingone Not a very happy customer right now 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingfour  devtool 
len ratingfour  iPhones iPhoneplus 
len ratingtwo Update after last patch the symptoms are Super slow takes several minutes to load something as basic as a shoppify page 
len ratingtwo not my internet im getting almost mbps on wifi according to the Speedtest app i have google fiber gigabit No more oh snap just blank pages 
len ratingtwo Browser also now becomes entirely locked up requiring phone reboot 
len ratingtwo  Ever since ios the app goes oh snap and when i reload the page or restart the app it will only load part of the page then its just white 
len ratingtwo Clearing cache and cookies helps for a page load or but then it happens again 
len ratingtwo Reinstalling the app is better but still only a few page loads before it breaks again 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo  Seriously about to go back to firefox fir everything if this doesn t get sorted out soon 
len ratingfour Google chrome has everything I need in a browser except for the ability to reverse image search an image from my photos 
len ratingfour Other than that it s been perfect 
len ratingthree Chrome works well and everything but when I get a pop up ad a dialogue box comes up and there s no way to avoid clicking it 
len ratingthree Even force closing and re opening brings up the same pop up ad 
len ratingone Can t save images when you hold down tap 
len ratingone Nothing 
len ratingone Another google project that should be shut down 
len ratingone You morons are losing device sales because you can t even make a single good product to compete with iMessage 
len ratingone Allo is a pile of trash 
len ratingone Hangouts is a rubbish 
len ratingone Your Message app is from you goons 
len ratingone Some teenager made a better app 
len ratingone  Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image

len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone Cant believe someone at google thought qr codes were more useful than pasting a search query from the clipboard 
len ratingtwo Can t save images from a tab with only the image very annoying

len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone won t let me add addresses or credit cards in autofill annoying
len ratingthree I might ve had too many bookmarks by but wish the app didn t crash right after crashing
len ratingfive Love Google love the security features love the search features only thing needing improvement is their newest program of reverse image search 
len ratingfive For example If I post a particular weaving loom I know it s wood I d like to see a little more besides boards and X s lol Also the security features of other apps and devices trying to sign into my account has saved me a few times 
len ratingfive It s amazing the number of hackers that are out there working to steal your information like this morning at am in Lima Per when I live stateside 
len ratingfive Nice try you dirty s Googles all over that 
len ratingfive shut down 
len ratingthree As much as I love using Chrome and it s integration and sync across multiple devices and operating systems in its current state it s pretty lousy 
len ratingthree I can no longer click to hold and save a lot of images across the web so I can t send even the dankest of memes to my homies 
len ratingthree For shame 
len ratingthree  Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingthree If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone For the last days the app will not open at all uninstalled and reinstalled it twice still the same problem it just won t open 
len ratingthree  chrome 
len ratingfour So far I don t have any problem but after updating to the latest version i can t save picture from a website anymore 
len ratingfour I could just touch and hold on to the picture that I want to save but now I can t anymore 
len ratingfour Can you look into this problem 
len ratingfour  Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingfour If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone  The newest update has ruined my workflow on my phone to the point where I m going to have to use a competitors browser 
len ratingone I can no longer select copy or save any images in an individual tab or from any website including my own 
len ratingone All my permissions are set correctly in the settings 
len ratingone I can t even select an image now on any webpage especially when I open image in its on tab 
len ratingone  Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingone If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingtwo More often than not I get pages that are only half loaded 
len ratingtwo Doesn t matter how long I wait it only loads half the page which isn t so helpful 
len ratingtwo And Google don t point fingers at the webmasters for these pages because you will have some pointing back at you as I have had Google search pages only load half way too 
len ratingtwo The other main problem I have is the crashing 
len ratingtwo While this absolutely isn t specific to iOS it has been an issue with all iOS versions and all app iterations it just seems to be worse since the into of 
len ratingtwo I hate Safari with an absolute passion but I have been forced to use it I it makes me crazy come on guys do a girl a solid and get it together will ya 
len ratingtwo I get kicked off games after starting to play 
len ratingtwo I also don t like I have to pick a way to send texts such as Loud or gently 
len ratingtwo Or rewrite it 
len ratingtwo Because there is no option to just send and for some reason most of the time my texts get sent there to pick a feeling loud gentle ect 
len ratingtwo These last two have many issues 
len ratingtwo I am really irritated a lot about this Signed Patti Maynard
len ratingone Literally who decided to put it right under new incognito tab like I didn t ask for all my tabs to be closed but here I am
len ratingfour Before when D Touch pulled up options the widget was to fast open a link on the clipboard 
len ratingfour Now it shows suggested sites and I don t really like that 
len ratingfour Being able to fast open a link made web navigating a lot faster 
len ratingfour Otherwise the app is still great 
len ratingtwo It ll load some forums completely and on others it loads them then they go away after about seconds and they can t be viewed again unless I close the tab and search for it again super frustrating any fix available 
len ratingone I m fed up with having to delete and reinstall due to Chrome being hijacked by malicious sites 
len ratingone The other browsers don t seem to suffer from this as much 
len ratingone It has gotten to be every day so I guess I m done giving Chrome a chance 
len ratingone Which is too bad because I liked the feature set 
len ratingfour I love the way Chrome works on my iPad but there is something that I want to suggest 
len ratingfour Is it possible that a readers view can be added 
len ratingfour That way you can read an article on the internet without all the adds the way that s Safari does it 
len ratingfour Hate to reference that browser but I like Chrome better and I would like to see that functionality added 
len ratingthree Your suppress dialog function does not work and will freeze my chrome which makes me have to reinstall every day
len ratingone  VPN 
len ratingthree As of the last update the ability to hold down on an image to bring up options has been either removed or broken 
len ratingthree  Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingthree If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone  Have to now type two letters instead of just the first of the URL before I can hit the go button otherwise it s just greyed out Only loads websites partially e g Engadget when scrolling down often having tons of whitespace unrendered parts of the website and that in an iPhone s plus No support feedback on the app Bad ux on a big phone why is the URL bar and back button at the top 
len ratingone I cannot reach that in one handed mode 
len ratingone Going back to safari the only thing that come iOS has going for it the I can share the page history otherwise it s just clunky and slow
len ratingone Hey Google Tell me why is Chrome crazing like crazy lately both on my iPhone s Plus and iPad Air 
len ratingone Both are still on iOS It keeps freezing or loading half then reload into a page saying cannot load page Or it crash entirely 
len ratingone What have you done with the codes underneath Chrome 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingfive I love google chrome it helps me because if I search up khan academy it does not take days it is fast and this has been an awesome thing for me if it takes longer then some of my khan academy assignments might be late Google chrome is awesome 
len ratingthree When I m browsing the web sometimes when I click on a link or a article I want to read it won t work so I have to close the app or refresh the page to get it to work
len ratingtwo I have chrome cast for my T V 
len ratingtwo So we stream Netflix YouTube also websites or movies online I play from my iMac computer on the google chrome browser 
len ratingtwo On the iMac you can cast your screen to the TV chrome cast however on the iPhone google chrome app you CANNOT cast from iPhone TV 
len ratingtwo Google should make it so you can cast from any device 
len ratingtwo There s other apps that allow you to cast from phone such as iWeb tv and TV Cast 
len ratingtwo That s my review
len ratingthree What happened to long hold to save images 
len ratingthree I used to be able to select an image opt to open it in a new tab 
len ratingthree Then I could long hold and there would be a menu search google for the image open image save image etc 
len ratingthree I can t get that anymore 
len ratingthree How am I supposed to find and save images in high quality when I can t long hold to search or save anymore 
len ratingthree  Hi we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingthree Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingone Garbage
len ratingthree Infected sites that seize Chrome with Phony virus alert dialogs can t be stopped 
len ratingthree Suppress dialog option doesn t work 
len ratingthree Requires a delete reinstall of Chrome 
len ratingthree Need to kill the recurring dialog without deleting everything else 
len ratingtwo Chrome is either resetting and saying it s not shutting down successfully web pages are reloading or it quits and you have to load previous pages from memory 
len ratingfour  Hi there are you not able to download the image in a tab there s nothing on that page but an image 
len ratingfour If that s the case we ve filed crbug com 
len ratingfour Thanks 
len ratingone  I had this at stars but just deleted the app so it gets a star 
len ratingone There seem to be a lot of freezing and half loaded pages 
len ratingone I thought it was the site I was visiting but on Safari I don t see that issue 
len ratingone I even have the problem visiting Amazon 
len ratingone Refreshing does nothing 
len ratingone I have tried refreshing 
len ratingone I have deleted and reinstall but the problem persist 
len ratingone This all started with the iOS upgrade 
len ratingone I do not have this problem with other browsers 
len ratingone  Hi MikeCQ are you still seeing half loaded pages after updating to the latest version 
len ratingone Does refreshing the page make Chrome load pages fully 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive Works wonderfully 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingtwo  Why is there no tab switching hotkey like in Safari 
len ratingtwo Please emulate that hotkey from Safari for using a keyboard with an iPad i e 
len ratingtwo the Smart Keyboard 
len ratingfour When I zoom in near a text box it used to always just zoom in and stop 
len ratingfour Now it will go into typing mode which sometimes I don t want 
len ratingfour I unpinch to zoom out but if I m close enough it will zoom back in to the text field 
len ratingfour Please fix change 
len ratingtwo Latest iOS on iPhone now seems to have issues with Chrome 
len ratingtwo Screens freeze and become unresponsive or just go black for no particular reason 
len ratingfive  Safari 
len ratingfour On android you select picture and shows options to share directly without having to save image to your phone 
len ratingfour Safari has that on iOS but not chrome 
len ratingfour Android you need to add that 
len ratingfour Lol
len ratingone I had to delete my Gmail app because it wouldn t scrub out my account name in the sign up 
len ratingone So I used gmail in Chrome thinking I would just clear the data to sign out but no it will not sign out of my account ever giving anyone the right to see my emails 
len ratingone If there s a way to do this it s hidden 
len ratingone What kind of privacy protection is this 
len ratingone I deleted my Chrome browser off my iPad 
len ratingone Screw you Google 
len ratingthree I am using a first generation iPad Pro 
len ratingthree Whenever Chrome encounters an unresponsive web page fairly often it just locks it up 
len ratingthree The quickest way to get back to work is to delete it and reinstall it 
len ratingfive  uc chrome 
len ratingone Hurry up and fix it already Google 
len ratingone It was a star app 
len ratingone Its not right now 
len ratingfour This is the best browser I ve tried on both iOS and Android but both mobile versions are lacking in one feature search engines 
len ratingfour Both mobile versions of the browser only offer five search engines 
len ratingfour Is it possible to allow different more in the forthcoming builds of Chrome 
len ratingfour I know the desktop version allows engines 
len ratingfive  vpn 
len ratingthree They need extensions which would make this app way better
len ratingone Ever since the update before last my YouTube videos hardly ever load so that I can actually watch them they are hidden behind the play arrow and a buffer symbol 
len ratingone Not only that I am not longer able to pause play or make full screen on my iPhone my iOS is still at however I don t think this is the issue at all 
len ratingfive I always use chrome wherever be it phone pc or laptop 
len ratingone  Used to be my favorite browser 
len ratingone But nowadays 
len ratingone More and more often broken links stuff won t load constant bull 
len ratingone Just loaded version and found it to be slower and would not load entire articles from both Washington Post NYTimes despite sitting right next to WiFi 
len ratingone My year old Kindle fire runs faster 
len ratingone  Hi Fred we re working on this issue 
len ratingone Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfive It is the best brousing sight
len ratingone I used to be able to hold down and a pop up would ask to save photo or cancel now nothing happens 
len ratingone I restarted the app and phone to no avail Hi AndrewS we ve filed crbug com for this issue 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingone This update of the app won t let me scan the physical web
len ratingone Only loads half pages now 
len ratingone  Hi Jess we re working on this issue 
len ratingone Thanks for your feedback 
len ratingfive  vpn 
len ratingtwo Ok so I just went on my iPad to get google chrome but it said OPEN so I pressed it and nothing happens so I closed the App Store to just press on the symbol thingy but nothing was there can u or apple please fix this
len ratingtwo  How can I stop auto refresh 
len ratingtwo It refreshes pages like YouTube videos 
len ratingfive  goole 
len ratingfour I have been using YouTube for ages for watching movies or listening to music or songs 
len ratingfour Never had to give my email address or password before 
len ratingfour I had no problem at all using it 
len ratingfour Did not ask for all this informations 
len ratingfour Having an iPad or iPhon with whatever email address or password I had put in before I could start using them was sufficient for it 
len ratingfour I just had to go to the YouTube and choose whatever I wanted to watch 
len ratingfour You have made so difficult now 
len ratingfour After all it s not a public property 
len ratingfour It is my personal device 
len ratingfour Would love D Touch options like safari to pop and peak at looks Bookmarks bar for iPad Omni bar to perform find in page function like safari instead of having to go to menu
len ratingone Since after I updated my iPad to iOS I have getting Aw Snap Error and Website getting crashes 
len ratingone I tried to clear cache and all other stuffs that might cause the problems Still facing same issues
len ratingone This is horrible they took away the physical Web now no one with iOS can find beacons 
len ratingfour  Test
len ratingone Horrible update 
len ratingone Can t save or do anything with photos from the internet 
len ratingone  Hi Europa we ve filed crbug com for this issue 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingfive Easy to use and bug free
len ratingtwo The new iOS update made this browser slow hopefully a fix is in the works otherwise I love the browser
len ratingone Your last update broke the app 
len ratingone Now it s not even opening 
len ratingthree Lately it seems that when using the little arrow in the top right of Chrome to copy a url to paste somewhere else the url info is pasted as duplicates 
len ratingthree Safari doesn t do this duplicate problem 
len ratingthree  Hi there This issue has been fixed in the latest Chrome version 
len ratingthree Thank you
len ratingfive I love DuckDuckGo and I use it on chrome on my laptop but for some reason it s not even an option here 
len ratingfive I d say this is somewhere he Firefox app actually does perfectly 
len ratingone I ve used Google Chrome on my iPhone as my primary web browser for around years consecutively and assumed wrongly that it was respecting my privacy 
len ratingone Today the app suggested I should log in as one of my main Gmail accounts when I visited the Settings menu 
len ratingone The app should not be able to know this information I ve never done any Gmail stuff from Chrome and I found this behavior not helpful but deeply creepy and disturbing 
len ratingtwo One of the last few updates broke most forum sites 
len ratingtwo Lots of glitches as well 
len ratingtwo I keep finding myself loading pages on chrome only to find out it s not working and then having to copy and paste he URL to safari 
len ratingtwo Guess I ll have to switch for now 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone Recently every couple of days I get a script popup that locks the browser 
len ratingone For security reasons I don t want to click the popup but I can t switch to another tab and the only way out of it is to uninstall and reinstall 
len ratingone The popup blocker does not help 
len ratingone I ve read online that this has been a known problem for years and still is not fixed 
len ratingone This has become so annoying I m going to have to stop using Chrome 
len ratingtwo Watching videos is very annoying having to watch a tiny box in the middle of the screen
len ratingfive  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
len ratingtwo Can you make it easy to change your password by pressing change your password
len ratingone After the major iOS update pages don t load all the way 
len ratingone It s seriously annoying 
len ratingone Get on the ball google 
len ratingone It s been weeks now 
len ratingone Anytime I want to get on the app it keeps saying you are watching porn or some thing like that and is giving me a notice saying I do which I m not I m and a girl ok my dude why would I do that gross 
len ratingone I m guessing it s a glitch or something stupid
len ratingtwo It used to be there and now it s not 
len ratingtwo Why Google 
len ratingtwo WHY 
len ratingtwo Why is everyone so in love with your products when you can t make a good one before releasing it 
len ratingtwo Drive is disorganized Chrome is inconsistent across different devices 
len ratingtwo This is absurd 
len ratingtwo I wish my job didn t require me to use google products 
len ratingtwo Such garbage 
len ratingone After upgrading to IOS Chrome requires one to allow access to your images read and write or you cannot save images 
len ratingone This is unacceptable to me 
len ratingone I don t want anyone in my stuff plain and simple 
len ratingone I ve used this browser without issue regularly for several years 
len ratingone It has been crashing and reloading over and over for some time now 
len ratingone I will be unloading it from my iPad until I see other reviews saying it has been repaired 
len ratingtwo I only like it when there is no internet because there is a game everything else is terrible Its just like safari 
len ratingfive Great it will open anything I want
len ratingfive Love it keep it fast a simple One request can you add Add one future for iPhone devices
len ratingone The only reason I use Chrome is the syncing of autofill field values across devices 
len ratingone With the latest version it shows me the autofill options but when I click it doesn t fill them in 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingfive Simply and faster
len ratingfour I ve been using Chrome since inception 
len ratingfour Since updating iPad with iOS I m having problems with screens stuck especially reading 
len ratingfour Though today and yesterday when trying to read in Kindle cloud reader in chrome SCREEN get stuck 
len ratingfour Then I have to turn off iPad and hopefully get back into chrome if screen releases it self 
len ratingfour Please help 
len ratingone  Chrome continues to crash on random webpages and be more unstable by each release 
len ratingone It is clear Google has done little to fix this problem nor provide any workarounds that actually work 
len ratingone What is infuriating is not only the crashes but after the crash webpages cannot be viewed in its entirety unless one closes the page and clears all history 
len ratingone There are some that say the problem is with Apple but this is bogus since one does not see this crash problem in Firefox or other non Apple browsers 
len ratingone As such one would be better off using anything than Chrome 
len ratingone Easily ruined with relentless messages by malicious websites 
len ratingthree A malicious dialog box pops up and no matter what you press it continues to pop up not allowing you to close the page or do anything 
len ratingthree Restarting the app doesn t work and neither does restarting the ipad 
len ratingone Keeps closing out of windows or websites and just crashing
len ratingfive  v
len ratingfive  vpn 
len ratingtwo One of the best iPhone features is D touch and after all these updates you haven t implemented to the app for iOS 
len ratingtwo There is a lot of things that you can do with D touch 
len ratingtwo Open tabs or change tabs are one of them 
len ratingtwo When you add something like that 
len ratingtwo Then I ll give more rating 
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingfive Great for xxx
len ratingone Read your reviews 
len ratingone Pages only load halfway then render white area scrolling beyond the viewport 
len ratingone You messed it up 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone I accidentally tapped a clickbait ad on a non mobile friendly website fumbling for the real link and now Chrome is unusable 
len ratingone Pop ups won t stop 
len ratingone I tried Suppress Dialogs turning off the networks all of them force quitting the app and restarting 
len ratingone Absolutely nothing works 
len ratingone I can t even imagine how you build a mobile version of a popular web browser and make something that literally would have to be deleted and re installed to be used 
len ratingone I am truly shocked that a giant company like Google can t handle common phishing trap trash like that 
len ratingone It is infuriating that after a decade of iPhone a web browser can exist to be installed on it that can t handle this 
len ratingone I am so glad I wasn t doing anything important 
len ratingfive I love chrome and google the search app but I think it would be a good idea of combining both apps into one like it ll probably be the ultimate searching app in the world but if that s too much for you then that s fine 
len ratingfive I still like both apps cause google amazing 
len ratingfive I love Chrome but since this latest iPhone update all video play has a delay as well and skips and repeats 
len ratingfive Please look into this with Apple 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfour This is the best browser for IOS but if possible can you make it so pages that create a certain amount of dialogue in on minute be blacklisted 
len ratingfour I had a page that would not let go i tried reloading the browser it just loaded in before i could delete it and if i pressed suppress dialogue it would just refresh itself and go again 
len ratingfour This was highly frustrating because now i have to reinstall the entire app just to get away from it 
len ratingone Within an open tab when in standard browser mode the menu items accessed by the vertical three dots in the upper right corner are unresponsive 
len ratingone I m still running iOS If I want to use the app I need to close all tabs and open a tab in incognito mode 
len ratingfive  app id
len ratingone  I had used Chrome before I loved everything about it but when I go to one of fav websites the scam icon comes on security breach call apple immediately pops up and I did everything to clear that scamming s t it still pop up 
len ratingone I will return when Chrome for the iPhone has a good malware automatically to stop that B S 
len ratingone scam popup 
len ratingone Ironically YouTube doesn t work on this browser whenever I watch a video none of the links to other videos work and the comments don t load 
len ratingone Nearly every day there will be a hour period where Chrome won t load anything 
len ratingone The search status bar looks complete but nothing loads and the screen stays gray 
len ratingone Really frustrating 
len ratingone Every other app including Safari continue to work fine 
len ratingone Was my favourite browser but I can t do anything now every link crashes the app 
len ratingfour Update The issue was fixed for about a month 
len ratingfour And then it decided to act up again 
len ratingfour If I want to view a link in my email I need to use Chrome for desktop 
len ratingfour In fact I normally view stuff in the Google app since Chrome doesn t work right as usual 
len ratingfour Normally I would give this app a higher rating but unfortunately it keeps crashing on me 
len ratingfour At first I thought it was because I was trying to send a link to a wedding site but then a link from an email kept crashing as I was trying to read a lengthy article enclosed 
len ratingfour It crashed three times in minutes 
len ratingfour I am not happy with chrome right now and unlike when this was happening with my Chrome browser on Windows last year I can t get Canary Chrome for this device to fix it myself 
len ratingfour  wifi 
len ratingone When I use chrome on the computer I don t understand why they have so many adds
len ratingone  Constantly crashes freezes up and interferes with the normally seamless operation of my device as it s cookies attempts to hijack my info 
len ratingone Once I close app and delete cookies device functions normal

len ratingfour This is generally a great app use it all the time but when you update be sure to bookmark every open tab 
len ratingfour I was doing research for a paper while on the train decided to update the app while i used the restroom smallest bathroom ever and when i came back to open it up again all windows i had were gone both ordinary and incagnito idk how to spell that 
len ratingfour So thanks to this browser i had to start all over 
len ratingfive  bbbbbbbbbbbbb
len ratingthree It s actually a great mobile browser and it syncs up well with the desktop version 
len ratingthree Without the ability to block ads however it s just not practical for everyday use 
len ratingtwo Please get rid of the pull to refresh 
len ratingtwo The same for all other swipe actions 
len ratingtwo If some odd person wants such features let them enable in settings 
len ratingtwo Such a pain when filling out forms and trying to scroll through the page only to have the page refresh and obliterate all of your entries 
len ratingtwo Also make the restore cancel button permanent until the user takes action 
len ratingtwo So many tabs lost when chrome crashes and the restore button disappears in milliseconds 
len ratingfive  Chrome QQ iOS Chrome Safari 
len ratingfive  vv 
len ratingone No matter how many times I delete and reinstall the app I keep getting the aw snap messages AND certain parts of videos played on the app keep repeating 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingone Chrome is unstable about of the time at websites I visit 
len ratingone These include mainstream sites eg NYT and WP with competent IT people 
len ratingone I have discontinued using Chrome rather than tolerate multiple crashes 
len ratingone Safari does not crash ever 
len ratingone Chrome is now completely useless and only shows the Chrome logo then kicks me out 
len ratingone Even after uninstallation and reinstallation it won t work 
len ratingone Safari is doing the same thing 
len ratingfour I like the app but it should be more like the computer version 
len ratingfour The chrome app looks plain boring 
len ratingfour My ipad shows icon as just Chrome vice Google Chrome so maybe not quite same app that I m reviewing 
len ratingfour Anyhow I do have the highest iOS that is available for this iPad so if there is a better version that corrected this disparity I apologize 
len ratingfour I may go back to the Google and read even though I get more than way into reading a good article it crashes and totally have to look for it all over again 
len ratingfour Hate how Apple treats their customers who can t keep going out to buy the latest iPhone iPod or iPad 
len ratingfour After awhile they quit supporting certain apps 
len ratingfour Maybe they could allow for a classic version of outdated apps 
len ratingtwo Have you ever wanted your every web search to be entirely sponsored content 
len ratingtwo Well now you can be fed incessant BS too 
len ratingone Used to love Chrome but now the browser keeps crashing and getting stuck 
len ratingone I reinstalled many times but it did not solve the problem 
len ratingone Had to go back to Safari now 
len ratingone They definitely are improving with every updates but still lots of glitches need to be fixed 
len ratingone For example the desktop requests do not always go through 
len ratingone After iOS update pages only load halfway 
len ratingone Requesting desktop version loads full page but this option cannot be permanently chosen 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone Doesn t load entire page very choppy and slow to respond
len ratingone Not working properly in iOS 
len ratingone Sites not loading properly 
len ratingone Reminds me of internet explorer 
len ratingfive  iPad 
len ratingthree  Good 
len ratingtwo Not sure what s going on with the most recent update but ever since I switched to the new version compatible with iOS I ve been struggling to get my browser pages to load all the way on my iPad 
len ratingtwo It often only loads the first section on the webpage that shows up in my screen but when I scroll down the rest of the page is blank 
len ratingtwo Reloading the page doesn t work either it simply just doesn t load correctly 
len ratingtwo I ve always loved chrome but it s useless right now and I have no choice but to switch to another browser 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingthree  ctrl w 
len ratingone  hours on screen hours background 
len ratingone What is chrome doing in background 
len ratingthree Decent browser but constantly crashes 
len ratingthree Since upgrading to iOS I m also having an issue with pop ups 
len ratingthree It s pretty annoying 
len ratingone What s so difficult to have a close all tabs button 
len ratingone How could anyone forgot about this function 
len ratingtwo The app half loads web pages and won t refresh or reload it properly 
len ratingtwo I love chrome but I think I ll have to start using safari 
len ratingtwo I can t read any of my articles 
len ratingfour This application would be perfect if I didn t have to reach my thumb to the top corner of my iPhone screen 
len ratingfour It becomes quiet uncomfortable after a good amount of web browsing 
len ratingfour Switching the new tab to the bottom of the screen would make opening new tabs a lot more user friendly and allow me to easily spend more time using chrome for info 
len ratingone Ironic 
len ratingone The search results page loads partially then stops 
len ratingone The loading wheel may be spinning or the page may indicate it has completed loading no spinner 
len ratingone No links on the search results list function 
len ratingone I think this is a new problem with this version 
len ratingone I have used chrome on my iPad forever and haven t had this issue before 
len ratingone Now it s happening all the time 
len ratingfour The only big complaint I have is that rarely the browser crashes along with some minor bugs like some websites not loading properly 
len ratingthree Three Major Problems When exporting PDF s from certain websites Microsoft SharePoint Server to other iOS apps the PDF s are corrupted and unreadable no matter which app I export to 
len ratingthree This does not happen with Safari which handles it perfectly 
len ratingthree  No way to manage passwords in iOS app only desktop app 
len ratingthree Far better support in Safari 
len ratingthree  Desktop app does not support reading list which Safari does 
len ratingthree Other than that I like Chrome better than Safari 
len ratingthree Don t make me switch 
len ratingone iOS updated to then and recently Chrome crashes more than ever and has become inoperable 
len ratingone Going to uninstall as it s non functional 
len ratingone I m disappointed as I use chrome across all platforms and now won t be able to use it unless it is fixed 
len ratingone Which is soon hopefully 
len ratingfive  hh
len ratingtwo I ve been using it for years and satisfied 
len ratingtwo The current version as of this date has problems with radio buttons rendering certain html code and other glitchy behavior 
len ratingtwo I hope they fix these bugs in a future release sooner rather than later 
len ratingone This used to be my go to browser but it constantly crashes on both the Plus and iPad Pro 
len ratingone Deleting both those copies now 
len ratingone Hopefully it will return to awesomeness but for now it s complete garbage 
len ratingone Aw Snap 
len ratingfive This browser is just amazing for mobile browsing and it s so fast 
len ratingfive But I would like to see a pull down from the Omni box to see all tabs like in android but overall great excperience and amazing job google
len ratingone  Chrome has a lot of good features and used to be excellent but the app has declined in quality and stability recently 
len ratingone Furthermore it s incompatible with reddit commenting and posting and even upvoting is not possible in it 
len ratingone I have to switch to safari for reddit 
len ratingone Bug 
len ratingone Load any web page 
len ratingone Click share button 
len ratingone Nothing happens 
len ratingone No share menu is displayed
len ratingfive YouTube should have a zoom so you can play while watching YouTube
len ratingone Like the title says Chrone has become unusable the app crashes constantly 
len ratingone Chrome on IPad and IPhone have become noticeably slower than it used to be 
len ratingone Chrome has been my primary browser on IPhone IPad and my MacBook from the beginning 
len ratingone I ve stuck with them through all the nonsense but because of the recent major issues I ve switched to another browser 
len ratingone On YouTube when the videos actually play and the app doesn t crash the controls do not work at all 
len ratingone You can t pause full screen or skip ahead 
len ratingone Because of this I have deleted Chrome from all of my devices until they fix it 
len ratingone If you like Google and Apple filtering your web sites regardless of your wishes this is the browser for you 
len ratingone Me I m going back to Dolphin where I can see any sites I like and don t get redirected to the App Store every time I visit a site with an app to promote 
len ratingtwo Chrome app for iOS has never really been the greatest 
len ratingtwo But now with ios it is honestly totally useless to me 
len ratingtwo One of the major things I do with my phone is look up questions that I have while I am out and about and usually the answers to those questions are found on forums 
len ratingtwo Well chrome will open up the forum page just fine then about seconds later the page will just go blank 
len ratingtwo Thought this might be a temporary issue but iOS has been out for a couple weeks and they ve had months with the beta 
len ratingtwo This should not be an issue 
len ratingtwo I guess I m stuck with safari until google can get it together 
len ratingone Started off being a fantastic device and worked really well 
len ratingone Then the updates game 
len ratingone Now the device is useless 
len ratingone Every time you try to make a call it crashes anytime you say OK Google it says I m sorry but right now is not a good time try back later 
len ratingone You have to unplug the device constantly to reset it 
len ratingone I would stick to looking at the echoes I hear they do pretty well 
len ratingone But I don t have any experience on them yet 
len ratingone I will soon however LOL 
len ratingthree It keeps freezing 
len ratingthree I like this chrome app but it crashes 
len ratingthree I like to look on amazon a lot but it freezes 
len ratingthree Please fix it so I can rate it better 
len ratingtwo Was awesome to see bookmarks look the way they should 
len ratingtwo However now you ve disabled the ability to open in a new tab 
len ratingtwo Seriously 
len ratingtwo What are you guys doing 
len ratingone This update has caused innumerable crashing Makes browsing rather frustrating 
len ratingone It doesn t matter if I switch to the mobile or desktop version of a site either 
len ratingone Please fix for iOS 
len ratingfive  low HIV 
len ratingfour  iPhone Safari 
len ratingfive I can find so many websites
len ratingthree  Decent but may break your heart 
len ratingthree Don t dare to use tabs the app periodically crashes and opens to a single blank tab where any previously open tabs are irretrievably gone 
len ratingthree Hopefully Chrome will implement some failsafe in the future to deal with failing and restarting gracefully 
len ratingthree Until then it s not really safe or dependable 
len ratingthree I d give it stars if I could 
len ratingfive Zero hour of TCI
len ratingfour Hi i love your browser 
len ratingfour Can you add two more keyboard shortcuts 
len ratingfour Cmd Shift Tab for Show previous tab Cmd Tab for show next tab That s the only reason i haven t made the full transition to chrome browser on iPad 
len ratingfour Thank you 
len ratingthree I love Google and Google Chrome is my preferred browser for pretty much anything but for the love of all that is held sacred on this Earth please update this app 
len ratingthree As of the most recent iOS update Chrome has been crashing constantly 
len ratingthree Most of your other Google apps have been updated to support iOS but Chrome hasn t 
len ratingthree How soon can we see an update

len ratingone Tired of my browser always closing the tabs I m trying to save 
len ratingone Back to Safari 
len ratingfive  chrome chrome chrome 
len ratingfour I think this is a very good app to use 
len ratingfour For
len ratingone The iOS update seems to have broken Chrome 
len ratingone I m surprised google with their infinite resources has not fixed this yet 
len ratingone In a lot of my open tabs the pages only load halfway 
len ratingone Bottom half of the pages are blank 
len ratingone I have to close the tab and reopen the page to get it working 
len ratingone Please fix currently using Safari because Chrome is too frustrating 
len ratingthree After updating for iOS Chrome is a lot less responsive than it used to be 
len ratingthree There s a lot of stutter and lag when clicking on something tabs also have a very high crash rate and there is currently the odd problem of a tab only being able to load of a page after idling for a while that you have to close and reopen from the recent tabs list to get to work again
len ratingtwo The browser is good and I enjoyed using it on my phone because I prefer Chrome on my other devices but the latest update wastes so much space on the browser to accommodate buttons I don t use 
len ratingtwo I I don t mind the ability to scan QR codes but the amount of real estate the button takes up on an IPhone s makes the browsing experience less less than ideal 
len ratingtwo Less is often more w interfaces Surprised any designer approved the latest updates 
len ratingthree Not sure if this is the app or my phone but youtube is currently no es bueno on chrome takes my entire life to load and then doesn t load in the bar at the bottom 
len ratingthree Sometimes doesn t even play the vid at all 
len ratingthree Hope it s not just a me thing
len ratingone FYI Google dropped don t be evil thing years ago 
len ratingtwo This browser is good don t get me wrong 
len ratingtwo But the only thing making this difficult and complicated is the fact that it constantly crashes and forces me to reinstall it time after time losing all the stuff I ve been working on and what s painful about that is it happens at random times 
len ratingtwo Hours and hours of work gone 
len ratingtwo I just hope that this gets fixed soon 
len ratingfour Schweet LET S EAT 
len ratingfive This app after the new update makes browsing so much easier because if I am doing homework I can open up a new tab and just start searching something else 
len ratingfive AMAZING 
len ratingone I don t like it because I have to sign in all the time for YouTube and I m a YouTuber and I use my grandmother s Account and I don t know her password so keep a person signed in 
len ratingone  Wi Fi 
len ratingtwo Every searches just stays on a gray screen 
len ratingtwo When search same string on safari it works fine so not a phone or internet issue 
len ratingfive Idk what to say about this app 
len ratingfive Best hands down
len ratingfive Google is a great search engine
len ratingfour Mostly accurate
len ratingfive This app is useful for me 
len ratingfive I use it constantly it is my favorite 
len ratingone I ve been a Google software supporter since the early times 
len ratingone Before iOS the app would crash and I don t know if the Devs team at Alphabet is actually doing anything with it 
len ratingone Now with iOS you can barely browse site before it crashes snap something went wrong yup the Devs team developing skills apparently 
len ratingfive  ok
len ratingfive Use it everyday 
len ratingfive But it s fast 
len ratingfive Even when I need to refresh the app it ultimately gets to the page faster than other apps 
len ratingtwo I don t think their app is like this on android junks but they don t care to bring the best quality for iOS users 
len ratingfive  Google Chrome Google Google WebKit Chrome GUI beta Windows Mac OS X Linux Android iOS Chrome 
len ratingfour  chrome 
len ratingfive Using this browser ever since and never had any issues 
len ratingfive  iOS 
len ratingfive it is fantastic
len ratingfive No problems what do ever
len ratingfive It helps me keep a tab on what my family does Making sure they don t do something they aren t supposed to be doing 
len ratingfive I have an iPhone but I hate Safari 
len ratingfive I was so happy when I found out I could use Chrome instead 
len ratingfive I downloaded it that day and never turned back 
len ratingfive Wish Apple would allow you to use Chrome for all internet links 
len ratingfive It makes life so much easier 
len ratingfive Use it all the time easy to navigate
len ratingfive I love that I can watch porn on this
len ratingfour  kissT Kr bank
len ratingfive  WaoooooaW
len ratingfive It s easy to use stable and free what else could you want 
len ratingone  A faking app
len ratingtwo The latest release more often than not only loads the content visible on the first page and does not load any content off screen that requires scrolling to access 
len ratingtwo The scrolling works but instead of displaying the rest of an article for instance it s just a big blank white nothing
len ratingfour This is my go to app for web 
len ratingfour I have found it easy to use and intuitive 
len ratingfive Downside is also that it keeps everything google accessible meaning google has your everything and don t think it sits there safely in private 
len ratingfive They can track everything you do 
len ratingfive But I still use it cuz it s not going to matter 
len ratingone You d figure with new iOS updates they would be ready 
len ratingone Pages don t load all the way now and still freezing daily 
len ratingfive  google 
len ratingfive Wonderful people really nice place to stay 
len ratingfive Very convenient location 
len ratingfive Close to Nashville and can take shuttle bus in and out of Nashville so you don t have to fight traffic 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingone It constantly crashes even after trying all their suggestions to fix it 
len ratingone It s simply not reliable as is 
len ratingone Every time I try to use the app on my iPhone plus it either crashes on me or shows the Aw Snap 
len ratingone page making it completely useless and I end up using bing or safari will be uninstalling again hopefully Google fixes this in the future 
len ratingone Why does it have to be what are you not letting kids be on the internet 
len ratingone Think again Google 
len ratingthree This app is great 
len ratingthree Easy to use browser 
len ratingthree There s only one problem with it 
len ratingthree If I update the app ALL OF MY TABS ARE DELETED 
len ratingthree Hundreds of tabs most of which were still used gone 
len ratingthree Just fix this one thing and all will be forgiven 
len ratingthree This is the second time I m dealing with this and I d rather not deal with it again 
len ratingtwo If a page is left for too long without being visited usually to where is reloads itself it gets messed up and only loads the part that was visible 
len ratingtwo If you scroll at all the rest of the page is just white and there is no way to fix it other than closing the tab and opening the page again 
len ratingtwo Refreshing the page or trying to go back and forward again does not help 
len ratingtwo This appears to only happen on iOS on my iPhone as it was not happening before yesterday 
len ratingtwo But since then it has been horrible 
len ratingtwo Hope they fix it soon
len ratingone Won t update on my phone and can t uninstall reinstall either 
len ratingone Space now occupied by com apple mobileinstall 
len ratingone FINALLY updated 
len ratingone Only took three weeks 
len ratingone Recently glitchy going back to safari
len ratingfive  Google keep 
len ratingone Takes tabs to bring up the keyboard and then after typing letters closes 
len ratingfive  qq 
len ratingfive Best app 
len ratingtwo It really likes to crash
len ratingfive  Google
len ratingfive Thank you google 
len ratingfive Allows everyone to ditch the spyware apps 
len ratingfive I use it on my desktop laptop my phone and pretty much every device I can put it on 
len ratingfive I ve been using chrome every since I was just a kid and there s definitely not a better web application than this 
len ratingfive it has more features than any other regular web browser that I have seen 
len ratingfive furthermore I absolutely have no idea why it has a star rating on this app store 
len ratingfive it should definitely have more considering the work and dedication Google has put Into this app 
len ratingfive the interface is very smooth and comfortable to me and every single webpage loads flawlessly 
len ratingfive if you are reading this I would definitely recommend chrome to you no matter what anybody says 
len ratingfive keep up the good work Google 
len ratingone Search is broken since the latest update 
len ratingone I can use the app to visit sites saved in my bookmarks but cannot search for anything 
len ratingone It will keep trying to load and then I get aw snap 
len ratingone I have deleted and re installed the app nothing helps 
len ratingfive Just found out that Chrome supports my password manager 
len ratingfive It s a few steps but it still supports it 
len ratingfive Definitely my favorite browser of the bunch 
len ratingfive I just wish we could develop our own extensions like we can on the desktop version of Chrome 
len ratingfive  To access rd Party Password Managers from Chrome for iOS While you are on the web site with the login password fields Tap Chrome dot menu and tap the box with up arrow A list of available app extensions should come up if you don t s
len ratingfive It s so funny that Apple fans are rating this app negatively because of control yet they are in the most controlled ecosystem possible lol 
len ratingfive Naive sheep 
len ratingfive App works great 
len ratingone browsing the plex web page no longer works for my local servers 
len ratingone This app is now unstable and unsafe 
len ratingone Customer support is very poor 
len ratingone Extensions cannot be added and malware can t be downloaded that specifically sweeps the app 
len ratingone The replies to customer complains are generic and condescending 
len ratingone Fix it and be done with it 
len ratingone It takes too long to download
len ratingfour  word 
len ratingthree My main complaint is the bar navigation Having to reach all the way up all the time especially when I want to share something is a real pain on something like the iPhone Plus Safari does this much easier and not to mention the share functionality is just one press away 
len ratingthree Other than that I love my bookmarks history tab from all my computer sync with my phone this is because I use Google Chrome on all my devices 
len ratingthree Except for my phone where I have to constantly switch between easy navigation and butter smooth UI safari and functionality chrome 
len ratingfive Old 
len ratingone Please fix I have deleted and reinstalled the app at least times without any change 
len ratingone It still doesn t open or work in any way 
len ratingone  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingone On YouTube you can t fullscreen pause or fast forward a video 
len ratingone Please fix this immediately thanks

len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingfour Finally the issue with the latest update was fixed Thanks We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingfour If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingone Since the most recent update my app will no longer open 
len ratingone I ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling also turning the device on and off 
len ratingone I m kind of upset since I use this instead of safari Edit I ve been continuously uninstalling and then downloading the app again daily since the th where the update stopped my app from working 
len ratingone No luck thus far 
len ratingone From the reviews it seems other people are having the same issue 
len ratingone  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingone Chrome for iPhone and iPad are terrible 
len ratingone Seems every time I use it it crashes 
len ratingone Even multiple times 
len ratingone Usually when doing a Search this image 
len ratingone Come on guys fix this darn thing for good 
len ratingone Won t play some YouTube videos that work fine in other browsers selling information 
len ratingone Blah Blah 
len ratingone Use something else people 
len ratingone I don t like a company that is so big they think they can control the population by manipulation 
len ratingone Tired of google censorship of conservative views and the only way to show them who is boss is to stop using them and stop buying any of their products 
len ratingthree Google chrome isn t that bad but if had a penny every time it would lag or crash I would probably be a millionaire 
len ratingthree Okay so there s been a glitch that s a bit annoying but easily solved 
len ratingthree Whenever I search up something and try to go watch a video on YouTube it won t let me but I fixed it by actually going to YouTube 
len ratingthree And that s it 
len ratingthree While it might be laggy in some areas it s good for looking up stuff finding locations etc 
len ratingthree Thank you for reading this 
len ratingthree Bye 
len ratingfive  QR 
len ratingfive It loads fast
len ratingone  Imagine we are already using incognito we clear history remove everything in advance setting website and we started using other search engine for sensitive personal stuff but still Chrome and Google were able to track us 
len ratingone They even know what image or link we saved etc 
len ratingone Google and its products cannot be trusted for our privacy 
len ratingone They are selling at our expense 
len ratingone We are appalled by this 
len ratingone It s insane 
len ratingone Looking for a compatible browser for iPad but ever since the update Chrome along with the built in Safari app are now very frustrating to use 
len ratingone If you dont update the app when a new one comes out it reverts you back to an ugly ad filled and impossible to use garbage chrome 
len ratingone No longer using chrome
len ratingfive App Works Great 
len ratingfive But I have one problem ad pop ups are annoying or let us customize our home page 
len ratingfive ADD EXTENSIONS JUST LIKE ON DESKTOP 
len ratingfive THANK YOU 
len ratingthree Web m support 
len ratingone Used to be great and easy to switch between users Now it s impossible 
len ratingone They destroyed the great multi user control it once had 
len ratingone When you switch to UserB it reverts to UserA in the middle of using it 
len ratingone Forget trying to switch to a desktop site or switch between voice vs gmail vs youtube etc 
len ratingone It just randomly changes back to the wrong user 
len ratingone The settings control pulls up settings for the wrong user then syncs to a totally different user mixing up all the data 
len ratingone Useless 
len ratingone This version is Completely inoperable between accounts Takes upwards of minutes to do what previously took click 
len ratingtwo When you can t get google owned YouTube to work on google owned Chrome it should be an embarrassment to Google 
len ratingtwo But hey we all know the company s track record on product QA 
len ratingone Seriously I like the functionality but hate getting spam ads and pop ups on my phone 
len ratingone One would think in pop ups wouldn t be a problem especially in mobile yet here we are 
len ratingthree Last update broke chrome 
len ratingthree You have to uninstall and reinstall it then all works well
len ratingfour The mobile interface for YouTube in the chrome browser is just wrecked

len ratingone So now I can t be lazy and have to type words out fully and spell check them myself

len ratingone What happened to all the settings for Google Chrome for instance JAVASCRIPT 
len ratingone How the hell do I disable JavaScript 
len ratingone At one time the settings actually allowed one to control your browser settings now NOT SO MUCH 
len ratingone Maybe it is time to stop using Chrome since it has become such a controlled environment 
len ratingone I have looked high and low for an answer on how to disable JavaScript but have yet to find one answer as how to do so 
len ratingfive The parents should know better 
len ratingfive Kids no things can leak 
len ratingfive From one who knew 
len ratingfive Anom 
len ratingfive Dab
len ratingone You changed the format 
len ratingone I hate it 
len ratingone I can t view the websites URLs when I google stuff 
len ratingone What the heck good is that 
len ratingone I feel like it s an attempt to catch my eye with marketing 
len ratingone Cmon google 
len ratingfive  Aloha vpn 
len ratingone For example I now must use Brave or Safari or the YouTube app itself to see YouTube videos 
len ratingone In Chrome the wait circle of dots just sits and spins forever 
len ratingone Tracking and personal info collection by Google is WAY over the top 
len ratingone Used to be faster but it s now my slowest browser 
len ratingone Google is not going to rule the world as planned if they keep this up 
len ratingone Crashes way to much
len ratingone Recently became super slow especially when trying to watch YouTube videos 
len ratingone Fortunately Safari works better for now 
len ratingone No matter how many times I sign in to chrome on my iPad chrome won t sync with my PC 
len ratingone So no bookmarks or favs etc 
len ratingone I never use chrome on iPad because of this 
len ratingone You would think they would have fixed it by now 
len ratingone None of my kids or my husband are able to sync their accounts either 
len ratingone I keep downloading the app every few months to see if it will allow me to do it to no avail 
len ratingone When I google it lol lots of others have the same problem and it has been going on a long time with no solution offered or in sight 
len ratingone Guess I am going to just give up and stay with Safari 
len ratingone I loved this AP but now crashes all the time on iPad with latest update 
len ratingone So inconsistent I have to change my preference to open web pages with Safari 
len ratingone Disappointed since I like using the sync with my PC version 
len ratingone Maybe they will repair 
len ratingone So long for now 
len ratingone Google needs to quit censoring journalists and researchers who fight dangerous monopolies 
len ratingone I don t know what happened with this version but it has an insanely bad bug in which the tab will freeze and you have to completely restart the app or close and reopen the tab 
len ratingone It takes about or minutes for a tab to become like this but it invariably happens to every tab 
len ratingone No clue how this got past QA 
len ratingthree On my iPad Pro when I click on a link to open another tab Google News is my main offender and then close that tab to return to the primary page I find the first page frozen 
len ratingthree Only cure is to quite Chrome and relaunch 
len ratingone Buying a Note Apple has gone down the drain 
len ratingone No licensed browsers block any modern pop ups pop unders or embedded ads 
len ratingone This app like many others kowtows to Apple s totalitarian user policies and it shows 
len ratingone The only thing keeping me from using Chrome over Safari is that I still can t save gifs from Chrome 
len ratingone It works just fine with Safari 
len ratingone For now I ll just use it when I want to play the Dino game 
len ratingone Whenever I click on a link in chrome and get direct to the in app YouTube it never loads 
len ratingone I almost failed my test because of this 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone The app won t open and then it crashes 
len ratingone I ve deleted and redownloded it 
len ratingone When I try to put in my username it hangs up there and crashes again 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone I love this app and hate Safari 
len ratingthree YouTube won t even load anymore 
len ratingthree Besides that everything else is fine 
len ratingthree I ve used chrome on my phone for the past years and everything has been fine until the current update 
len ratingthree Now chrome has chronic crashing problems it doesn t load pages correctly and I constantly have to close and then reopen a tab in order for the page to not load in as a blank grey screen 
len ratingthree I don t know what you did Google but it s messed up the functionality of the entire browser 
len ratingtwo I m a big fan of Google Chrome for the desktop mostly due to its speed password management and extensions 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately the mobile version on iOS lacks the consistent UI and speed I have gotten accustomed to on the desktop 
len ratingtwo I even have Google search app and that loads pages way faster than this 
len ratingtwo For now I still have to rely on safari as my native mobile browser until chrome creates a consistent experience in the Apple ecosystem 
len ratingone I had some important tabs opened and the app keeps crashing and whenever it does all of my tabs are deleted and I can t restore them 
len ratingone Also I used to be able to exit the app and still have music play in the background but now even if I go to a different tab it stops playing 
len ratingone Also youtube has stopped working 
len ratingone It will never load 
len ratingone It s not an internet issue because if I use try it in safari it loads immediately 
len ratingfour  Chrome 
len ratingtwo I have my laptop and YouTube linked up with my google account 
len ratingtwo Oftentimes my password doesn t work and I m forced to make a new password 
len ratingtwo Upon doing this I can t use any of my previous passwords 
len ratingtwo I m getting really fed up with practically recreating a google account every time I magically get signed out 
len ratingone My chrome browser freezes on the last updates with the latest iOS on iPhone s 
len ratingone Also when try to use text to speach feature it only speaks the web address instead of speaking the highlighted text 
len ratingone Safari works perfectly 
len ratingone  Hi there could you provide us the websites that you found text to speech feature not work well 
len ratingone We re trying to reproduce it here 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingone Twice I have gone to different sites one was for a recipe the other researching hemoglobin and a pop up blocks all access to chrome and has no exit button 
len ratingone The pop up requires you to press an OK button to take you to another site 
len ratingone The only other way to get it to rid of it is to reinstall Chrome which I have done 
len ratingone It s not worth constantly reinstalling and losing all my search history and tabs 
len ratingone As a phone app I consider this a dangerous hole in Chrome s security 
len ratingone As a desktop browser I would highly recommend it but until this is fixed I can t give a good review for this app 
len ratingone They keep making using YouTube worse and worse on chrome 
len ratingone I think it might be because they want you to use their YouTube app but I really don t like it and it s better for my use to use chrome YouTube 
len ratingone If I leave a video on a playlist on but leave it in the brackground for a while it won t play anymore and I have to close the page and find the video again 
len ratingone It s really annoying 
len ratingone Previous Review YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE YOUTUBE ON AND CLOSE THE PHONE OR USE OTHER APPS AND NOW YOU CANT 
len ratingone  We re sorry you re facing this issue 
len ratingone Background playback is not available on mobile browsers without a YouTube Red membership 
len ratingone Please click here to learn more 
len ratingtwo I You and e says vefar for a second h 
len ratingtwo You c fr des
len ratingfour  G 
len ratingone That Google has monetized me and my eyeballs is not news 
len ratingone It s a reasonable exchange for providing the information locating service that they provide 
len ratingone However the value of this service consists in large part on the fair unbiased return of requested information 
len ratingone Blocking criminal items like child pornography and snuff films is also reasonable 
len ratingone Those are evidence and monitizing of statute crimes that physically and emotionally harm real people 
len ratingone I don t fault Google for blocking search results for such dark web sites 
len ratingone Now it seems Google has branched out into social justice warfare 
len ratingone Defining political views that are not illegal but are unpleasant to contemplate for the majority of Google employees as physically and emotionally harmful and then restricting or blocking access to them is an abuse of power 
len ratingone If Google were a government agency that behavior would be illegal and unconstitutional 
len ratingone If Google were declared a monopoly or a public utility then that behavior would also be illegal 
len ratingone Google is none of those three though it is nearly a monopoly 
len ratingone Thankfully other companies can access the internet backbone and develop their own search algorithms 
len ratingone I have removed Google and Chrome in favor of another search engine and other browsers 
len ratingone I ll keep YouTube for the channels I subscribe to that are not blocked 
len ratingone I along with a few thousand others send a buck a month to the channels that have been demonitized by Google YouTube 
len ratingone As soon as the too controversial channels find streaming services to host them I ll go there 
len ratingone I ll keep Google Maps though I m using Waze and Apple Maps when possible now 
len ratingone But I ll no longer make my tiny contribution to Google s cash cow search engine until the company realizes that suppression of political dissent is evil and stops doing it 
len ratingfive Who else downloads to beat their meat then deletes it am I right 
len ratingone Funny huh 
len ratingone Cause youtube is owned by Google 
len ratingone Had to just permanently uninstall from Ipad Air after a popup ad kept hijacking and disabling and freezing Chrome x 
len ratingone Only way to get rid of popup ad was to uninstall and reinstall
len ratingone changing out all my google junk 
len ratingone Default search engine duckduckgo New browser firefox
len ratingthree i realize google is an ad agency so my expectations are low 
len ratingthree but they are ruining the internet 
len ratingone Fix the sync function that is literally the only point of the app how f ing stupid can you people be
len ratingone Originally used chrome to check Facebook messages since I don t use any Facebook apps 
len ratingone Chrome no longer allows me to do this 
len ratingone Also google is no longer about technology and innovation but political and social agendas 
len ratingone I can t get away totally but there are better browsers that do what this won t 
len ratingthree  bing Google 
len ratingone  Keep it up 
len ratingone Down almost a share over the past month 
len ratingone If we all band together google will miss out on ad clicks and data collection 
len ratingone Certain websites will no longer load 
len ratingone YouTube won t load videos however it works fine in Safari 
len ratingone Some forum websites will not work 
len ratingone It will initially load then stop working 
len ratingone I ve used this app for years but this all started in the last few weeks causing me to use safari which I hate 
len ratingone And be a search engine instead of the PC police 
len ratingone Then maybe I could give this app a decent review 
len ratingfive This is actually a bad review 
len ratingfive Don t let the star rating fool you 
len ratingfive This app actually gets zero stars for I don t trust what this app is doing on my device I was accessing Facebook through Chrome when the social media platform started to take a long time doing something other than posting my comment 
len ratingfive I closed the tab shut down Chrome deleted the app and as an extra precaution restarted my device 
len ratingfive When I opened the App Store to reinstall Chrome the App Store insisted that it was already installed 
len ratingfive The OPEN button was displayed but nothing happens when I tap on it 
len ratingfive The Chrome App has been a poor guest on my device 
len ratingfive I don t know what it is doing hidden in the background but it is no longer welcome 
len ratingfive You blew your one chance 
len ratingfive You don t get a second 
len ratingfive  Chrome 
len ratingfive Chrome will render web pages that Safari cannot even handle 
len ratingfive It s faster better and all around the only app suitable for iPhone 
len ratingthree Well I use the app but it s useful 
len ratingthree But I have an issue for this app 
len ratingthree During when I remove anything that I ve searched in the search history it causes a null search glitch 
len ratingthree So I wanted you to fix the app by removing the null search glitch when I m trying to delete any searches in the search history 
len ratingtwo Has anyone else not been able to open it after the most recent iOS 
len ratingtwo I ll just get the opening logo but then the phone kind of freezes and I can t get back to my home screen until I use the side button 
len ratingtwo Or it ll just stop and take me to the home screen 
len ratingtwo Wondering if anyone else had this issue 
len ratingtwo Circle will just spin around
len ratingfour This is app is amazing but there are too many useless ads when trying to open other tabs 
len ratingtwo I really want to like this app 
len ratingtwo It s been my go to browser for about years now 
len ratingtwo And for the past two years it feels like the app has gotten worse every update 
len ratingtwo Now maybe it s just my phone being outdated now iPhone but it s recent enough that the issues I ve faced have been very annoying 
len ratingtwo I have used Chrome exclusively for a long time now so I can t really compare it to other apps or the default Safari but I have not been satisfied lately 
len ratingtwo It s possible it is the best option out there but it still could be a lot better 
len ratingtwo The issue I ve been facing the past few days that finally made me frustrated enough to leave a review was due to YouTube 
len ratingtwo I have the YouTube app but I like using Chrome to have multiple videos open in different tabs so I can cycle through them 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately YouTube hasn t been working well lately but ONLY has issues with Chrome 
len ratingtwo The issue that I m talking about is YouTube videos will simply not load not even the name 
len ratingtwo Sometimes if I m lucky I can get a video to work by force closing the app reopening it and then refreshing the page 
len ratingtwo And even then it s a chance 
len ratingtwo Just think about that 
len ratingtwo YouTube one of Google s biggest platforms not working on Google s web browser 
len ratingtwo That s not to say that Chrome is without its benefits 
len ratingtwo When you open a new tab it shows you the sites you visit most frequently which can be very convenient 
len ratingtwo I like the pull down to refresh feature as well as the swiping left and right at the top of the screen to change tabs 
len ratingtwo Tab management is what this app does best 
len ratingtwo Incognito mode is a nice perk too 
len ratingtwo Overall I would say that Chrome is a browser with great features but sometimes struggles with the web browser part of the app 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately that s a pretty major issue 
len ratingtwo Here s to hoping Google can work it out 
len ratingfive Chrome just gets it 
len ratingfive It has all the n cessities of a great mobile browser 
len ratingfive Best part is the cross platform functionality with my desktop 
len ratingtwo I recently updated this app after about years 
len ratingtwo Sad to say it hasn t improved much 
len ratingtwo The worst bug I m getting is where it ll be loading a page and my internet connection is fine but the loading will just freeze 
len ratingtwo And the circle spins forever 
len ratingtwo I have to restart my iPad s wifi connection and wait until it registers that there s no internet and THEN it ll load the page 
len ratingtwo Just plain restarting the app doesn t work 
len ratingtwo Pretty annoying since it happens pretty constantly if I m browsing for an hour I can expect it to freeze while loading a page about times per hour 
len ratingtwo Edited to add It does crash a LOT less than the version did so that s an improvement 
len ratingfive I love this app It s like YouTube except better because it has taps and all that cool stuff and I have an iPad Air and I started watching chrome but it s always loading in the loading screen when you tap on a videos I really hate it so can you please fix that 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive Have you ever wished you had a pc of computer 
len ratingfive Well this app is just like having a pc or computer 
len ratingfive It has google 
len ratingfive WHAT MORE DO U NEED THEN GOOGLE 
len ratingtwo The program renders web pages just fine 
len ratingtwo However since it doesn t sync with Google account data it s a poor solution for a multi platform browser 
len ratingtwo I may need to use Firefox if I wish to have a browser that syncs browsing data across all devices 
len ratingone Google has an ideological echo chamber and is currently demonotizing anyone who has a view that is counter to their radical social justice warrior narrative 
len ratingone Google is run by a cult 
len ratingone The cult of diversity 
len ratingfive Never have problems with it 
len ratingfive Always love that it just pop open and ready to go for a question in the search bar Or that I can type in one word and boom it pops up with exactly what I was looking for 
len ratingfive Love love love it 
len ratingfive Anytime someone needs to know something and I dont know it either I just say Google it Lol
len ratingfive Nice to be able to work on my pic and pickup where I left off in the browser on either my iPhone 
len ratingfive Or iPad 
len ratingfive Bookmark syncing is great 
len ratingthree  Vpn
len ratingfive I love Chrome 
len ratingfive It s my go to app 
len ratingfive Huge improvement over safari 
len ratingfive This app is amazing 
len ratingfive I would definitely recommend it to everyone 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingone Chrome is heavy on resources 
len ratingone Also google is sketchy and very fascist 
len ratingone I ve been using Brave now and it s a lot faster and more secure than chrome 
len ratingfive  Enjoy google fast dependable
len ratingfive Enjoy google fast dependable
len ratingfive Chrome is the best internet App
len ratingfive  nice
len ratingfive It s fine
len ratingfive Thanks

len ratingfive Right 
len ratingfive One star due to being political activists
len ratingthree Google Chrome search engine works much better than Safari however the auto fill feature does not work on my iPhone 
len ratingthree This can become very time consuming when having to login to several accounts needs to be improved 
len ratingone I ve had this app for nearly years however I m about to delete it because they feel they should decide what people are allowed to see
len ratingfive Muy buena
len ratingfive By far
len ratingfive  google 
len ratingfive  D
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingfive Google does it all 
len ratingfive I thought Google was great when it first came out as a search engine 
len ratingfive Just keeps getting better 
len ratingone This has a major problem that s been going on as long as I can remember incognito mode being around 
len ratingone It has a nasty habit of caching images to display when you are switching between apps 
len ratingone For some stupid unknowable reason it always caches whatever you ve looked up on incognito mode and for the next month you live in fear of the possibility that you ll double click the home button to swap apps and some cached image from your past will haunt you 
len ratingone It s a major violation of privacy and completely defeats the purpose of incognito mode 
len ratingone I ve tried clearing all cached images etc but it doesn t help 
len ratingone I think the bug has more specifically to do with caching images when you turn the phone sideways 
len ratingone I typically only see it pop up if I double click the home button from an app that only operates sideways 
len ratingone Anyways fix this 
len ratingone It s obnoxious 
len ratingone I won t be using the app until it s corrected 
len ratingfour It functions as it needs to but there are still small glitches sometimes
len ratingfive Google you probably gathered all the data you want from me about me but you have given me a great browser 
len ratingthree Fast browser syncs well with devices but reader view is the only thing holding it back from safari
len ratingfive I love it so much 
len ratingthree See subject line just like safari 
len ratingthree One thing they do better 
len ratingfour I like using Google very much Far surpasses Safari however somethings like auto fill just don t work and they should 
len ratingfour Come on Google do a little better job and you will have the perfect product
len ratingfive Safari and IE are straight trash 
len ratingfive Always have been
len ratingfive I am a huge Google Chrome fan 
len ratingfive I use it on my macbook and my iphone 
len ratingfive Always quality 
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfive vary good
len ratingfive Definitely the most used app that I have
len ratingfive It s my go to internet app runs smoothly and I haven t had a problem 
len ratingfive Been using for years now and never any issues unlike Microsoft Exploder 
len ratingfive Whether for business or personal Chrome is life 
len ratingfive Easily sharing and navigating on desktop or mobile mashed my life easier 
len ratingfive Keep improving keep Googling
len ratingfive Enough said 
len ratingfour It is better than safari and all the other internet apps 
len ratingfive The only web browser that works for me
len ratingfour I don t think there is any competition for chrome 
len ratingfive Fast simple and reliable 
len ratingfive A better auto fill of passwords would help but this is a killer product already 
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingfive Simple 
len ratingfive Best app ever
len ratingfive Even though I use an iPhone I use Chrome because it s such a better experience 
len ratingfive I love how chrome syncs across all my devices 
len ratingfive I d like to address the bad reviews based on the employee fired for his incendiary email 
len ratingfive As a woman in the tech industry I applaud Google for standing up against misogyny 
len ratingfive Hopefully one day we won t have to deal with people like this 
len ratingfive Firefox is pretty good too 
len ratingone  Why doesn t auto correct work in the search fields 
len ratingone Leaving their ecosystem entirely 
len ratingone Who controls the past controls the present 
len ratingone Who controls the present controls the future 
len ratingone Google i mean goolag is a terrible sexist racist totalitarian company 
len ratingone Deleting google apps as they feel need to suppress opinions 
len ratingone If they will do so in a very obvious manner by firing employees what will they do in the unconscious biases by what they return in search results 
len ratingone So tired of the elitist feeling it is their need to control the behavior of others 
len ratingtwo Whenever I listen to music it becomes impossible to listen to it in the background even though I could before 
len ratingtwo I would like that feature back in the next update thanks 
len ratingfive THE DINOSAUR GAME OP AF
len ratingfive Compared to Safari this is so much faster and more compatible with more of the Internet that the choice is obvious 
len ratingfive Sure there are areas to improve her overall compared to the rest it is head and shoulders above 
len ratingone Company that only hires social justice warriors and silenced those who call them out deserves bankruptcy 
len ratingone Uninstalled
len ratingfive Let agree we can
len ratingthree Google is a better search engine than safari but if you plan on doing anything else like streaming video it s super unstable so Oman for it to crash multiple times
len ratingone To hell with the New World Order to hell with Big Brother and to hell with you 
len ratingone This monopoly of a company hates free speech and diversity of opinions 
len ratingone These are anti intellectual people who suppress thoughts 
len ratingone Google Fascists 
len ratingone Crashes all the time even with iPhone s this is absolutely ridiculous 
len ratingone I can t even find as many results as I could with something like duck duck go
len ratingone I ve used Chrome for a while but I finally realized that Chrome only shows google search results that are manicured to what they WANT you to find not necessarily what you re looking for 
len ratingone Always remember that when a product is free you ARE the product 
len ratingone  will not download again 
len ratingone Use Brave instead 
len ratingone Leaving for a more diverse browser 
len ratingone I only use google chrome on my iPhone when I don t want to close out the OG GOOGLE APP 
len ratingone And let your employees speak freely this is not North kcrapea or the Soviet Goonion 
len ratingone USA 
len ratingthree It was great until it disappeared and didn t let me install again
len ratingone It seems like such a small detail but not having these usernames and passwords auto populate absolutely kills my experience 
len ratingone I have so many different passwords for so many different logins that I rely on Chrome remembering these things for me to use my different sites and accounts and yet I cannot get this to work 
len ratingone Chrome settings say it s supposed to be working but it just refuses to 
len ratingone Very very frustrating issue 
len ratingone I have to stop and go to the Passwords manager and manually look up there s no included search function every user name and password every time I use those sites 
len ratingone There s no issue on my work desktop or my personal computer but on the road on my iPad it s useless 
len ratingone Chrome is useless to me on iPad 
len ratingone Uninstalling and using Safari instead 
len ratingone The idiots at this company care nothing for ideological diversity 
len ratingone Seems they like to hire Tumblr feminists and anti fact driven concept emotional response followers instead of hiring people for their skills 
len ratingone After last update app will not open or be deleted 
len ratingone It just says waiting no matter what I do 
len ratingone  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingone Can t be used 
len ratingone Every time I open the app I get message that the last time I closed it it crashed 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingone  We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingfive iPad arrived as promised and in good shape 
len ratingfive As a surprise I also received a power station 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive  iPhone 
len ratingone No need to beat the dead horse but really Google 
len ratingone I thought you were different
len ratingone So employees can t even express their opinions at Google anymore and still be employed there 
len ratingone Cult like for sure 
len ratingtwo I cannot select any options from the chrome menu in the app on my iPhone s with IOS 
len ratingtwo This has been the case for the past several updates 
len ratingtwo It includes the report issue item so I cannot report the problem from the app 
len ratingone Hard to use a solution whose purpose is to bring a knowledge to its customers when a thoughtful employee was fired for expressing reasonable views 
len ratingfive Great work 
len ratingfive This is much better than any other browser 
len ratingfive Super like 
len ratingfive Highly recommend it works perfect with the SE 
len ratingone I hope James Damore sues the life out your corp 
len ratingone Disgusting the way you responded simply disgusting 
len ratingone  Research google memo switching to bing
len ratingone With corrupted results
len ratingtwo Used to love the ole goog but chrome isba ram hog for all platforms 
len ratingtwo Im breaking up with google Hello bing and cortana
len ratingone Enjejejrishdejeisbehdijseb
len ratingone New version won t open Freezes Have tried multiple installs We re sorry that you are facing this issue 
len ratingone If Chrome fails to launch after an upgrade please delete the Chrome app and download it again from App Store 
len ratingfour I think chrome is awesome it has an awesome sync between computers laptops phones and tablets it s fast and friendly very easy to use but the only thing that bugs me is how they don t have a night mode every other browser has one even the not so popular ones and I m sure that s why I a lot of people use other browsers in for the night mode 
len ratingfour White screens strain the eye which is why even apple has the night time orangish color for us to customize 
len ratingfour But for a browser that claims to be the best and has worldwide users they really need to consider the health of their consumers but it s still a great browser no doubt 
len ratingfour Just that one flaw 
len ratingone Terrible app 
len ratingone Terrible company 
len ratingone  thought police
len ratingone Completely bug ridden and slow 
len ratingone Also skews my search results with false info 
len ratingone WOULD RECCOMEND DIFFERENT BROWSER
len ratingtwo Crashes 
len ratingtwo Constantly 
len ratingtwo Locks up 
len ratingtwo Hope the July update helps 
len ratingtwo Google could and should do so much better 
len ratingtwo We have this amazing technology being throttled by lousy software 
len ratingtwo Apple IOS included in that sentiment 
len ratingfive  iPad 
len ratingfive Great app with equally great interface 
len ratingone This app is atrocious in terms of the amount of battery it consumes 
len ratingone If you dont believe me do yourself a favor and leave the app on for hours then check your battery usage for the last hours 
len ratingone I guarantee you that even when it s simply on in the background this app alone will use upwards of of your battery life 
len ratingtwo The things I do are just easier and faster in safari 
len ratingtwo The final straw was when all my already clicked links went back to blue 
len ratingtwo I use google for everything even my phone over safari 
len ratingtwo However recently google has been freezing up in my app and laptop from just highlighting to copy clicking on links to scrolling down or up 
len ratingtwo Really a huge pain cause I can only close google down to get out of it 
len ratingtwo Ya can t hit the back button refresh page open another page 
len ratingtwo This last time which was yesterday I waited longer than minutes before returning to google and it was still froze so I removed the app and am going to reinstall until the next freeze 
len ratingtwo Google please fix this problem I don t like safari 
len ratingone There are too many pop up pop under pop over pop through ads that make viewing nearly any page impossible 
len ratingfive  Chrome Android 
len ratingfive  i love u
len ratingtwo App blacks out with no recovery outside of force closing 
len ratingtwo Swap back to Firefox to a bit until they figure this one out 
len ratingtwo  The app has started having problems rendering and the Awww Snap page errors mercurynews com seems to be a particular offender 
len ratingone Im leaving you for Bing 
len ratingone Chrome is eating my battery now 
len ratingone It is laggy when I use it and battery stats say it is of battery usage when most other apps are at 
len ratingone Switching back to safari 
len ratingone Very slow and unresponsive 
len ratingone Crashes constantly 
len ratingone Getting that grey screen of death GSOD 
len ratingone What happened here 
len ratingfive I ve never had a problem with this app in the five years I ve been using it 
len ratingfive It works perfectly 
len ratingfive One thing I love is that you can open a link in a new tab but it won t force you to go to the new tab it let s you stay on the main page 
len ratingfive It s also really easy to navigate and you can access bookmarks from your computer on your mobile device and vice versa 
len ratingfive It also just looks much better than the default Safari app on iPhones 
len ratingfive I wish I could delete Safari and only have Chrome because it s honestly the best 
len ratingone after i updated the app it doesn t open when i tap to open it
len ratingone When will we be able to cast from Google Chrome to Chromecast devices 
len ratingtwo Latest update shows options for new tab history etc 
len ratingtwo but will not open said options 
len ratingtwo Uninstalling and reinstalling app does not change accessibility 
len ratingtwo This has been driving me crazy through multiple updates 
len ratingtwo Forum pages will not load properly on the mobile chrome browser 
len ratingtwo Sometimes they will load on a second or third attempt but hitting the back button will bring you back pages ugh
len ratingfive  Google vpn
len ratingfive About time 
len ratingtwo No internet error but safari works fine 
len ratingtwo Freezes when scrolling on page 
len ratingtwo Again safari and Firefox fine 
len ratingone This app used to be great until recently 
len ratingone It has started to freeze while viewing pages randomly crash and when having multiple tabs open it will just show me a grey page when I try to look at a previous tab 
len ratingone I first thought it was my phone but no other apps would have any problems when it freezes and the iOS will also work fine 
len ratingone I ve tried rebooting phone cleared cache and reinstalled app 
len ratingone This has gone on only for a couple weeks and I was hoping google would fix it by now 
len ratingfour So they finally fixed the tab issue 
len ratingfour For those unaware in the past swiping the edge of the screen allowed you to change your current tabs 
len ratingfour That was altered some time back so instead it went to the previous or next webpage visited 
len ratingfour It turns out the tab issue was resolved a while back you have to swipe on the address bar 
len ratingfour I m happy but I just wish Google had informed up about the change instead of sliding it under the carpet 
len ratingthree It s ok 
len ratingfour My Find in Page seems to be broken
len ratingfive Good
len ratingthree It s not too shabby I d use it more but I can t because I need two different browsers to be able to use my business and private accounts separately 
len ratingthree I have bookmarks and accounts logged into set up separately for business and private on superset google accounts it would be great to be able to have multiple users on multiple tabs like on the desktop version 
len ratingthree Please add multi user support like you have on Mac OS and windows 
len ratingone Chromes been awful the past few days 
len ratingone Losing connections and crashing 
len ratingone Time to delete
len ratingthree This app drains my battery like crazy

len ratingfive  pear else JS dear disk apple
len ratingone I was looking at chrome and I got a bad virus and I don t know what to do so I deleted the app 
len ratingone Cannot use the current version of the app at all 
len ratingone I tried to open several times with various combinations of in reinstalling opening and closing to no avail 
len ratingone Just opens and stays on the home screen and will eventually crash 
len ratingone Hoping a new update comes out soon that will address this b c I love this app when it works 
len ratingone Every website loads and works fine 
len ratingone Google anything doesn t work on this app 
len ratingone What s up with that 
len ratingone This only started recently 
len ratingone I can no longer google stuff using this app 
len ratingone  I prefer using the desktop version of Reddit on my phone 
len ratingone This latest update made it so that pressing certain buttons on Reddit don t work 
len ratingone Can t upvote or downvote can t reply to comments 
len ratingone It s all kinds of jacked up 
len ratingone Going back to Safari until it s fixed 
len ratingone Avoid 
len ratingone App Freeze When Selecting Text 
len ratingone When you highlight text QP freezes 
len ratingone So crazy that it can t handle this simple task 
len ratingone Why even have text highlight if it freezes the app 
len ratingone Go to website begin to select text frozen crash app start again 
len ratingone Have to do this times just to select a section so I can Speak the text 
len ratingone We re not talking about highlighting War and Peace I m talking about selecting a phone number 
len ratingone New update zero change 
len ratingone  Google coders please help 
len ratingone  Or maybe management is pushing a product out that s half baked 
len ratingone Using s and newest IOS 
len ratingone  Aw Snap 
len ratingone Another workflow disrupted 
len ratingone Aw Snap 
len ratingone Another video restarted 
len ratingone Aw Snap 
len ratingone Another page failed to load 
len ratingone Aw Snap 
len ratingone I guess I ll have to go back to Safari 
len ratingone Your desktop product is pretty good but the disruptive errors in the iOS app have grown more frequently with every update now almost any page I try to browse I have to reload multiple times 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome 
len ratingone You used to be a solid app 
len ratingone Aw Snap 
len ratingfour Seems to be intermittent but every now and then possibly after updates not sure always update all at the same time completion starts working only for the first word 
len ratingfour Kind of frustrating since I ve become so used to using it 
len ratingfour Otherwise a very good app 
len ratingfive I would like to be able to go into full screen when viewing an image 
len ratingone Freezes then crashes after opening after last update
len ratingthree Needs extensions and home button despite what chrome and Google have done to avoid ads they are still way too invasive on every site to patiently use this browser I love Chrome on the desktop because of its extensions 
len ratingthree I don t see any reason other than maybe Apple restricting it to have good extensions also please make a home button I know it can t be that hard thank you 
len ratingfive Hgfhh
len ratingfive GREAT FOR SEARCHING
len ratingone It says this site can not be reached when I look something up
len ratingthree It s good enough I m sure with he ungodly amounts of money you all make you could do better 
len ratingone The app is unusable after the most recent update 
len ratingtwo I like chrome in general and I like the way I can organize bookmarks 
len ratingtwo But the thing keeps choking on web pages with the Aw Snap error 
len ratingtwo Really frustrating 
len ratingtwo I want to use Chrome and in some cases I need to use Chrome because so much of my data belongs in the Google ecosystem 
len ratingtwo However when browsing I will occasionally run into the you have won a special Google contest full app takeover or your phone has a virus 
len ratingtwo There seems to be no way out of this 
len ratingtwo And this happens on normal regular websites while trying to access stories and news 
len ratingtwo There is no way to back out 
len ratingtwo The only option I ve run into is to uninstall Chrome and start over from scratch 
len ratingtwo Google you can t stop this 
len ratingtwo A less reputable advertiser or scammer has the ability to render your browser unusable 
len ratingtwo This happened as an Android user and now an iPhone user 
len ratingtwo Not acceptable 
len ratingfive This is a really useful browser and it works perfectly when using it 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive  stars Though I have some suggestions Maybe when your on a page you can save it on to your home screen like on Safari 
len ratingfive And I know it s already a restriction but it would be nice to make Google Chrome your default browser 
len ratingfive Chrome is a lot easier to use if your transferred from an app to a page on the internet to enter some sign up stuff or to enter an email 
len ratingfive Anyway overall it s a great app to use 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work 
len ratingone  Who told you guys to put Close All Incognito Tabs under New Incognito Tabs in the menu 
len ratingone A misoperation and BOOM 
len ratingone My tabs vanished with no ways to recover 
len ratingone A destructive operation without an undo option 
len ratingone Ridiculous 
len ratingone  MMP 
len ratingone I d rather stick my finger in a toaster than use this browser in support of Google who supports illegally spying on U S citizens 
len ratingone Issue of scrolling down freezes and shuts down not enough updates 
len ratingone Please try and work on it 
len ratingone Google chrome should be better than safari which is not unfortunately 
len ratingfive Jp
len ratingone Can no longer save bookmarks 
len ratingthree I cant search bookmarked pages because it doesn t have search box where I can just type in the title 
len ratingthree I bookmarked a lot of pages and when I try to search one of the bookmarked page I have to go through list of all the bookmarks to find it 
len ratingthree It takes way too much time 
len ratingthree Android chrome app had feature allowing me to just type in title or phrase and filter bookmarks but apparently chrome app for iphone doesn t have that feature
len ratingfour  There should be an option to show the bookmark bar on an iPad 
len ratingfour The screen is big enough and I m sure I m not the only one who would use it like crazy 
len ratingfour Please consider 
len ratingtwo nd time chrome crashed on me and deleted all my open tabs 
len ratingtwo Very annoying 
len ratingfive Why Costco s price is higher than store 
len ratingone The most recent update keeps crashing 
len ratingone What am I doing wrong 
len ratingfour The autofill password feature is not working 
len ratingone New update disabled everything even options of choosing online when tapping on icons won t work or even let s you choose Fix this Bug 
len ratingone I can t watch YouTube videos on the desktop version of Chrome 
len ratingone You own YouTube 
len ratingone I know what you re trying to do to get me to download your very stupid Youtube app 
len ratingone However I LIKE the Chrome desktop version 
len ratingone Now every time I click a video the screen goes black and the video doesn t load 
len ratingone But Google probably already knew that 
len ratingone Well guess I ll just go back to Safari 
len ratingone Oh and if the developer responds with some garbage about a Red account remember all the complaints here are from the same thing 
len ratingone Keep your red account as I watch my videos on Safari 
len ratingfour I really don t like the new version only because the search feature is very different than before 
len ratingfive  VPN 
len ratingone i would give stars it was possible 
len ratingone I cannot scroll to the top of the page that the page reloading 
len ratingone Unbelievably annoying
len ratingfive This is the best website for EditMyCookie 
len ratingfive I can be Guest on ROBLOX 
len ratingfive Thanks Google Chrome 
len ratingone You realize chrome is a mess on the iPhone 
len ratingone Freezes from the opening screen
len ratingtwo Never have I been plagued with pop ups on Chrime until the last month or so 
len ratingtwo Now apparently my iPad is the lucky th visitor to some site or another and if I clock ok no other option listed by the way I will qualify for a new iPhone s 
len ratingtwo I wonder if my digital footprint is somehow labeled STUPID 
len ratingtwo I d have to be to fall for that 
len ratingtwo Today is the third time in a month I ve had to shut everything down to clear the screen 
len ratingtwo Since not even that worked today I actually removed the app and am getting ready to reinstall 
len ratingtwo Please add some extra security so this stops happening 
len ratingfive Used it to replace safari
len ratingone  TMD 
len ratingtwo Unfortunately this app crashes far too often for me 
len ratingtwo With ios now allowing content blocking the lack of the feature is a serious negative in a browser 
len ratingone  For months every time I try to bookmark a page from Chrome in my iPhone it supposedly sends it to a fictitious folder called Want to take Better Pictures with your iPhone 
len ratingone I have yet to find this folder and the bookmark cannot be found anywhere 
len ratingone I have no problems saving a bookmark on my iPad or any other computer mac or Windows based 
len ratingone Can t load pages particularly Google News 
len ratingone And Google 
len ratingone It just seems to work when it feels like it 
len ratingone Sad 
len ratingone Smooth rendering 
len ratingone But I think the design team tried too hard to make the browser feels different than safari that makes everything wrong 
len ratingone Feels counter intuitive
len ratingone They have tooking over dollars from me never able to access my accout again would never recommend google
len ratingtwo I m not sure but the new update might be the cause of my iPhone almost dying 
len ratingtwo Once I removed it phone is back 
len ratingtwo Installed again crashed again 
len ratingtwo Finally got back in and deleted the app 
len ratingtwo I hope you are fixing this 
len ratingtwo I like the app 
len ratingfour  I don t have a problem except for thing 
len ratingfour I m wondering when Chrome Web Store will be released for mobile 
len ratingfour If it s taking a while I m sure it s gonna be a big update and it ll be awesome 
len ratingtwo Ever since the new update chrome has been freezing and crashing frequently 
len ratingtwo At first it was mainly when I was on FB but now it s pretty much every site 
len ratingone I ve had to delete and re download several times and now I m just done 
len ratingone App won t work unreliable and a general nuisance now 
len ratingone Used to love it but now it s literally a buggy app
len ratingone Every time I try to use this app a pop up comes up claiming to offer me a free iPhone and I do not know how to get rid of this 
len ratingtwo I love the app over Safari when it s working 
len ratingtwo It crashes at times 
len ratingtwo And currently it s unresponsive 
len ratingtwo It froze up yesterday 
len ratingtwo I uninstalled and reinstalled but when I go through the initial set up it freezes on the page where it asks me to sign into my account 
len ratingfour I like Chrome and I only recently switched from Safari so a lot of my issues are me getting used to a new interface BUT I am experiencing issues trying to go back a page 
len ratingfour I swipe right to get to the previous page and it just keeps on the current page with a URL change then if I try one more swipe it takes me to a page three pages before 
len ratingfour Not really ideal but I like the product overall 
len ratingone  Google google 
len ratingone It won t allow me to get to common websites 
len ratingone It will stop me from going to Twitter by saying the site is not secure very annoying 
len ratingone Behuhuwad over mcclain 
len ratingfive serves its purpose although i would like the option of having the home button on chrome like i do on my samsung tablet
len ratingthree I didn t have any bad problems with this mobile version on google chrome 
len ratingthree However why are the option tabs at the top of the app 
len ratingthree That s inconvenient 
len ratingthree That makes the app a hassle to use 
len ratingthree I can t leisurely use this app without adjusting the phone in my hand or using two hands 
len ratingthree It s irksome 
len ratingthree I assume it s to mirror the desktop version but it s on a phone 
len ratingthree The tabs not being on the bottom doesn t make it unique it makes it awkward 
len ratingone  Eff this browser 
len ratingone Constantly having to refresh old tabs that were already opened when you just leave it for a minute to a different tab 
len ratingone When your writing an important email or text on a site and you have to switch tabs reply fast you can lose everything you wrote because of chromes new stupid update feature 
len ratingone This was never a problem before and now it s suppose to be a new feature to supposedly save you ram which is retarded 
len ratingone I m done using chrome until they fix this crap
len ratingtwo Google chrome was such a a good browser until they updated 
len ratingtwo Now It doesn t load certain web pages like it used to especially forum sites 
len ratingtwo Now I have to go back to safari 
len ratingtwo Unhappy customer
len ratingtwo I have an iPad with nothing running and seeing this message 
len ratingtwo Yea it not the blue screen of death but might as well be 
len ratingfour I love this app but I wish it supported dynamic text 
len ratingfour I have my text size increased on my phone but when I read on chrome everything is still small
len ratingthree I will say that I really enjoy using chrome because it is much better and faster to use 
len ratingthree I will also say that I like using it on every device except my iPad because every time I want to watch a video it crashes and I mean every single time 
len ratingthree I can t even use safari because for some reason there is an error which causes it to reload every seconds even if there isn t even a problem to begin with 
len ratingthree I would be very happy if they could maybe updated this app so that it wouldn t crash every time I try to use it 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingone I ve been trying to download it and its been saying this app can not be downloaded at this time thats what it says anytime i try downloading it
len ratingone Bring back the old search results layout 
len ratingone I hate this new one 
len ratingone The tones are way too soft and the website font for each search is way too small 
len ratingone Whoknew searching on google chrome would become so annoying 
len ratingfour When I visit a page it keeps saying I have no internet connection 
len ratingfour I check my bar but it shows five bars 
len ratingfour Is this some kind of malware 
len ratingfour We need bigger web pages font that choose in app 
len ratingfour Over ios options 
len ratingtwo This used to be my go to search engine 
len ratingtwo However it is still crashing like crazy 
len ratingtwo Needs a lot of work 
len ratingone I got this app because it was recommended for better quality on the iPhone to watch videos 
len ratingone I get it and whenever I try to search up something it either crashes or just keeps loading and loading forever 
len ratingone If it even does work it s so laggy it makes it crash AGAIN 
len ratingone This is terrible I don t know why this is recommended to ANYONE 
len ratingone It appears Uhaul wants you to spend your money on things you don t need or want 
len ratingone Items are pre checked in hopes you will pay for them 
len ratingone And good luck canceling anything 
len ratingone They make that really heard 
len ratingone  iOS version lacks settings functionality compared to Android version no cookie blocking and many others
len ratingone Slow glitchy inconvenient 
len ratingone Pages that won t load or display improperly on Chrome work fine in Safari 
len ratingthree  Although I usually do like the Chrome product I m curious why this app doesn t have a menu similar to other apps such as Inbox and Google Keep for easy switching between multiple user accounts 
len ratingthree Just an idea for improvement 
len ratingthree Have a great day 
len ratingthree Pros for current update Much smoother than pre installed Safari 
len ratingthree  Google is used constantly in my life so being able to only sign in once and access everything is convenient 
len ratingthree Cons for current update Slightly clunky interface which may not be intuitive for the vast majority of people 
len ratingthree  I dislike that tabs are lost often 
len ratingthree Suggestions I don t know about anyone else but I read light novels like a lab rat on methamphetamine so I desperately need a reading view tab like Safari 
len ratingthree Safari constantly caught viruses from ads randomly but Google has not failed me once so I decided to switch over 
len ratingthree Unfortunately there was no reading tab which made reading on clunky sites very annoying 
len ratingthree Hopefully you consider my suggestion so this humble one may be pleased by your graciousness 
len ratingone Ad block doesn t work fully 
len ratingone You re still going to get ad layovers and page lag randomly when using 
len ratingone The tab layout button is horrible with both settings 
len ratingone Can t believe google designed something so AOL like from 
len ratingfive I used to have a Samsung and chrome was really good on it and on the iPhone it is even better 
len ratingone Constantly get this on the mobile site I created 
len ratingone Safari is fine 
len ratingone Cleared cache uninstalled reinstalled same thing 
len ratingone Happened recently must be an update 
len ratingtwo When will we be able to have our add one here 
len ratingtwo I can t do any of my work on my iPad easily without some of my Chrome extensions 
len ratingfive  app 
len ratingtwo Since the latest update Crome freezes there doesn t seem to be a pattern and so far the only way I have found to fix it is a complete restart 
len ratingtwo UPDATE since the download of the latest version the crashing and freezing has gotten worse 
len ratingtwo There are times that only restarting my IPad fixes it 
len ratingtwo All tabs disappear and I have to reset them 
len ratingtwo On FB while scrolling down all the post disappear and I am left with a blank screen 
len ratingtwo  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingtwo Please update your Google Chrome and it should now be working as usual
len ratingfive  PC TM 
len ratingthree For some reason now I can no longer scroll down to the Next button at the bottom of search results on my iPhone SE 
len ratingthree I can see it when I drag as far down as possible but it then bounces back up again where I can no longer access and tap it 
len ratingthree So I can only see the first page of results and no more 
len ratingtwo Each new update somehow brings about more pop ups that automatically open the App Store 
len ratingtwo The sites I go to are pretty benign 
len ratingtwo I m slowly being forced to stop using this app 
len ratingtwo If other google apps force me to use chrome then it really needs Reader Mode 
len ratingtwo It won t open in safari so I have to copy paste the URL it s wasting a lot of time for what all other browsers can do right now 
len ratingtwo I don t want to find out if the app is any good for anything else because it s unusable now 
len ratingfive  ipad Safari Google 
len ratingone It freezes up regularly then crashes 
len ratingone Also if you put more than a couple words into the search bar then want to modify what you searched for you can only edit the last couple words otherwise you have to erase everything and start over 
len ratingone Safari let s you scroll left if you hold the cursor left but google makes you retype everything 
len ratingone Love google but hate this app 
len ratingtwo I m reading pages with simple text and the browser crashes on me 
len ratingtwo Seems to be happening a lot to me lately 
len ratingone Updated the app but it kept failing to update so I deleted it and redownloaded the app and now it fails to open 
len ratingone Guess I ll stick with Safari 
len ratingone I have Mbps internet and I constantly find myself waiting a good seconds to refresh something like facebook when it used to be done in a second 
len ratingtwo It s 
len ratingtwo Been so many weeks 
len ratingtwo It doesn t sync the passwords fast 
len ratingtwo Though I have the updated app
len ratingone Don t install you search for anything you have ads on the bottom of the page and pop ups i opt out of ads from google did not fix the problem deleted app
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingfive I used it for many years 
len ratingfive I love Chrome when I need to look up stuff or find things I never have a problem of finding what I want in a matter of time 
len ratingthree  mac 
len ratingtwo It would be really great to have a reading mode in Chrome 
len ratingone Lately when I click on a page it opens adds to other pages or gives me alerts that I can t close out of 
len ratingone Better to just stick with safari 
len ratingtwo Ever since I updated my bookmarks keep getting deleted 
len ratingtwo I added all my bookmarks back last night and when I checked today they were all gone again 
len ratingtwo Some of them are hard to track down pages and it s really frustrating having to find them all over and over again 
len ratingfour This used to be the best browser for mobile devices 
len ratingfour Don t get me wrong it s still in the top but it seems to be having some buggy issues that will hopefully be corrected via updates 
len ratingone I don t use Facebook or any other similar app 
len ratingone While navigating in Chrome I must ve clicked on a Facebook icon 
len ratingone Then I couldn t get out of the log in page 
len ratingone Closing and opening the app puts me back in the same page I was stuck in 
len ratingone So I deleted Chrome altogether 
len ratingone I was using this app all the time but recently I started noticing my phone overheating while the app is in use 
len ratingone Be careful until Google corrects the overheating issue I would not recommend
len ratingfive It s my go to browser for all devices 
len ratingfive The seamless cross device experience coupled with speed and reliability will keep me using Chrome as my default browser 
len ratingfour  mobi 
len ratingtwo Just yesterday I m trying to watch a video on the full screen and the video doesn t support full screen because the browser version isn t updated even though the software has been updated 
len ratingtwo Chrome Google please update browser version on IPad and iPhone 
len ratingfive  PC chrome 
len ratingfive It is grate
len ratingfive Its always my first 
len ratingfive Choice thx googs
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingfive I ve never ever used safari
len ratingfive My favorite browser 
len ratingfive So convenient and simple 
len ratingone In the last update youtube app doesn t open its videos from chrome 
len ratingone When I checked the in apps I didn t find YouTube 
len ratingfive I love this app because I can access it anywhere I go 
len ratingfive I m in school now and I can access the desk top version on my phone I say google app is the app to have 
len ratingfive And yes it is better than safari MSN and all the rest of the apps out there 
len ratingfive Fast reliable built in translate 
len ratingfive There s no better option on iOS 
len ratingone  clear data don t work crashing after launch
len ratingthree  All good can t understand why does not support reading mode feature similar to Safari or Mozilla 
len ratingfive Better than the stock safari browser 
len ratingfive Can t beat Chrome 
len ratingfive Yes I like it
len ratingfive It s great I love it 
len ratingfive I love this app it s one of the best
len ratingfour Easy to use and loads better than the Google App which it tends to overlap with functionally 
len ratingfive I find this app so much better then Safari 
len ratingfive It s easy to use and helps me find anything I need within seconds 
len ratingfive  Google is worth my supporting for a decade 
len ratingfour Superb 
len ratingfour A few hiccups but those are easy to overlook because this outdoes the alternative safari 
len ratingfive Does the job well
len ratingfive So easy to use a must for using the Internet 
len ratingfive very good
len ratingfive I love Google Chrome 
len ratingfive Annie Mautner
len ratingfive Love using Chrome 
len ratingfive Great browser from Google so it keeps all your google apps together 
len ratingfive Been using Chrome on the phone for a few years now 
len ratingfive It s great and fast and handles tabs well 
len ratingfour Google Chrome s malleability and reliability is what makes it so superb 
len ratingfour I wish there was a way Chrome could be programmed as my default browser on my iPhone but that s probably wishful thinking 
len ratingfour My hope is that the browser becomes more user friendly for those of whom are less savvy than others 
len ratingfour Otherwise a excellent iOS version of the best internet browser 
len ratingfive  iPhone Windows MacBook Chrome 
len ratingfive Only browser I use 
len ratingfive It s fast 
len ratingfive It works 
len ratingfive No issues 
len ratingfour Just wish Chrome worked on more sites that are setup with I E 
len ratingfour That s a war I can not stop 
len ratingfour Chrome is so much easier to use than other apps 
len ratingfive I like it
len ratingfive  google 
len ratingfive  Used it for many years good sync feature 
len ratingfive This is a helpful app easy to use and very quick service 
len ratingfive  iOS 
len ratingthree On both my iPhone and iPad I cannot use the following website since the last update 
len ratingthree Before that I was able to access the site 
len ratingthree It is the school management system we use and I was using just fine before 
len ratingthree Now I get a message that says I have an incompatible software version 
len ratingfive Favorite browser app by far 
len ratingfive Best browser ever 
len ratingone This version of Google Chrome is so buggy it is totally unreliable 
len ratingone Every once in a while you try and open the app and then nothing happens for about seconds and then it just closes by itself 
len ratingone It gets into the state and the only way you can get it to run again is by rebooting your phone 
len ratingone And at that point it forgets every single tab you had opened 
len ratingone I have lost all my tabs so many times I am irate with the monster that is Google 
len ratingone We need to boycott them until they get this right 
len ratingone Never let your app lock up 
len ratingone Never forget all tabs 
len ratingone Indian history always remember the last tab state 
len ratingone This is the worst app I have ever seen because it is so unreliable 
len ratingtwo If this phone had more storage space then I d have kept this app 
len ratingtwo Even when I had this app I still used Safari more often 
len ratingtwo That being stated Google on 
len ratingfive I think the app should also contain the image search 
len ratingfive That will be easy to find a item name that the individual might not know 
len ratingfive Hope i can find this feature soon 
len ratingthree I am faced with unexpected error that causes the page to display an empty gray screen while playing an online video so I have to refresh the page to fix the problem temporarily 
len ratingthree This problem has happened frequently 
len ratingthree Please fix it 
len ratingfive Its google what do you expect 
len ratingfive  stars bud
len ratingone I use drive to play music files that I am working on 
len ratingone It auto skips to the next song in the folder and is not working AT ALL 
len ratingone Majorly upset 
len ratingone Also it s not syncing 
len ratingone And it doesn t show the up to date file date
len ratingfive Got this chair for my kid and it is everything they could want in a gaming chair 
len ratingfive Very comfortable and nicely made 
len ratingfive Would buy again 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingtwo videos dont play but when they do it glitches do much they paise for no reason pls fix asap
len ratingone I ve downloaded the google app before and loved it so when I got a new phone I downloaded google chrome assuming it d be even better 
len ratingone But no 
len ratingone I don t like the way safari format is set up and this app is set up almost exactly like it load up times are slow 
len ratingone I downloaded the other google app to compare performance and the original non chrome version of the google app is superior 
len ratingone Still love Google hate the google chrome app 
len ratingone Needs many modifications to it 
len ratingtwo Why do you have different periods within the keyboard 
len ratingtwo When typing I probably hit that dumb period between the space bar and back space about times a day 
len ratingtwo Horrible 
len ratingthree Chrome has always been my favorite browser however this update has caused the find in page to not work

len ratingtwo When using chrome on my iPhone the chrome app freezes completely not even allowing me to close the tab 
len ratingtwo My only options are restart the phone or delete and reinstall the chrome app 
len ratingone After latest update constantly getting Aw Snap message making the app totally useless 
len ratingone Google needs testing quality control 
len ratingone Please fix ASAP 
len ratingone All I use is chrome and it s driving me crazy 
len ratingone Everything I search for gets returned with suggestions rather then websites 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingone Can we please stop with the back button on top 
len ratingone I need the buttons on the bottom 
len ratingone At least give us an option to optimize it to our own preference 
len ratingone I mean doesn t Google specialize in customization 
len ratingone It s just a bad way of doing things on bigger iPhones 
len ratingone And a read option like safari would be great 
len ratingone All of the sudden when I search within the Chrome app the format of the search results has changed 
len ratingone It s more difficult to read with the softer shades and only two colors rather than three 
len ratingone I guess I m going to have to use Safari when I want to do a Google search 
len ratingone It s more readable over there since the display format hasn t changed 
len ratingone Shame 
len ratingone Up until now I ve always liked Chrome better than Safari 
len ratingone Google Have you heard of the adage If it ain t broke don t fix it 
len ratingone Well now you ve broken it 
len ratingthree Latest version doesn t work
len ratingone Chrome should be called CRASH on iPhone 
len ratingone I live in Google at work and in my personal life 
len ratingone I use Windows iPad iPhone Android and a Great ASUS Chromebook 
len ratingone But I live on my iPhone and Chrome is CRAP on the iPhone crashing crashing crashing Chrome closed unexpectedly would you like to restore NO ID LIKE YOU TO JUST STAY OPEN AND NOT CRASH EVERY TIME I OPEN CHROME AND EVEN WHEN I CLICK TO RESTORE CHROME AFTER EACH CRASH 
len ratingone Google you make more money than governments churches casinos banks and insurance companies and you re acting like Bull Gates giving your users the finger 
len ratingone Don t you see the reason we use you is because Microsoft lost touch and you re repeating it too 
len ratingone I uninstalled Chrome restarted my iPhone and reinstalled Chrome 
len ratingone Maybe it will be Chrome now 
len ratingone  Please kindly let us know if Chrome works for you now 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone I ve encountered different spam pop ups and since I m on mobile there is no way to close them 
len ratingone I have my settings set to disallow pop ups but pop ups still appear 
len ratingthree Google Chrome browser is useful I like ability to voice search 
len ratingthree The main problem is that the ability to clear browser history cookies etc in this browser is buried under several layers 
len ratingthree Given the need for cyber and personal security a user s ability to clear out personal data easily is crucial 
len ratingthree A button that is easily accessible in the address area would be very helpful 
len ratingthree The user would push the button a small dialog box would quickly appear asking for confirmation that you want to clear checked items you confirm and it would be done 
len ratingthree I hope the developers will provide this feature for us soon 
len ratingfive  Safari Safari Safari chrome 
len ratingone This is more like a toy than a tool
len ratingthree I love chrome

len ratingone There s no websites no articles nothing except a handful of videos which when opening the YouTube app it crashes YouTube 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual

len ratingone If this issue doesn t fix I ll probably delete the app its so incredibly annoying especially because there s no way to contact google to ask about this besides writing a f cking app review 
len ratingfive I love it so so so much 
len ratingfive Chrome is exellent 
len ratingone The search results for google no longer return the same results as safari or even the regular desktop

len ratingtwo And as I ve been sitting here trying to figure out where to report a bug on iPad I grow increasingly frustrated 
len ratingtwo I can t seem to figure out how to report but an iPad I can figure out how to do it on a desktop computer but not on an iPad like of people are using 
len ratingtwo I guess I will have to go fire up the desktop to report a bug I m having with Chrome on my iPad does that make sense

len ratingfour So it s already better than most other browsers 
len ratingfour One thing that happens every once in awhile is if I select text it freezes 
len ratingfour Like I can t scroll on the page or anything 
len ratingfour I just close the app all the way and it goes back to normal but honestly I wish they d fix this 
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingfive I work at Bing and I gotta say that this app is better than anything we have every made 
len ratingfive  Bing Manager
len ratingfive I ve always loved chrome 
len ratingfive This release is the best ever 
len ratingfour Why can t we re order bookmarks within the app 
len ratingfour Makes no sense to have to do it on a desktop instead 
len ratingfour Please allow us to re order bookmarks however we want 
len ratingfour Then I ll give you stars 
len ratingfive I wrote a review about how bad the last update was at slowing it down 
len ratingfive This latest update has fixed that problem at least for me 
len ratingfive Thanks Old review Seriously 
len ratingfive When did Google test their latest upgrade 
len ratingfive I now only use it for one forum site which I check once a day 
len ratingfive For the foreseeable future I ll just go back to checking that site on my PC 
len ratingfive Google Chrome is relegated to no longer to be used until I see another update is available 
len ratingfive If anyone at Google is paying attention someone on your team REALLY SCREWED UP 
len ratingtwo There s no option to block cookies on the pc version this would be under the advanced settings 
len ratingfive  style 
len ratingfive  iOS MD 
len ratingone The app takes forever to open 
len ratingone When it finally does it is stuck on a tab from over a week ago and I can t click to a new tab or scroll or anything 
len ratingone It s just frozen 
len ratingone I have to restart my phone just to get back to my home screen 
len ratingone Hey Google 
len ratingone I don t know what kind of updates you did recently on the Chrome browser app but it is very unstable on my iPad now 
len ratingone It s slower crashes often and is completely inoperative on certain sites 
len ratingone Yet my Chrome browser still works fine on my Win laptop 
len ratingone Whatever you did please change it back or fix it 
len ratingone I m about to switch back to Safari 
len ratingfive  home 
len ratingfive Been using Chrome for years 
len ratingfive Tried others but always ended up back on Chrome 
len ratingfive I know Google may not be the best for your information but honestly this app does exactly what I need so I can t complain 
len ratingfive To those that do complain it s free and if you don t like it make your own web browser 
len ratingone I simply cannot rate the Chrome iPad app well until they add a close all tabs option 
len ratingone Will have to use Safari until then because Safari has this feature 
len ratingone I don t understand why you changed the look of google it was fine before why did you change it 
len ratingone Even if you decided to change some things why the look of it 
len ratingone It s just plain weird and almost unusable now 
len ratingone I can t differentiate between different links and don t know where to click 
len ratingone Please change it back 
len ratingone I don t know if it s just an apple phone thing but please no just no 
len ratingthree This was okay but I still think Google s browser is better 
len ratingthree I m not sure if it s specific to particular sites but I have noticed that using chrome while using the stock podcast app will pause the podcast 
len ratingthree Can this be fixed 
len ratingfive Thank you for this application
len ratingone Very annoying 
len ratingone Chrome crashed on me once now it won t even open when I click on it 
len ratingone Updated my phone restarted it etc but it still won t open 
len ratingtwo A nothing 
len ratingtwo I m a huge fan of chrome on the PC and less so on android but the IOS port offers nothing special 
len ratingtwo No one hand zoom in fairness this applies to most other IOS browsers as well 
len ratingtwo This is one of my biggest pet peeves about IOS in general WHY THE 
len ratingtwo DO I HAVE TO USE ENGAGE MY OTHER 
len ratingtwo HAND TO ZOOM IN ON PAGE 
len ratingtwo Android allows you to universally zoom via a double click slide gesture enabling complete one handed operation 
len ratingtwo Google included this gesture in their IOS port of google maps go ahead and try it so why not chrome too 
len ratingtwo If they added this they d win me back as a browser user 
len ratingtwo It s not noticeably faster or snappier than other IOS browsers no reader mode 
len ratingtwo Safari introduced this feature to me and I really love it 
len ratingone Just updated my chrome on iOS 
len ratingone App barely works anymore and it takes a minute to load any tabs 
len ratingone Don t update if you want a usable chrome browser 
len ratingone Feeling so invaded 
len ratingone The more I reinstalled this app the more time I was giving the hacker access to my extremely secured pathway of data on my five week old iPhone 
len ratingone Everything 
len ratingone Ohhhh 
len ratingone PLEASE Google STOP encouraging the G board in the settings think that helped as I had to reset security settings every time 
len ratingone I spent almost two hrs with a live tech support this afternoon 
len ratingone Guess the Apple Store isn t going to like me shortly 
len ratingone I also just purchased the Pro and I sync all my devices 
len ratingone I don t even want to give this app one star 
len ratingone I just purchased this iPhone a Mini Pro and the Samsung Galaxy edge 
len ratingone I receive a response like that 
len ratingfour If not for the battery I d use this by default 
len ratingfour Also would love to see D Touch previews for links
len ratingtwo Chrome works fine for a bit then crashes 
len ratingtwo Usually when I m in Facebook and looking at another page and returning to Chrome then black screen and I have to close it out and restart 
len ratingtwo This is on an iPad Mini also happens on my iPhone 
len ratingtwo Also videos viewed through Chrome crash 
len ratingtwo Wassamatta Google 
len ratingtwo Chrome works fine on my Windows laptop 
len ratingtwo I just wish Chrome wasn t so ubiquitous 
len ratingone There really isn t much point to this app on iOS 
len ratingone Don t get me wrong I love Chrome on the desktop 
len ratingone However apple forbade the use of any other browser engine in iOS app except for its own webkit so you aren t getting the web engine that makes Chrome on the desktop rock 
len ratingone So that means no WebM video no WebRTC and a host of other features that you use in Chrome that you never think about 
len ratingone So what you are basically left with is a Google wrapper around webkit so you might as well just use Safari 
len ratingone Not Google s fault they have to abide by apples rules 
len ratingfour Traffic compression works on iphone s 
len ratingfour I like google chrome but because of its progrsmme continue to use Safari 
len ratingfour Hope you guys change the design of your application 
len ratingfour Thanks
len ratingone Really getting tried of this happening plz fix ur app
len ratingthree The key feature of chrome besides syncing your history across multiple versions of chrome is the variety of extensions and customizations 
len ratingthree I use many on the desktop version and was hoping they would eventually be implemented here 
len ratingthree They have not been and I can get them in the default browser now so I have no reason to recommend this app 
len ratingthree The user experience is identical to any mobile browser nowadays and there is no way to block intrusive push ads 
len ratingthree So sad 
len ratingfive Nice app
len ratingone I ve never left a review on an app before until now 
len ratingone This was bad enough that I took the time to say how much of a piece of crap this is 
len ratingone I generally use Chrome on my laptop and phone for some reason it rarely works on my ipad and when it does is so slow time almost stops its basically useless 
len ratingfive  app 
len ratingone Awful update pointless footer toolbar prevents clicking on footer menus on web pages re inventing the wheel here what was wrong with the last layout that we all had to switch 
len ratingtwo This is a very clean app and I really want to to like it but it crashed a lot 
len ratingtwo I finally had too much and deleted it 
len ratingtwo I would love to use it if fixed 
len ratingone Crashes upon opening 
len ratingone Reinstalling didn t help
len ratingone The app is badly in need of updating 
len ratingone Freezes on sign in freezes on google search freezes on webpages if left open too long 
len ratingone CHECK MY OTHER REVIEW IF YOU WANT ANSWERS 
len ratingone It s been my understanding that Google has been one of the companies making a stand against porn while they may not be making a profit off of advertising and links their Google Chrome app is an open door to it in spite of wifi filters Circle and set Parental Control Restrictions and all the teens know it 
len ratingone I am disappointed Google 
len ratingone I thought you were a better company than that 
len ratingone Maybe that will be a selling point for people downloading this app but I won t be using Google Chrome again 
len ratingthree Have the same browser on my mac but I wish the mobile could connect with my Chromecast like it does for my computer 
len ratingone I wish I could rate the chrome browser ZERO stars 
len ratingone I open a page browse for a bit them BAM Chrome locks up throws a hissy fit and closes entirely 
len ratingone Compute lay useless in its current state 
len ratingone Time to download Firefox as I despise Safari 
len ratingfour I love the idea of syncing between computer and iPhone but it would be a lot cooler if a 
len ratingfour you could sync only the tabs you wanted and b 
len ratingfour you could import tabs from safari when you first download the app 
len ratingfour If you guys can add those features I will delete Safari from my phone 
len ratingone To match my PC settings with logins and passwords 
len ratingone If chrome can t do that it s useless on my IPad Pro 
len ratingfour  Can not clean cached data
len ratingone Crashes whenever I try and search anything in the address bar
len ratingone I am using chrome on iPhone on nytimes and can t get videos to work 
len ratingone This should be core experience as the best content is in now 
len ratingone Please fix and I will update review
len ratingtwo no d touch support inconvenient while typing with random scrolls and inability to see typing boxes
len ratingfive Its ability to smoothly link in with all the other google services makes it a must have 
len ratingfive I like chrome better
len ratingone Keep on crashing
len ratingfive I have used chrome browser on iPhone for years and haven t had a problem love the browser 
len ratingone Why did you change the way google searches look 
len ratingone I hate it so much 
len ratingone Ugh
len ratingone EVERY SINGLE USE no matter what time of day or night no matter what website and no matter if just tab or more is open either an Aww Snap Error Page pops up replacing your tab s or the app closes entirely 
len ratingone I have uninstalled and reinstalled repeatedly over a period of months to no avail 
len ratingone App is garbage and doesn t work any more 
len ratingfour The update now causes my s to heat up extremely quickly while reading an article 
len ratingfour Case off not charging at the same time no videos in the background just an article and it s burning hot 
len ratingone I will accidentally or unknowingly pull down on the screen and the page refreshes undoing all of the progress I had on the current page
len ratingone  There is no option to close all tabs at once in the iPad App Bloated and sluggish
len ratingthree World s fastest web browser 
len ratingthree Obviously that didn t translate over to mobile 
len ratingthree Also gets stuck a lot
len ratingfour The only feature I need Chrome to have is the reader view 
len ratingfour Safari has it and makes reading articles on the browser very convenient and it would be really nice if Chrome gets it as well 
len ratingone No more audio in the background
len ratingone I m having the same problem that some others are having 
len ratingone The app won t open at all 
len ratingone So can t use chrome at all on my iPad 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingfour It s useful
len ratingfive  vpn v 
len ratingone Fix issue cannot download a file from eBay failed to download
len ratingtwo Latest iterations of the app have gotten worse and worse continues to slow down and feel bloated 
len ratingtwo Only sticking with it because I m fine with it on desktop
len ratingone I received a pop up saying my browser needs to be fixed or I will be blocked 
len ratingone due to viruses etc 
len ratingone Siri directed me to this APP which after my password etc won t open 
len ratingone Any suggestions 
len ratingone Anybody 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingtwo Autofill barely works 
len ratingfive It s a fantastic app to use and very fast
len ratingtwo It opens but then when I start typing when I type the next letter the last on disappears 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingtwo Not sure why but it isn t working anymore for some reason 
len ratingtwo Just downloads and site on my add account page and then crashes 
len ratingtwo  buggy 
len ratingone While browsing on an iPhone S I often experience lock ups or crashes where the browser screen goes to a solid dark grey background 
len ratingone The history back forth keys bookmarks and refresh features have no effect also 
len ratingone Only workaround is to exit the browser app and reopen 
len ratingone I hope this is resolved soon 
len ratingone No longer opens after update 
len ratingone Crashes right when I open it 
len ratingone I worked before 
len ratingone Frustrated 
len ratingone Was a great app 
len ratingone Now keeps freezing 
len ratingone New tabs don t display without freezing 
len ratingone Gmail in Chrome especially problematic 
len ratingone I can t see any incremental benefit of the new release only negatives 
len ratingone I wished this day would never come but I m switching to Safari 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone We appreciate it 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingfive  Stars Plain Simple GC the gold standard of web browsers 
len ratingfive Who cares if you can play You Tube music in the background 
len ratingfive That has nothing to do with the purpose service or quality of Google Chrome 
len ratingfive There are a plethora of ways to listen to music 
len ratingfive In contrast Google Chrome is one of the very few preferred default web browsers 
len ratingone Now it constantly crashes 
len ratingone I ve pretty much memorized the Aww snap error 
len ratingone  iPhone s Plus Update May The app has become unusable 
len ratingone The screen goes white and becomes unresponsive 
len ratingfive I was concerned when I saw the bad reviews for Chrome but I decided to download it and give it a try 
len ratingfive I haven t had any problems at all 
len ratingfive I saw that a lot of people said that it was slow but I haven t had that happen 
len ratingfive I guess it depends on what you are trying to do on the browser 
len ratingtwo Just updated to on iPad Air and Chrome isn t responsive 
len ratingtwo I can t get it to open nor will it uninstall 
len ratingtwo Note it finally uninstalled after moving it from the task bar 
len ratingone I m not sure why but as of this morning google chrome app has stopped working won t open freezes even froze my phone 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone We appreciate it 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingthree The App is wonderful but bring back the function of playing music in the control center that would make it great again
len ratingone On an iPhone running and the app doesn t even try to open when I press it 
len ratingone Very disappointing 
len ratingtwo Background play was the main reason I used this app 
len ratingtwo Requiring YouTube Red subscription for this functionality is lame IMO 
len ratingtwo Removed app from iPhone 
len ratingfive I really like the Google Chrome app 
len ratingfive It s really nice having all my chrome account data synced with my iPhone I just have a few suggestions for the app 
len ratingfive  The AutoFill feature could be improved 
len ratingfive Sometimes things will AutoFill on the desktop version but it won t AutoFill for me on the mobile version 
len ratingfive  Sometimes the page will go unresponsive 
len ratingfive Chrome will be okay but I won t be able to interact with the page until I manually put in the address again 
len ratingfive Refreshing does not work 
len ratingfive This only happens sometimes 
len ratingfive  Some pages are missing a Find in Page feature 
len ratingfive I have to switch over to safari to use its feature 
len ratingfive Overall great app 
len ratingfive The best browser
len ratingtwo Not much point to the app now that you can t play audio from videos in the background any more 
len ratingtwo It was the only reason a second browsing app was worth having 
len ratingone Still having the same issue as the previous update 
len ratingone Whenever I go to do anything it always takes a few moments to register the action and then it crashes 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone It s annoying when I need to look something up
len ratingtwo I had IMPORTANT tabs open and as soon as the app updated all my tabs are gone so much for an update thanks for nothing 
len ratingfive  Great Bookmark Sync
len ratingone Just updated this app this morning it won t open up at all now What s going on over at Google that this happens 
len ratingone After the latest update Chrome will no longer open 
len ratingone I ve reinstalled a few times and have the same problem the icon doesn t react to touch at all not sure what happened here 
len ratingone Instead of all these pointless updates fix the annoying Aww Snap 
len ratingone bug 
len ratingone I am tired of loading up a web page or in middle of reading a website only to have page pop with with stupid Aww Snap 
len ratingone thing

len ratingtwo History search keeps crashing app
len ratingone  Yapicanis isi sikim
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingtwo more often than the older version
len ratingone Whatever version that they just installed on my phone doesn t work it won t go past the email sign in screen meh FIX IT PLEASE 
len ratingone I can t even justify one star 
len ratingone Chrome has rusted out 
len ratingone Especially after this last update 
len ratingone It was supposed to fix bugs not create more 
len ratingone  I ve been using Chrome as my iPad browser for a few years 
len ratingone It s had sporadic problems in the past but with this latest update it s become unusable 
len ratingone It literally takes forever to load a page when the same page loads on Safari in seconds 
len ratingone And if you pale in comparison to Safari you are in a heap of trouble 
len ratingone And now it crashes early and often 
len ratingone Hey you imbeciles at Google are you so busy spying on us see Waze that you ve overburdened your own servers 
len ratingone We re on to your corporate spying 
len ratingone Knock it off and get your software to work you clowns 
len ratingtwo  Was a great app 
len ratingtwo Now keeps freezing 
len ratingtwo New tabs don t display without freezing 
len ratingtwo Gmail innChrome especially problematic 
len ratingtwo I can t see any incremental benefit of the new release only negatives 
len ratingtwo  What happened 
len ratingtwo Why is Chrome no longer a project create for simple use and fast performance 
len ratingtwo If I wanted all these needless features I d use a custom version of Chrome 
len ratingone  As of today the app won t launch 
len ratingone It s been fine until now but looking at all the other issues here I ll just stick to safari 
len ratingone Who has the time 
len ratingfive  Chrome has become an incredible alternative browser on iOS 
len ratingfive It s fast syncs bookmarks with the Mac version and even has a built in QR code reader and widget now 
len ratingfive It even has split view on the iPad 
len ratingfive They ve done an amazing job recently supporting the latest iOS features with the exception of D touch peek and pop within the app to preview links 
len ratingfive I would love to see this added if it s possible within the limitations of iOS 
len ratingfive The bookmarks UI still feels clunky as well 
len ratingfive It s difficult to go back to the top level bookmarks list no back button and I feel like it should be easier to edit bookmarks as well 
len ratingfive Overall amazing app and I love using this as my daily browser 
len ratingone I never had this many issues with using the Chrome browser app and now it s not even operating properly 
len ratingone The app won t even let me get to the home page before timing out 
len ratingone Any links I click on via email to trigger the app to open leads to a dead end 
len ratingone I hope the Google team resolves the issue with this very soon because it really is a change of pace having to use an alternate browser I m not as fond of 
len ratingone Have to start using Firefox 
len ratingone  I ve been using Chrome as my primary browser for several years 
len ratingone Mainly because of the shared bookmarks and passwords with Chrome on my PC 
len ratingone In the last week or so with latest IOS v Chrome shuts down after a minute or so of operation 
len ratingone I ve tried signing out of Google deleting Chrome and reinstalling with no results 
len ratingone UPDATE I keep trying latest versions of Chrome app and it continues to be virtually unusable freezing intermittently sometimes for seconds other times requiring shutdown and restart of the app 
len ratingone Highly recommend you not try this app 
len ratingtwo  This app has totally tanked 
len ratingtwo Crashes all the time 
len ratingtwo History is inaccessible and crashes when you try to type 
len ratingtwo This issue should not have gone this long without resolution from a giant like google 
len ratingtwo Disappointed 
len ratingone  Lately it keeps crashing whenever I browse a website 
len ratingfive  VPN 
len ratingone  Chrome is now a major battery hog 
len ratingone Battery has been sucked down regularly since the update 
len ratingfour  A bit messy the google search app is much better for mobile and this is better for desktop 
len ratingfour It s not the best but okay usable 
len ratingfour I would like to see in the widget a button that closes the incognito tabs similar to how that option is on the Android side 
len ratingone Last update ruined google on my PC and on my iPhone 
len ratingone Fix this crap

len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingone This used to be a pretty solid and dependable app 
len ratingone The past few releases have been awful 
len ratingone My browser has been restarting for no reason frequently pages die without clear cause and reloading the pages can at times take seconds if I don t kill the app first
len ratingthree This is happening often 
len ratingthree I reload same site with Safari and no crash 
len ratingfive Most of the components of iOS have turned into a mess 
len ratingfive Widgets don t work mail frequently loses sync reminders frequently fail to alert Safari can t delete all cookies etc 
len ratingfive Google Chrome steps in to at least save the day for my web browsing 
len ratingfive It works so much better than the slow and bug riddled Safari 
len ratingfive I ve stopped using Safari and it s numerous zombie cookies 
len ratingfive Google also helped by offering replacements for iOS mail and iOS calendar 
len ratingfive Now if only they could show Apple how to make a properly functioning widget 
len ratingfive Sometimes I really envy Android owners 
len ratingone  Program is so slow I no longer use it 
len ratingone In the past it was my favorite browser but safari is considerably faster now 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem

len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone We appreciate it 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual

len ratingone Even the search bar or URL bar doesn t load 
len ratingone Deleted the app and downloaded again in the hope that it may solve he issue but no 
len ratingone The update made switching between tabs extremely slow 
len ratingone Clicking links and web pages loading are so slow that I actually thought my phone was broken

len ratingone We appreciate it

len ratingthree  I rode my google chrome into work the other day and scratched the portal trim while making a routine right hand turn 
len ratingthree I love the power to weight ratio but for those not familiar with thrust vectoring let alone the torque steer of this beast you ll be in for a ride 
len ratingthree Three stars because I can t seem to find a competent google chrome mechanic able enough to fix my portal trim and prior drivetrain issues that have only been getting worse 
len ratingthree When the google chrome is in top form nothing else quite drives the same 
len ratingthree  Hey every time I try to search in history the app crashes 
len ratingthree Can you fix this glitch 
len ratingthree Thank you 
len ratingtwo  AGAIN PLEEEEEASE get rid of the pull down to refresh feature 
len ratingtwo When your scrolling to the top of a page especially when ordering something it s REALLY annoying to have the page refresh and have to input all your information AGAIN 
len ratingtwo It s just weird and in the way 
len ratingtwo Anybody there 
len ratingtwo Helloooooooo 
len ratingone Subject says it all 
len ratingone This has been a thing for a long time 
len ratingone Might as well use Safari 
len ratingtwo My chrome crashes very consistently I m not sure what causes it but it s not working particularly well 
len ratingone  App stopped working and if I wait for a while with the hope that something might show up the app crashes 
len ratingone There is no way to report a bug as well 
len ratingone So that this review as a bug report 
len ratingfive Cd
len ratingone This program is very unstable in its current iteration 
len ratingone It has a tendency to crash upon opening 
len ratingone What s worse is this crash is so severe it does not even give you the restore tabs option so some tabs are lost all the information you ve researched is lost you re totally screwed over by this app 
len ratingone You safari if you can 
len ratingone The developers of this app should use common sense to back up the entire tab list every time a new tab is opened 
len ratingone This should be something that is there always so that any crash can recover the very last tab state in perpetuity and reinitialization should not clear that tap state 
len ratingone It s pure programming incompetence that they don t do this as it would be very easy to do and not slow down the application substantially 
len ratingone For shame Google for shame 
len ratingthree  I m Owen Taggart I m a American
len ratingfour  Great app 
len ratingfour Chrome is so much better than using safari 
len ratingfour  Reader mode is hit or miss

len ratingone New Chrome update from days ago and latest iOS 
len ratingone  Deleted
len ratingfive  chrome 
len ratingtwo I use chrome every single day 
len ratingtwo The latest automatic update made it terribly slow 
len ratingtwo Every time I want to open a tab or switch from one tab to another one it takes anywhere from three to five seconds to do so 
len ratingtwo I know it sounds like I am impatient but it used to be able to do that immediately 
len ratingtwo Maybe going from one tab to another just once is not a big deal but if you re like me and do that several times in minutes it gets REALLY annoying 
len ratingtwo Please fix this 
len ratingtwo Thanks Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingtwo We appreciate it

len ratingtwo  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem

len ratingfive  It s pretty good
len ratingone  They ruined everything
len ratingfive  I have used this app a lot and I never have problems with it 
len ratingfive  rt 
len ratingone  I remember when Chrome was first released its allure was that it was a very light browser that was just FAST 
len ratingone Over the years with incremental changes management of this Google project has fallen into the same trap that eveything else does They lost sight of the initial vision 
len ratingone Chrome is now so bogged down by features that it has become one of the worst and slowest apps out there on the iPhone and the computer 
len ratingone We re systematically removing it from our computers and servers at work now because it has become just useless 
len ratingone I don t know whether it s 
len ratingone Chrome why must Google s products be SO constantly dependent on a live Internet connection 
len ratingone or perhaps it s Google punishing those of us who choose iPhone over Android or iOS why must Apple s updates be SO backwards in compatible 
len ratingone or perhaps it s Apple punishing those of us who choose Chrome over Safari but this damned browser crashes CONSTANTLY 
len ratingone Especially if you use the synced bookmarks a lot like me which is pretty much the main reason you would choose a browser over Safari the ability to sync your bookmarks and or tabs with a PC or any non Apple computer or device 
len ratingone I m sick of being the collatoral damage in the war between Apple and Google 
len ratingone At least when Microsoft ruled the earth back in the days of Bill Gates the products more or less worked and were backwards compatible 
len ratingone  Won t even open since the update I m so disappointed 
len ratingone May have to start using safari and I may like it 
len ratingfive  Works perfectly fine on and iPhone plus
len ratingthree  KKK 
len ratingone  Ayo homies in mountain view 
len ratingone This broken 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingtwo  When I click a Google search link it tries to load the page and then just goes back to the search results 
len ratingtwo Have to open in new tab to view it 
len ratingtwo Frustrating 
len ratingfive When I try to load a website from Google search results in incognito mode the tabs close instantly 
len ratingfive  It was great
len ratingone After the update I can t have background sound playing 
len ratingone Incredibly slow 
len ratingone  My app doesn t even open 
len ratingone  Since the update the screen will go straight to the bottom of the page and I can t stop it 
len ratingone I ve been google for years after the recent upgrade downgrade really it won t even open 
len ratingone I ve uninstalled reinstalled several times and it just won t open 
len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingone  Crash crash crash almost every time you use it s crashing 
len ratingone Constantly having to reset the phone or re install this app typical google junk 
len ratingtwo I ve been using this app for years but after this last update all it does is crash 
len ratingtwo When I try to pull up websites it crashes when I try to look back on my history it crashes 
len ratingtwo I don t know if it s my phone or the app but hopefully this gets resolved quick 
len ratingone After I got the recent update all my bookmarks were deleted 
len ratingone Not happy 
len ratingone  Update slowed everything down go back to last update please 
len ratingone I have been a loyal user of chrome I DO NOT USE ANY OTHER BROWSER 
len ratingone But what has gone wrong with chrome lately 
len ratingone Every time I try searching my history it crashes 
len ratingone Then I see all the tabs are out of sync and last but not the least it crashes again when I open a tab 
len ratingthree  At the homepage there is a button that says apps but when I tap on it it doesn t show the apps
len ratingone  Boooooooo 
len ratingfour  safari vpn Safari ui Safari 
len ratingfive  What a surprise Like all their other programs i was expecting failure but honestly it ain t bad 
len ratingfive I m new to it but thus far I like it much better than safari and firefox 
len ratingfive Safari side swipe is crazy annoying and firefox doesn t allow you to edit bookmarks 
len ratingfive If firefox would fix the bookmarks it would be a strong contender 
len ratingfive I m using iphone 
len ratingone  Loved chrome before the new update 
len ratingone Now it s extremely slow and lags real hard 
len ratingone Strongly suggest waiting for update 
len ratingone Worked great until the last update now there s a delay when creating a new tab 
len ratingone Delay when loading a new page on pages that previously took a fraction of the time to load 
len ratingone Needs to be fixed fast 
len ratingone  This update crashes all the time 
len ratingone Then I lost ALL OF MY TABS 
len ratingone I actually use that stuff 
len ratingone I m pretty angry about this 
len ratingone  New update constantly crashing my browser
len ratingone Chrome froze partway through the latest update 
len ratingone Now it won t open 
len ratingone I uninstalled it thinking a fresh install would help but iOS won t let me 
len ratingone I have to install the broken version from the cloud or go to another browser 
len ratingone I guess Firefox it is then 
len ratingone Since the update everything is horribly slow 
len ratingone Switching between or opening tabs takes no less than seconds to do 
len ratingone It used to be great and now it s horrible 
len ratingone Fix it now please 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone We appreciate it 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingone  If the latest update was to make it not function you did an excellent job keep it up 
len ratingthree  Chrome

len ratingfive  Its better than safari at least 
len ratingtwo  I guess it s still useable but it s extremely laggy 
len ratingone Everything runs very slowly since the latest update 
len ratingone It appears I m not the only one with the issue 
len ratingone Opening a new tab can take seconds or so before the window shows up 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone We appreciate it 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingfive  Write a Review
len ratingtwo  Seriously 
len ratingtwo When did Google test their latest upgrade 
len ratingtwo I now only use it for one forum site which I check once a day 
len ratingtwo For the foreseeable future I ll just go back to checking that site on my PC 
len ratingtwo Google Chrome is relegated to no longer to be used until I see another update is available 
len ratingtwo If anyone at Google is paying attention someone on your team REALLY SCREWED UP 
len ratingone  Fix this asap
len ratingone  When you open a new page in new tap you need to be inside the page to make ot loaded also in PC MAC 
len ratingone Your latest updates made me delete chrome in all my devices 
len ratingone After updating trying to use Chrome is agonizingly slow 
len ratingone Especially when trying to open new tabs close tabs or load new pages 
len ratingone It s honestly gotten so bad that I ve started using safari again and that s an issue 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone We appreciate it 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingone  crashes a lot 
len ratingtwo  Lately my chrome app has not let me even begin to use it before an ad pops up telling me I won something 
len ratingtwo Normally 
len ratingtwo If I close the app or hit the back button I m fine 
len ratingtwo Now it won t even let me do anything except hit ok which I m not going to do 
len ratingtwo The app is useless to me right now

len ratingone Luckily theres other fish in the sea 
len ratingone I m going with Dolphin 
len ratingone And yes I know Dolphins are not fish 
len ratingone In the past I would use chrome to listen to music while multi tasking but now the video cuts when exiting the screen which really kills my vibe 
len ratingone Now I see less benefits in comparison to using safari 
len ratingone  Downloaded this because safari wouldn t background play and this app did 
len ratingone Until the update 
len ratingone Thought it was my phone till I saw other reviews stating the same 
len ratingone That s a shame

len ratingfive  I love using Chrome on mobile devices it s simple and reliable 
len ratingfive Recently switching to an iPhone I had to download this app promptly 
len ratingfive I was a bit disappointed when I didn t see a home button 
len ratingfive Can this be added in a future update 
len ratingfive Also can we see a settings option to close the app when the last tab is closed 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work

len ratingone The latest update causes Chrome to freeze right after opening 
len ratingone Can t navigate anywhere 
len ratingone I gave them a few days to either revert back to the last version or release a new one 
len ratingone Didn t happen so it s off my phone for good 
len ratingone Bye 
len ratingone  This version is NOT an improvement it makes things worse 
len ratingone I never noticed any delay in previous versions except for waiting for the page to download which depends on the cell WiFi bandwidth 
len ratingone This time around there s a delay several seconds just to close a darned tab 
len ratingfive  like chrome
len ratingthree  I ve used this app for years and after updating I can t even access the app 
len ratingthree I uninstalled reinstalled to no avail 
len ratingthree I m not sure if iPhone s OS update or the app update is responsible for this 
len ratingthree It looks like I can access w out freezing crashing if I don t sign in to my account but that defeats the purpose of why I liked it before 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingone Can t listen to YouTube audio anymore when I exit app 
len ratingone This is very necessary

len ratingone  First problem is started after the update all my tabs were cleared then I found out there s no background audio not even in app with different tabs then I get hear and see I m not alone and some have it worse with consistent crashes 
len ratingone Needs Adobe flash 
len ratingone Not worth using 
len ratingone How much longer on the flash 
len ratingone It also crashes 
len ratingone  Can barely use the browser now 
len ratingone It takes a long time to start up and switching tabs is clunky 
len ratingone The last update screwed everything up 
len ratingone Can t play music in background anymore horrible 
len ratingone Read the title 
len ratingone  In order to promote their subpar app YouTube Red they removed the option to play videos in the background a function even safari can do 
len ratingone This is simply annoying and an inconvience 
len ratingone No one wants to pay money to have such a simple task be available 
len ratingone No one wants your YouTube Red google 
len ratingone Give us back old Chrome that actually worked

len ratingfive  This app is pretty good I have no complaints 
len ratingone  This is the first bad update I ve have from google 
len ratingone Incredibly slow for opening updating pages and changing between tabs 
len ratingone Avoid the update 
len ratingone Since this most recent update the apps been constantly freezing 
len ratingone I can t even use it anymore and have had to resort to using safari 
len ratingone Come on google fix this joint 
len ratingone Smh my head
len ratingone  I thought it was just my phone that is acting weird but seeing other people s reviews made me realize that the latest update made the app slow 
len ratingone I use Chrome to play music in the background but because of the update I can no longer do that 
len ratingone The video buffers and plays normally when I am on that page but as soon as I leave it it buffers again and stops the current video 
len ratingone The app also has a delay on clicks whenever I press something on a page it takes a few seconds to register and load 
len ratingone Before the update the app functioned like normal when I first got it 
len ratingone What happened 
len ratingone  Thank you for letting us know about this issue and your patience as we fixed the problem 
len ratingone We appreciate it 
len ratingone Google Chrome should now be working as usual 
len ratingone  The latest update has made a good browser into one that is very poor 
len ratingone It lags noticeably when opening or closing a tab or when clicking on a link that opens a new tab 
len ratingone It still crashes on certain pages and now I ve even seen it completely freeze 
len ratingone So much for stability fixes 
len ratingtwo  So for some reason its really really laggy now switching between tabs and clicking links has a big delay

len ratingone  Crashes all the time since last update 
len ratingone Anytime I click a link or open a new browser window the app crashes 
len ratingtwo  I was a huge fan of the Chrome app until very recently I m positive that I am not alone when I say that this most recent patch seems in no way intended to improve the app but to reduce accessibility to Youtube in an effort to increase revenue from Youtube Red a paid subscription service that unfortunately capitalizes on a resource that was until last year completely free to users 
len ratingtwo This patch is a simple act of coercion and I would strongly discourage anyone considering subscribing to Youtube Red from doing so as it would just be a cession of more power and money to Google over consumers 
len ratingtwo I used to think you were cool Google 
len ratingtwo What happened 
len ratingone  Try to search your history 
len ratingone Chrome will crash every time 
len ratingone with the ability to listen to YouTube while your phone is asleep gone you might as well use dolphin browser now

len ratingthree  Go to History tap the loupe icon type a word and press the space bar 
len ratingthree Crashes every time 
len ratingthree I updated 
len ratingthree It crashed 
len ratingthree Opened it again and tried to restore my tabs 
len ratingthree Crash again and now all my tabs are erased and I have to start all over again 
len ratingthree Not only that whenever I try to search my history to find the last pages my tabs were on Chrome crashes 
len ratingthree The only reason I m now using Chrome is because I have all my passwords on it and it syncs with the desktop version of Chrome 
len ratingone  So called stability improvements just made the app very unstable 
len ratingfive I am a iPhone user I can t use chrome
len ratingone  This latest update has improved nothing it s worse now and it s too laggy
len ratingtwo  Chrome is just as good as Safari that s built in on iPhone 
len ratingtwo It also can t block ads something Safari can do and it also has an awful UI X 
len ratingtwo Unless you really love Google for some reason you don t need Chrome 
len ratingthree  I would give it stars but many other mobile browsers have ad blocking available and that only works on desktop chrome 
len ratingone Among other bugs chrome has often blocked attempts to open pdfs in other applications a feature I use often 
len ratingone In addition the load times to open pdfs that do cooperate is orders of magnitude slower than safari 
len ratingone Please update soon 
len ratingone  Love this app but I m beyond annoyed that you can t play music while the app in in the background 
len ratingone Refuse to change my review until they fix this 
len ratingfive  I am happy about it
len ratingone Bugs will never ends 
len ratingone Every version got its own new bugs 
len ratingone  And now I can t even access by history to see it I can get them back 
len ratingone And this isn t the first time this has happened 
len ratingone Good job Chrome 
len ratingfive Great I use it for porn and nobody will go to it

len ratingtwo Can t edit default browser setting
len ratingone chrome won t open 
len ratingone it freezes on the open screen and then crashes 
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone  I didn t have problems with Chrome for iOS until about a month ago 
len ratingone It now works for maybe one click on search results then when the page I actually want to look at loads the app does not respond to scrolling rendering it completely useless 
len ratingone  Please do not use Google Chrome when you login our website is not compatible with chrome Per De Anza College Google you need to fix this problem now 
len ratingfive  WiFi 
len ratingone  ask Latin LBS
len ratingtwo  rd update iOS on an iPhone Plus 
len ratingtwo constantly hanging 
len ratingtwo Restarting helps a bit 
len ratingtwo Uninstalling and reinstalling not at all 
len ratingtwo Very annoying 
len ratingtwo Those star ratings I give it just keep going down down Update I still love chrome and think it s the best of the mobile browsers 
len ratingtwo Sadly I had to delete it It s chewing through my battery so I have to recharge at least twice daily if not more 
len ratingtwo I ve tried about the browsers Settling on Firefox but still don t like it 
len ratingtwo Google please fix that 
len ratingtwo I ve come to terms with crashes but how can I come to terms with having a nonfunctional phone 
len ratingtwo  I ve been using Chrome on my phone for a long time but now I have Evil iOS 
len ratingtwo Like w so many other things it s unstable crashes regularly along w Google Earth 
len ratingtwo Apple claims some mysterious unnamed app I ve installed every time I reset or replace my phone is causing the instability I think it s the operating system 
len ratingtwo Still I use it because it s better than Safari 
len ratingtwo Lots better 
len ratingtwo Folks who complain about losing Auto fill or cookies check your settings 
len ratingtwo Allow push notifications 
len ratingtwo Maybe you can resolve some of these issues easily 
len ratingtwo Otherwise Google the problem for a fix 
len ratingtwo Folks who still have iOS don t upgrade until Apple admits they messed up w and they fix it

len ratingfive  Tell me why 
len ratingfive  I love this app
len ratingfive  rt 
len ratingone Chrome used to be my go to but since the last update I can t load many websites I frequent it crashes takes forever to load I can go on but I m already annoyed 
len ratingone I was never a fan of Safari but it s been pretty great compared to Chrome so that s where I ll be from now on 
len ratingone  Dude sooooo freaking slow 
len ratingone Is hardcore lagging on wifi and data everything 
len ratingone  Safari is much better 
len ratingtwo  Very bad
len ratingtwo I want to Block Ads in Cricbuzz When I was opening Cricbuzz in Chrome of my Iphone I was Getting Ads which is disturbing
len ratingfive  good
len ratingone Can t play YouTube on one tab and do something on another tab at the same time
len ratingfive I wish it wasn t this was the fastest browser I had to do my homework since my default search is extremely slow even though I have great wifi 
len ratingone Time to find a browser that lets me play YouTube in the background with the phone locked 
len ratingone  I used to use Chrome so I can play YouTube videos audio even after minimizing the app 
len ratingone Now you re not able to do this anymore and it makes me sad 
len ratingfive The app is much better than Safari 
len ratingfive I just wish I could make it the default browser 
len ratingfive F ck you apple
len ratingone  you all have taken the best internet browser in mobile history and made it crap in less usable windows internet explorer with dial up internet 
len ratingone i though someone hacked my account due to slow and unresponsiveness 
len ratingone i figure my passwords were changed and was awaiting incorrect password notices 
len ratingone i ESPECIALLY hate that i can no longer play youtube in the background or with the screen off 
len ratingone the VAST majority of content i watch is audio only so i listened without the screen on 
len ratingone NOW i can t take in content without using up battery much MUCH faster that with the screen being off 
len ratingone for SHAME Google 
len ratingone No easter doodle since but obscure things get a doodle all the time 
len ratingone Is my faith offensive to you 
len ratingone Over a billion people of every race and nation share that faith 
len ratingone The doodle of the Juno team that s not representative of them but you had to make them more diverse bc their real race is offensive to you 
len ratingone You re like the arts department at a liberal college you pretend to hate racism but really race is all you think about 
len ratingone Well I ll be telling all of my family to not use google 
len ratingthree  This browser can be great at times for some reason on some days it can be obnoxious to watch videos and freezes the play button or it wont load and that s mainly all I use it for to watch videos like movies etc 
len ratingthree I think it is okay just needs some improvements such as randomly reloading pages and the video issue 
len ratingthree Why no clean reader like safari 
len ratingthree Why do I need to purchase a third party browser to get a built in Chromecast solution 
len ratingthree  I like this app but honestly it is a bit of a pain to use 
len ratingthree At random times it gets hijacked by fake warning messages the scams where you need to call a number to fix your device 
len ratingthree Closing and re opening the browser is useless so it needs to be deleted and reinstalled 
len ratingthree This is getting tiresome 
len ratingthree Today s hijacking was at a library site of all things 
len ratingthree Reinstalling now Google the tech kings 
len ratingthree LOL 
len ratingfive  Works fine here
len ratingone Not what s going on but the app keeps crashing 
len ratingone I ve already uninstalled and reinstalled the app
len ratingfour  iPad 
len ratingone  Every time you try to go to a server hosted on a local IP address it redirects to a search which obviously doesn t help 
len ratingone Let people enter their own URLs 
len ratingone  Stop using services from this awful company 
len ratingone The invade your privacy and abuse American foreign workers with HB visas 
len ratingone The Feds need to break them up
len ratingtwo  I ve always loved the Chrome browser for iPad 
len ratingtwo But as soon as I put restrictions for my kids on my device it wouldn t open 
len ratingtwo Please fix this in your next update 
len ratingtwo Five stars to you if you fix it 
len ratingone  It works very bad and slowly 
len ratingone I prefer to use safari as my browser 
len ratingone  Please stop censoring opinions you don t like
len ratingfive  It s convenient 
len ratingfive Chrome has always been my number one browser 
len ratingfive It s so fast i am happy about it 
len ratingfive  I opened a PDF in a separate window and I hit the share button 
len ratingfive I could open it in notes and something else but I was not amble to open it in notability Please fix
len ratingone  One of the most irritating glitches happens to be trying to go to my Google Plus brand page 
len ratingone No matter what I try I get bumped back to my Youtube channel 
len ratingone I never had this issue with other browsers 
len ratingtwo How to save password for any forums 
len ratingone  This browser doesn t support ad blocking like Safari which means browsing is slower uses more battery and data 
len ratingone It doesn t even have the old data saving function it used to have 
len ratingone Don t see why I d need this browser when the stock Safari does a better job 
len ratingfour  like
len ratingone Just use Safari 
len ratingone The chrome app is so unreliable that it s practically useless 
len ratingone Need to scroll up 
len ratingone It ll think you want to refresh the page 
len ratingone Need to scroll to the side 
len ratingone It ll go back to the previous page 
len ratingone Need to Google something 
len ratingone It ll sit on a blank screen with the URL for your search and do nothing unless you retype your search query 
len ratingfive  Write a Review
len ratingthree  Latest Chrome must be taking advantage of changes in federal regulations 
len ratingthree It seems to even know what your other browsers are up to 
len ratingthree It also universally slows down your phone unless you enable restrictions 
len ratingthree It s a shame but I think they ve gone off the deep end this time with the free information harvesting 
len ratingthree Maybe they thought people are just used to it by now 
len ratingfour  Voice activation is excellent 
len ratingfour Browser is above average
len ratingthree  pc 
len ratingtwo Last two updates specifically the last one have ruined this app 
len ratingtwo Please fix this I hate safari
len ratingfour  Please make Chrome UI clear and simple 
len ratingone  so like I usually use safari for my work and stuff and I use chrome for my music but all of a sudden it won t play out of the app 
len ratingone It used to let me listen to it if I scrolled up the screen and hit the play like safari but now it just doesn t can you please fix this k thanks

len ratingone Where the hell are my bookmarks on this stupid mobile version of Chrome 
len ratingone Who is the asswipe who greenlighted this ridiculous bag of fail 
len ratingone Worse the stupid browser freezes and crashes 
len ratingone Guess I ll finally have to make the jump to Safari or Firefox 
len ratingone Unbelievable 
len ratingthree I love chrome for desktop but as soon as I switch over to this I lose so much functionality 
len ratingthree For example my bookmarks have no description so they are a series of small icons across the top of my desktop window but in this app they are just colored boxes with a letter 
len ratingthree Because I don t use descriptions I have no way of knowing what the random colors and letters are on here 
len ratingthree This is a HUGE barrier to usability 
len ratingthree It does the same when showing open windows on my laptop there is at least a description but once again it is simply a colored box 
len ratingthree Multiple windows for the same website are indistinguishable from one another 
len ratingthree I expected more from this app and from Google but no matter how often I try I continue to go right back to Safari because it works much better even without the syncing 
len ratingthree Come on Google pull it together

len ratingfive  Nice job don t ruin it 
len ratingfive Pretty good stuff 
len ratingone  I can t do anything within the app as soon as it opens 
len ratingone Everything I push just does nothing 
len ratingone Zero response 
len ratingone Have the latest update hard restarts etc 
len ratingthree I concurrently agree with lag time issues being of noticeable concern and on the forefront of user s reluctance to embrace Chrome on iOS or give it another shot since update issues being resolved in V But this review in particular had me wondering if the outdated info could sort of be a good thing to remind users of best practices in closing app data prompt further investigative measures for both users developers in understanding new session browsing list cmd code files how share features and rd party app functionality should equally be of concern to both 
len ratingthree I m sure a basic understanding of iOS and how AppStore stringency seemed to leave a bad taste in some Safari user s mouths but Android and Apple users can now see how Google Play and Google have a rampantly run wild playground 
len ratingthree I m not suggesting it s all a negative point of contention but perhaps a foolish notion on my part that Chrome is fastidious in continuously making itself a product as it touted it set out to be 
len ratingthree I too have noticed older app data and my user preferences effecting usage while browsing as of late and hope it s just part of the roll out while bugs and intuitive app behaviors adjust to step verification and one password measures 
len ratingone Fails to launch in s which results in a crash on launch on 
len ratingone IPhones
len ratingone  With the latest update the browser takes longer than usual to load 
len ratingone Also you can no longer play music from YouTube etc with the browser minimized phone locked 
len ratingone Bummer 
len ratingtwo If your looking for a good browsing experience just get a Samsung Ugh I won t load most sites and half the animations don t work plus I have to use this instead of safari to load gifs at all

len ratingfive  It s fast and reliable 
len ratingfive  Great source for everything use it all the time good source 
len ratingone  I use chrome on all my desktops laptops but for some reason Google has updated the app rendering it useless on ios 
len ratingone Pages take forever to load or don t load 
len ratingone I tried a reinstall but problem persisted 
len ratingone Had to delete and resort to using Safari which is so much faster although I hate its features but at least it works 
len ratingone The last update mid march has rendered this app useless 
len ratingone Pages don t load 
len ratingfive  App
len ratingfive Chrome has been essential for my everyday and is significantly better and easier than Safari
len ratingfive  stars
len ratingtwo  This is my favorite browser but recently opening closing tabs or doing anything in the browser takes at least seconds to respond I m uninstalling for now and try it again in a couple weeks
len ratingone  The back and forward buttons were accesible enough no need to add a swiping capability that can cause more issues than it solved 
len ratingone Now any swipe to the right can send you to the last page erasing any work completed 
len ratingtwo I need help 
len ratingfive  I use chrome for everything 
len ratingfive Very great browser fast efficient and updated 
len ratingfour  Good
len ratingone  Seems like the latest update has caused a glitch where chrome wants to load the desktop version of most webpages 
len ratingone Google searches Facebook news and many other of my most visited pages 
len ratingone Tried clearing cookies and history with no changes 
len ratingfour  Easy to use and helpful

len ratingfive It s fast can t beat it 
len ratingfive  Best browser on iOS 
len ratingfive Safe fast and secure 
len ratingone Pop up ad blocks everything unless you click ok to go to the ad 
len ratingone Afraid to use and risk clicking on something dangerous 
len ratingfive  I ve been a Mac snob for years now 
len ratingfive And as much as I enjoy all of my McIntosh products I found Safari to be a pain in the rear to use 
len ratingfive Chrome is just easy and dependable 
len ratingfive I would recommend with confidence 
len ratingtwo Fix app

len ratingfive  Incredible 
len ratingfive Fast to use 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  I love chrome
len ratingthree  Not as good as I d hoped 
len ratingfive  It s a osam browser 
len ratingthree  I was having the same problem of chrome not loading while on wifi 
len ratingthree It does load on data but not on chrome 
len ratingthree I have literally tried everything 
len ratingthree I rebooted my modem rebooted my iPad deleted my wifi from my iPad and then re added it 
len ratingthree Then today I decided to uninstall and reinstall chrome on my iPad and that seems to have done the trick fingers crossed 
len ratingthree I don t like using safari 
len ratingthree I have always preferred chrome and to have it not work is driving me crazy 
len ratingthree Google please fix it 
len ratingfive  Best part about this app is being able to switch tabs from phone to PC or vice versa 
len ratingtwo  I wish there was an icon view for the mobile bookmarks 
len ratingtwo It is currently a list view and makes large bookmark collections impossible to navigate 
len ratingtwo Love Chrome across all my devices but I keep reverting to Safari on iOS because of unavoidable ads 
len ratingfive  I hate safari on the iPhone 
len ratingfive This a better alternative 
len ratingfive Does the job and more
len ratingfive  This is the only ISO browser I use anymore 
len ratingfive It has been far better of an experience for me then safari 
len ratingfive My favorite function is you can use it in the background of other apps 
len ratingfive  UC 
len ratingfive I love the Chome app 
len ratingfive It s so much better than the regular google app in my opinion 
len ratingtwo This used to be a good but now constantly updates and a big power drainer 
len ratingfive  Good app 
len ratingfive  Genial
len ratingfive  IE 
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive  app
len ratingfive  The only one I ll use better than others by miles 
len ratingfive Thanks google 
len ratingone  ipad chrome 
len ratingone  Useless since last update 
len ratingone wont load pages so whats the point 
len ratingone  Since updated the latest version days ago and i only used it one or two times a day 
len ratingone  I loved your browser but your new update breaks a feature I have been using your browser for many years to enjoy playing videos audio when the screen was locked 
len ratingone This is great when I want to go to bed listening to something without killing my battery 
len ratingone In the past I used to be able to start playing a video in YouTube lock The screen and then allow the video to continue playing with the screen essentially off 
len ratingone Now whenever one tries to play a video and the screen is locked nothing happens 
len ratingone I am obviously very unhappy with the new update because of the single change 
len ratingone Please turn it back to how it used to be thank you
len ratingtwo I will happily revise my review to once the recent update bugs are fixed 
len ratingtwo For some reason the browser simply doesn t function with any speed or performance on wifi 
len ratingtwo I haven t been able to test mobile data since that has been slowed down for me but immediately after updating to the latest version the program slowed down so horribly I have had to switch back to safari as my primary browser 
len ratingtwo Waiting on a fix Google 
len ratingtwo Thanks 
len ratingone How can it be secure if google is tracking every single detail about me 
len ratingone Just go to your settings personal info and privacy and you will get option to deselect all these adds 
len ratingone  not working with wifi 
len ratingone major problem please fix 
len ratingthree  I like it
len ratingfive I like this app so much more than the default Safari that comes with the iPhone 
len ratingfive It s so easy to use 
len ratingfive Never had a problem with this app 
len ratingone  After the latest update I m no longer able to play YouTube videos in the background 
len ratingone I can t listen to something when using another tab or when using another app or even when just turning the screen off 
len ratingone That s the most heinous problem I can t even turn off the screen to save battery life or to avoid touching the screen accidentally 
len ratingone I assume this is some nonsense regarding YouTube Red but it s absolutely ridiculous to take away features like this 
len ratingone We re already stuck watching ads 
len ratingone I m fine with that 
len ratingone I m also fine with YTR content being stuck behind a paywall 
len ratingone But it s stupid to lock a feature that s been perfectly functional up until this point like that 
len ratingtwo  Why is there no voice changer on the app 
len ratingone The app doesn t work over wifi
len ratingone  Chrome is just too slow after a recent update 
len ratingone I blame the new read it later feature 
len ratingone Dreadfully slow but the same urls return quickly in Safari and Dolphin 
len ratingone Reinstalling helps for a couple of mins but then something happens and its back to being like dialup 
len ratingone Walk away and come back and it s still loading the page 
len ratingone Please roll back recent updates 
len ratingone I miss my favorite browser 
len ratingone Thought it was fixed with update 
len ratingone Tried to find a way to contact support 
len ratingone Wasn t successful 
len ratingone When I try to copy text it often freezes the page and I have to shut down app 
len ratingone I use this daily for my work and it s been frustrating 
len ratingone Not only does it freeze the page causing me to have to close app and reopen it also causes me to have to re sign into websites I was logged into 
len ratingone Please look into this 
len ratingone I d greatly appreciate this problem going away as it slows my work time down 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingone I love this app 
len ratingone Has been my go to browser for years but for whatever reason the wifi issues in the latest updates are a deal breaker 
len ratingone Please fix this soon google 
len ratingone I don t like using safari 
len ratingone  Chrome has always been my number one browser whether on iOS my Mac or PC 
len ratingone Unfortunately with the latest mid March upgrade Chrome has been rendered useless 
len ratingone Quite an achievement if albeit a dubious one 
len ratingone Pages not take eons to load if at all 
len ratingone Meanwhile Safari still zips along unaffected 
len ratingone Since Google has shown no sign that it even recognizes the problem nor whether it ever intends to fix it I cannot recommend that anyone use this browser or any other Google services or analytics for that matter at least for now 
len ratingone As a business how can I trust that anything else you are offering will be accurate or will even work at all 
len ratingone Please fix this train wreck of n upgrade as soon as possible 
len ratingone Until then sorry no Chrome 
len ratingfive  I m surprised at the low rating 
len ratingfive I was just about to send a message asking for support and realized there was an update 
len ratingfive The update fixed an issue that has been most frustrating for me 
len ratingfive I use Google Chrome as my main web browser 
len ratingfive I do a lot of copying of text every day as well as searching for the highest resolution possible of particular images 
len ratingfive As far as the copying of text there had been a bug that locked up the app when I began selecting text for copying 
len ratingfive I had to close the app and reopen 
len ratingfive Since my work involves a lot of this it has gotten very frustrating for me and cost me lots of extra work time and the inconvenience of having to re sign in to websites after the app crashed 
len ratingfive But this seems to be fixed 
len ratingfive I ll update if I come upon any other glitches 
len ratingfive I love Google Chrome for its many features 
len ratingfive I ve been using image search since it became available and that has helped me tremendously in my work 
len ratingfive Google Chrome was also the first to have the ability to have many windows open 
len ratingfive And that has been improved even further and made more stable through the updates 
len ratingfive Recently I had over ninety windows open as I work on various projects and go to many websites for info and copying text finding images 
len ratingfive It was completely stable 
len ratingfive I thought it might crash 
len ratingfive Nope 
len ratingfive I like the syncing of bookmarks the downloading of pdf s and ePub files the general ease of using the app and the other positives I ve mentioned above 
len ratingfive Thank you for continuing to develop this app 
len ratingfive It is a tremendous aid in my work and without it my work would be much more difficult 
len ratingfive I have everything I need at my fingertips and it helps me to get a lot of work done quickly and with ease 
len ratingfive Thank you Google 
len ratingfive I use this app on an iPhone plus iPhone s Plus iPad Pro iPad mini 
len ratingone  Just in the last month Chrome has become unbelievably slow on my S when I m connected to wifi 
len ratingone Any wifi home work airport hotel slow slow slow 
len ratingone When I m on cellular data it s fine but it s nearly unusable when on wifi 
len ratingtwo When double tapping the home button to show all currently open applications the chrome app displays really old web pages and videos I had open 
len ratingtwo It even happens when the original tab was opened in incognito mode 
len ratingtwo It seems to happen more in landscape mode 
len ratingtwo When I quit the app the information from my last browsing session or any browsing session before that should not be visible 
len ratingone The latest update has caused chrome to run incredibly slow 
len ratingone It can take minutes for a page to fully load while safari will do it within seconds 
len ratingone Please fix whatever caused this issue as chrome has always been more reliable and faster than safari 
len ratingone This was an amazing browser that I was accustomed to use exclusively 
len ratingone Now it opens into the pok ball icon and stays there 
len ratingone It freezes my iPhone 
len ratingone I know they ll fix this but for now I m stuck with Safari 
len ratingone Yikes 
len ratingone You can do it app team 
len ratingone Please get this fixed so I can use this amazing browser 
len ratingthree  Update I think I found a fix 
len ratingthree After reinstalling I turned off all tracking 
len ratingthree Seems to be working fine now 
len ratingthree  Chrome is just too slow after a recent update 
len ratingthree I blame the new read it later feature 
len ratingthree Dreadfully slow but the same urls return quickly in Safari and Dolphin 
len ratingthree Reinstalling helps for a couple of mins but then something happens and its back to being like dialup 
len ratingthree Walk away and come back and it s still loading the page 
len ratingthree Please roll back recent updates 
len ratingthree I miss my favorite browser 
len ratingone  Chrome no longer finishes loading pages 
len ratingone It hangs right around loaded then times out 
len ratingone This includes simple google searches 
len ratingone Absolutely ridiculous 
len ratingone It s been like this for the last two updates 
len ratingfive  Google com
len ratingfive  maybe it s a sensation but this versions looks fast at least on my iPhone s Plus iOS 
len ratingone The user interface is awful 
len ratingone Button placement is poor swiping to move back is slow and includes a needless animation 
len ratingone The app also forces you to have separate mobile bookmarks which are distinct from your desktop bookmarks 
len ratingone Google needs to take some design cues from their Google app and refresh this 
len ratingone Or better yet combine the two 
len ratingtwo Google Chrome is a very nice browser but the iOS version needs some work to make it perfect 
len ratingtwo To add to what other reviewers wrote I would love to see an option for a desktop style behavior with a traditional homepage that opens when I start the app 
len ratingtwo I don t want to see the last page I visited 
len ratingtwo If it s something important I ll save it to my bookmarks 
len ratingtwo I want all the tabs to close when I exit the app and have a fresh start each time I open the app 
len ratingtwo This the most annoying thing on all iOS browsers 
len ratingone  After many tests this version of Chrome is without a doubt useless while using wifi 
len ratingone Safari and other services work just fine on wifi 
len ratingone  Chrome is just too slow after a recent update 
len ratingone I blame the new read it later feature 
len ratingone Dreadfully slow but the same urls return quickly in Safari and Dolphin 
len ratingone Reinstalling helps for a couple of mins but then something happens and its back to being like dialup 
len ratingone Walk away and come back and it s still loading the page 
len ratingone Please roll back recent updates 
len ratingone I miss my favorite browser 
len ratingtwo  safari 
len ratingthree  Love Google and Chome is my favorite browser but for about a month or so the history hasn t been loading 
len ratingthree As a test to see how long it would take if I were super patient I waited about minutes which resulted in no change it continued to show the loading symbol graphic 
len ratingthree This is my only complaint though 
len ratingthree Please fix it 
len ratingone Since the update on March the performance while connected to WiFi has been abysmal 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone  Loved this app until I updated to iOS 
len ratingone Now when i scroll a word will highlight and the app crashes 
len ratingone Even after the latest update 
len ratingone I have sent numerous crash reports 
len ratingone I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app 
len ratingone It is pretty useless 
len ratingone I certainly hope they fix this soon 
len ratingone Got a new update on Dec and it is still randomly selecting text and crashing 
len ratingone This is now two months of being useless 
len ratingone Fix this now 
len ratingone It has been months and this easily reproduced bug is still a problem 
len ratingone Try to read a long article and eventually a word will highlight and the app freezes 
len ratingone Come on it can t be that hard to fix 
len ratingone Just got the update and the random selection freeze bug is even worse 
len ratingone Come on fix this 
len ratingone Pages load about x longer than Safari when on wifi but faster than Safari when using mobile data 
len ratingone Been that way since the update on March 
len ratingone This new version has the same issue 
len ratingone Used to use Chrome exclusively but can t use it like this 
len ratingtwo  The desktop version of this is obviously far superior but this was a very good app for a long time 
len ratingtwo Recent updates have started to ruin the browsing experience 
len ratingtwo My biggest complaint is that I can no longer play audio from a video after closing out of a video 
len ratingtwo This was my favorite feature in this app because it allowed me to play the audio from YouTube videos while doing other things on my phone 
len ratingtwo Once I can start doing that again I will change my review to stars 
len ratingtwo The app is really fast and responsive however the buttons are placed in terrible locations 
len ratingtwo The close all tabs and close page button are right where the new tab button is 
len ratingtwo I closed all of my tabs and I only got back 
len ratingtwo I would really pressure Apple to let google have the data compression feature on chrome again 
len ratingtwo But overall the app is really responsive 
len ratingfive  I will very happy if you add feature that lets you zoom in by double tapping and swiping up on the screen 
len ratingfive As the Opera browser has 
len ratingthree  I have always enjoyed using chrome browser unfortunately lately i have been using an alternative ever since it started crashing 
len ratingthree The crash has started a few days ago 
len ratingthree Upon clearing browsing history something that i regularly do 
len ratingthree Surprisingly the app crashed 
len ratingthree I tried running the app again and clearing my history but the same occurred 
len ratingthree Tha app simply crashed over and over 
len ratingthree Closing the app and restarting it doesnt work 
len ratingthree Restarting your phone does not solve the issue 
len ratingthree I just updated the app and the problem persists 
len ratingthree I m using an iPhone OS version Please fix this issue upon releasing the next update
len ratingtwo  This was a great app with all of the syncing and auto fill but lately it has been downloading data x slower than safari based on google s own Speedtest 
len ratingfive  So much better than Safari 
len ratingone Chrome will still not load webpages while on GHz WiFi 
len ratingone LTE G and GHz WiFi all appear to work fine 
len ratingone Please fix this issue 
len ratingone I ll be using Mozilla or Safari until a new update is released 
len ratingfour  Chrome was just too slow after a recent update 
len ratingfour I blame the new read it later feature 
len ratingfour After the latest update and reinstalling completely the issue is gone 
len ratingfour Back to enjoying it 
len ratingfive Cool app
len ratingone  I cannot believe another version has come out and the issue of unbearably slow wifi performance is still here 
len ratingone Chrome works fine on mobile data and all other apps work fine on mobile or wifi 
len ratingone It is just Chrome that s crazy slow in wifi like dialup speeds 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone You ve been my go to browser for years and now I m having to use Safari 
len ratingone Chrome no longer loads pages with any speed at all while on Wifi 
len ratingone The initial call take upwards of minutes to see any movement at all 
len ratingone No other installed iOS browsers I have can say they have this issue 
len ratingone Started probably updates ago and I hoped today s would fix it but no such luck 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingfive  I think that Chrome is one of the best searching utilities there is 
len ratingone  Every time you change for a minute to other app it reloads the page 
len ratingone Especially you feel it when you are in roaming or just out of the city and have a bad connection 
len ratingone Omg fix this issue 
len ratingone Every time I text wrap something it freezes 
len ratingone I m forced to open a new tab and there s no way to go back to the page I was working on 
len ratingone It s really annoying 
len ratingfour  chrome chrome 
len ratingone  I have been using Chrome for iOS since it first came out 
len ratingone Starting with updates ago on my iPhone s webpages stopped loading even google com or load extremely slowly while on wifi 
len ratingone If I turn off wifi they load fine 
len ratingone Safari loads pages with no issues and every other app works fine 
len ratingone I ve tried reinstalling Chrome and that did not fix it 
len ratingone Chrome is currently unusable 
len ratingfour Chrome is my default browser since it offers more functionality than others and is simple to use 
len ratingfour However since the last update the performance has decreased dramatically 
len ratingfour When connected to wifi it takes too much time to kid pages yet when using data that s not the case 
len ratingfour Please fix 
len ratingtwo Latest version pages are slow to load or don t load at all 
len ratingtwo Even once loaded the little gray wheel just keeps spinning and spinnning on each tab 
len ratingtwo Please fix and update 
len ratingtwo  vpn error
len ratingthree Will you guys add peek and pop function 
len ratingthree Only thing holding me back from using chrome again 
len ratingone  A very poorly designed app with lots of bugs 
len ratingone I downloaded this app to sync all my bookmarks across my devises but the app kept crashing when I tried to sign into my account 
len ratingone The UI was terrible and did not respond well to touch 
len ratingone  Crashes so much now 
len ratingone Switching back to Safari 
len ratingone Since I updated to IOS it has been crashing constantly 
len ratingthree Decent but it needs extensions and customization 
len ratingthree How about allowing us to move the buttons to the bottom of the screen where my fingers are 
len ratingthree Extensions though seriously 
len ratingthree Help make the experience more fluid between platforms 
len ratingone  Pages and content are very slow to load in this version especially when on wi fi but markedly slow even on strong LTE as well 
len ratingone Other browsers load quickly as usual under the same conditions so it s solely a Chrome problem 
len ratingone  Chrome is my default browser because I don t like Safari iOS used however the latest update beyond broke this app 
len ratingone Not joking or over exaggerating it takes on average minutes to open a simple web page and thats just for s of the images to show no text 
len ratingone Another minutes to fully load the page and then after that you have the spinning wheel going 
len ratingone Super disappointed that I HAVE to use Safari for the time being and I have to use data on my home WiFi 
len ratingone If I could give this VERSION stars I would 
len ratingone This app has gotten worse lately to the point where I can t even get google searches to load 
len ratingone It has been uninstalled until further fixes 
len ratingone I am now forced to used Safari 
len ratingone  Ever since the last update pages take an extremely long time to load for some reason 
len ratingone It s so bad that the google search app is loading faster 
len ratingone I m switching to safari until google figures this out 
len ratingone Super annoying 
len ratingthree Whenever there s a video it doesn t play it and just shows you a static image instead 
len ratingthree Opened the same page on safari and the video played smoothly 
len ratingthree  chrome 
len ratingone  I can t load any web pages on wifi all other browsers work but this one really struggles 
len ratingone This app used to be so good and it s just gone downhill 
len ratingone I m downloading Firefox 
len ratingone In the last few days Chrome is horribly slow and often won t even load a page 
len ratingone Safari is having no problems 
len ratingone  Since the latest update Chrome will not load webpages while on GHz WiFi 
len ratingone LTE G and GHz WiFi all appear to work fine 
len ratingone Please fix this issue 
len ratingone I ll be using Mozilla or Safari until a new update is released 
len ratingone  Has been my go to browser but something happened with the last update that makes pages load so slowly when on wifi that it s unusable 
len ratingone Back to ugh Safari I go 
len ratingone  Chrome no longer finishes loading pages 
len ratingone It hangs right around loaded then times out 
len ratingone This includes simple google searches 
len ratingone Absolutely ridiculous 
len ratingone  Latest update is extremely slow loading pages on Wi Fi 
len ratingone Loads fast over LTE 
len ratingtwo After a recent update performance has dropped when on wifi 
len ratingtwo It takes ages for a page to load but once you go back to your carrier s internet service it runs fine 
len ratingtwo Needs to be fixed ASAP as not everyone has unlimited data
len ratingone Sites slow to load and video pauses randomly every seconds 
len ratingone Unusable 
len ratingfour  pc pc uc ss vpn 
len ratingone  Chrome is my go to browser but it s just too slow to use now 
len ratingone Removed and reinstalled a couple of times 
len ratingone Works for a few mins and then it s like using dialup 
len ratingone Same urls on Safari and Dolphin don t give me trouble 
len ratingone Even Google queries don t return 
len ratingone I see others have the same issue 
len ratingone Please roll back your recent update 
len ratingfour  ios flash chrome 
len ratingone  This version is the first time I ve ever had a problem with Chrome 
len ratingone I can t even use it in its current state 
len ratingone Simply freezes then closes 
len ratingfive  I want to add shortcuts to my iOS home screen 
len ratingfive Chop chop 
len ratingthree  Something bad has happened with the last update 
len ratingthree My iPhone S has big latency while opening sites via Wi Fi 
len ratingthree Safari and other apps working fast though 
len ratingthree Ping and traceroute checks showing that there are no problems with connection 
len ratingthree And I m not the only one who is facing with such problem you can see through the reviews and find similar feedbacks 
len ratingfive  youtube chrome pc safari adblocks 
len ratingtwo Since last update I cannot reliably load pages when on wifi 
len ratingtwo The first couple pages will load extremely slowly but after that all subsequent pages fail with a timeout error or no internet connection error 
len ratingtwo I have a constant internet connection in spite of the error and if I go to Safari the pages load as expected 
len ratingtwo If I turn off wifi the Chrome will load all the pages but they seem to load slower than normal 
len ratingthree  Browser hangs when connected to wifi 
len ratingthree Safari does have the issue 
len ratingthree please fix 
len ratingone  I would use every google product if I could 
len ratingone But since the update websites that I have visited on a regular basis no longer load or take extra long 
len ratingone It seems to be the worst when I am using wifi 
len ratingone When I switch to safari the sites load immediately still on wifi I hate using safari but it actually works 
len ratingone  Loved this app until I updated to iOS 
len ratingone Now when i scroll a word will highlight and the app crashes 
len ratingone Even after the latest update 
len ratingone I have sent numerous crash reports 
len ratingone I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app 
len ratingone It is pretty useless 
len ratingone I certainly hope they fix this soon 
len ratingone Got a new update on Dec and it is still randomly selecting text and crashing 
len ratingone This is now two months of being useless 
len ratingone Fix this now 
len ratingone It has been months and this easily reproduced bug is still a problem 
len ratingone Try to read a long article and eventually a word will highlight and the app freezes 
len ratingone Come on it can t be that hard to fix 
len ratingtwo  Too buggy after iOS was released
len ratingtwo  I will be watching YouTube and then suddenly the videos pauses not due to buffering as I can see the video is loaded and at random thr video goes at x the normal speed this is annoying when I m watching long videos where it is hard to rewind to where I was before it decided to speed up 
len ratingtwo I ve dealt with this for a year now but the past few months it has been MUCH worse most likely because I decided to update the app 
len ratingtwo Please fix I ll gladly remove this review if this problem is fixed other then this one problem it is a great browser 
len ratingfour  When I am using chrome normally then it works fine but on low battery mode it will crash when exiting a website 
len ratingfour That s fine though 
len ratingone  Thought it was my internet connection but turns out it was this app on my iPad 
len ratingone Won t load pages but Safari will 
len ratingfive  Most of google services are great and this one does not fail it marries well with iOS
len ratingone Not sure what it is but something about this recent update causes my entire iPad mini to freeze especially if I am trying to use the on screen keyboard even in another app while chrome is open 
len ratingone Will be switching to safari until this issue is fixed
len ratingone Great browser 
len ratingone It is my default one 
len ratingone However the latest update takes forever to load webpage including Google s own news page 
len ratingone The same site loads instantly in Safari 
len ratingone Please fix it 
len ratingfour Great
len ratingone Chrome use to be great but recently started crashing multiple times a day 
len ratingone Too too too slow 
len ratingone I don t need stinking Google snooping everything I do 
len ratingone Please restore site login 
len ratingone ONE STAR 
len ratingone This version works fine on install 
len ratingone Then slows down until all pages load very slowly 
len ratingone Uninstall reinstall fixes but maybe time to go back to safari 
len ratingone  It won t load any pages 
len ratingone I ve installed and uninstalled several times and it just doesn t work
len ratingtwo  I used this app in place of safari I had no issues until today 
len ratingtwo Now the app crashes constantly 
len ratingone  The app has been rendered unusable since the last update 
len ratingone It moves at a glacially slow speed and won t load pages 
len ratingone  The app doesn t let me see videos I keep on resetting the app and deleting everything and still the app doesn t work
len ratingfive  Very nice
len ratingone  If you don t care at all about your privacy and want every thing you do on the web tracked recorded and analyzed then this is the browser for you 
len ratingone Google has made billions upon billions of dollars spying on users and collecting personal information 
len ratingone Chrome is just another weapon in it s arsenal against privacy 
len ratingone I m done with all Google products 
len ratingone This used to be my go to app for web browsing but recently it s been as slow as a turtle 
len ratingone Until this is fixed I REFUSE to use chrome 
len ratingone Goodbye Chrome hello again Safari 
len ratingfive  chrome google 
len ratingfive  RT
len ratingfive  Great application by Google 
len ratingfive This is my go to browser
len ratingfive  its very good
len ratingfive  Best Browsing app to have 
len ratingone A company with the resources of big G has no excuse for putting out such a poor version of its flagship product 
len ratingone This issue has been present across many versions on many apple devices 
len ratingone Google does not seem committed to improving it 
len ratingone Unacceptable 
len ratingone  No ad block 
len ratingone It s worse that it s ever been 
len ratingone Can no longer use sorry google
len ratingfive  Chrome is fantastic and I highly encourage everyone to have it on their phone 
len ratingfive I ve never had any issues with it 
len ratingfive  Google com
len ratingfour  Hey Google 
len ratingfour I was curious is you could fix the following on your search engine 
len ratingfour  On YouTube com its almost a struggle to scroll through your subscription list Can you make a setting were if you tap Request Desktop Site it will keep it even when you make a new tab Thank you for reading I hope you take these ideas into consideration
len ratingone  WikiLeaks exposed severe security flaws developed by the CIA 
len ratingone The CIA and anyone who gains access to these technologies can use our own computer devices cameras and microphones to spy on us even if the devices appear to be off 
len ratingone Apparently because of Google s financial ties to the US government they have refused to do anything to counteract these security breaches leaving all Google users more vulnerable than ever to surveillance even in our own homes 
len ratingone Mozilla the developers of the Firefox browser are taking serious precautions in order to secure their users private information 
len ratingfive  Works really well for me 
len ratingfive  It helps me run some of my programs better than other engines out there 
len ratingfive Buena por sta Google aunque deber a mejorar mucho con extensiones tal cual en la versi n de escritorio 
len ratingfive Easiest to use browser wish you could prefer it on iPhone so it didn t open every link in Safari which I undownloaded already 
len ratingfive This app makes me wish the Pixel wasn t Verizon exclusive
len ratingtwo  Always used this browser up until recently The flyout menu with new tab bookmarks favorites even report an issue etc no longer functions after last update Ridiculous that the option to even report a problem about the app to Google doesn t work 
len ratingfive  What makes it great is it s ability to sync up with my chrome account and thus with my browser on my PC Laptop and anywhere I log in with it so I can share and save history and browsing 
len ratingfive The interface is great better than the other iPhone browsers I have seen and whenever my iPhone crashes as happens on occasion chrome has a recover tabs option so I lose nothing
len ratingthree Seems to slowdown upgraded windows pc s
len ratingfive Best browser ever 
len ratingthree App will crash when i select a text
len ratingfour  Microsoft Edge browser for W is terrible 
len ratingfour Switching to Chrome was a no brainer 
len ratingfour Company web tools that failed in Edge written using Microsoft tools work fully with Chrome 
len ratingfour Just check ALL the settings options 
len ratingfour By default there s a lot going on behind the scenes you don t need that drain battery and share far too much back to Google 
len ratingfive Super useful best app 
len ratingfive  This app is perfect
len ratingfive  Great for the internet and emails
len ratingone Ever since the last update it takes forever for pages to load 
len ratingone I religiously use Chrome all the time but now I m forced to go back to using Safari 
len ratingone Google 
len ratingone Please fix I don t like Safari but it s working better at the moment 
len ratingone  The latest update does not work with chrome cast 
len ratingone Please fix asap 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed asap 
len ratingone Totally lame 
len ratingone It s your device 
len ratingone It should work with your app 
len ratingthree  I love chrome for its bookmarks and ability to work and work well on just about any platform from Windows to Android to apple however it s time to move on from the pull down to refresh option 
len ratingthree It reloads pages on me all the time when I m just trying to scroll and with limited internet connectivity it takes too long to reload or if you have to enter anything in the page it is then lost 
len ratingthree For this reason I ve found myself using safari more 
len ratingone The current version freezes when copying text from sites 
len ratingone This has gotten to the point where I have to open the site in Safari to do what I want 
len ratingone I m no longer using the Open in Chrome feature in other apps 
len ratingone Google does not care about you the user of any of their products 
len ratingone They do not care if their products work as advertised they do not care if they work intermittently they do not care if they do not work at all for you 
len ratingone It does absolutely no good to send feedback to them because they obviously do not bother to read it and if they do by chance read it you will get no response from them nor will your issue be resolved 
len ratingone To be absolutely clear here Google could not care less about you 
len ratingfour Chrome has been amazing but I think that we should be fully capable of moving around and organizing our saved tabs so for the next update google please give us back that feature other than that it s been wonderful
len ratingthree About a year ago I would give this app stars no question 
len ratingthree Now the maximum I ll give is 
len ratingthree After upgrading to iOS Chrome constantly crashes on my iPad losing all my work I do frequently 
len ratingthree Also this app doesn t allow you to add specific websites to an ignore list so stuff you do on them doesn t show up in history 
len ratingthree Speaking of history the app now only clears the ENTIRE history instead of a specific timeframe like other browsers 
len ratingthree When you clear individual tabs it still shows up in Recently Closed Switching to Safari until this is fixed 
len ratingone  Not sure what happened but this update has caused major issues on Chrome 
len ratingone It s been my default browser for years and now websites that I open daily don t load or take minutes to load 
len ratingone The same sites load immediately in Safari 
len ratingone In addition to that I noticed that when I use Chrome to browse it causes issues with my speakers using airplay 
len ratingone Skip this last update 
len ratingone Probably the most annoying option defaulted for use in any browser I ve ever used 
len ratingone At least make it easily disabled 
len ratingone I cant access any of my saved bookmarks from the last couple of days 
len ratingone Everytine i close the tab they are all erased 
len ratingone The only bookmarks that are still there are the ones before the update 
len ratingone Please FIX IT 
len ratingthree  I DO NOT LIKE THAT FAVORITE TABS WAS ADDED ON THE HOMEPAGE FOR ME 
len ratingthree Please change this 
len ratingone This update has been trying ok install for two days and I can t use it all while it s pretending to install 
len ratingone I use to use it daily because I prefer it to Safari 
len ratingone Now I can t use it at all 
len ratingone And when I try to cancel it won t let me 
len ratingone So now I m stuck using safari 
len ratingone Updates are only useful if they are helpful 
len ratingone Sheesh 
len ratingfive Good browser
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfour No Home Button 
len ratingfour Come on guys 
len ratingthree  Ever since the latest update when I load WSJ com or CNN com it loads the page and scrolls all the way down to the bottom 
len ratingthree This has happened on other pages as well 
len ratingone Since this morning s update from the App Store chrome does not work can t access new tab or bookmarks
len ratingfour  rt
len ratingfive I like the chrome iOS app
len ratingone  I thoroughly dislike this update 
len ratingone I have a lot of tabs open and I have them in an order so i can find stuff easily 
len ratingone Now when you open a new tab it automatically moves all your tabs and focuses on the new one losing your place with the old tabs 
len ratingfour  Thank you Google for adding the option to add pages to read later 
len ratingfour This was possible in the past before the app refreshed itself on start up and I m happy to see it s once again possible 
len ratingone  Fail cant load reddit com 
len ratingone Tabs on top is hard for large screen 
len ratingone  Pages don t load when I am using a cell data connection 
len ratingone Huge disappointment because I don t like using Safari where this is not an issue 
len ratingfour The Material Design is a little awkward for Chrome 
len ratingfour The bookmarks feature is terrible which is why I prefer Safari 
len ratingfour This app works really nice but are you guys chromecast connectivity option 
len ratingfive  ppt 
len ratingone  Used to love this app I don t know what changed but it s basically unusable 
len ratingone Just freezes and crashes
len ratingfour  I love using chrome it s a wonderful experience but it doesn t have the remove ads feature that Safari has 
len ratingfour If it had it I would use it more
len ratingone  Fail cant load reddit com
len ratingfour  Im soooo sick of browsing and hitting back where EVERY OTHER BACK BUTTON ON A BROWSER IS 
len ratingfour to have it DUMP all my work i just have been doing because it decides to kill off my browsing group 
len ratingfour STUPID ANNOYING JUNK 
len ratingfour Bad design 
len ratingfour Fix it
len ratingthree  chrome iPhone iPad ChromeSigninError 
len ratingone  The pages inexplicably scroll to be the bottom of the page 
len ratingone It is very annoying 
len ratingone I switched to another browser 
len ratingthree  Get iCab Mobile if you need a proper browser with all the things you d expect out of a desktop browser 
len ratingthree Extensive download manager that can send files to other apps handle zip rar etc fully adjustable UI modules plugins multiple windows gesture support and much much more 
len ratingthree Why aren t Apple Google and other big guys offering more then your barebones browser 
len ratingthree iCab keeps updating with new features going on years now if you want to keep it simple you still can 
len ratingthree Kinda reminds me of Windows Explorer vs Firefox and Opera back when no one barely knew who Apple were 
len ratingthree If you use your idevice for any productive work that requires handling files across multiple apps etc iCab is still king of the hill 
len ratingthree Will make your life easier working on the iPad or iPhone 
len ratingfive  Seriously 
len ratingfive Missed opportunity 
len ratingfive But I love the browser
len ratingthree Function isn t working 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingthree Why was this taken away 
len ratingfive  QQ uc 
len ratingthree  Certain websites like facebook are delayed when scrolling
len ratingfive  Love the fact that I can start a tab in my Notification Center 
len ratingfive Would also love it if Google Now became available for the Apple Watch 
len ratingone  APp 
len ratingfive  Can we drag a page in incognito 
len ratingone  I freaking hate it because i wanted to upload my assignment in canvas and in both safari and google chrome i was unable to submit because they could not show it 
len ratingfive Google always makes great stuff
len ratingthree  There s the physical web objects link in the home screen widget 
len ratingthree No matter if we enable or disable the physical web 
len ratingthree That stupid link is ALWAYS there and it always gets hit when scrolling down the home screen 
len ratingthree It s really annoying 
len ratingthree Can you make the opening of a link a one time only thing 
len ratingthree We don t need to go time after time to the physical web intro page or just remove that annoying link from the widget
len ratingtwo The title says it all 
len ratingtwo In the middle of browsing any type of website any of a myriad of swipes or taps causes the app to freeze 
len ratingtwo The only option is to kill the app and relaunch 
len ratingfour  Needs option to expand page to full screen mode 
len ratingfour Otherwise solid 
len ratingtwo  I have run into the app freezing causing me to force close and restart the app 
len ratingtwo Hope they can fix this issue quickly as this is my favorite browser 
len ratingfour  The only thing that I need to leave safari forever is the addition to reading mode to Chrome 
len ratingone  Why on earth would I want my tab to refresh on its own accord when switching tabs 
len ratingone I ll refresh it when and if I want it refreshed
len ratingfour Much prefer this to safari 
len ratingfour Hopefully it keeps improving
len ratingfive  ios 
len ratingthree  I would rate this app higher but it is SUPREMELY annoying to have to dismiss the translation popup EVERY SINGLE TIME a page is translated 
len ratingthree If I select to have a language always translated there should be an option to no longer be bothered by these popups 
len ratingthree I know you translated the page because I chose to have it translated 
len ratingthree Google please add this option 
len ratingfive  Write a Review
len ratingfive  Super quick and super easy
len ratingone  Please do more to eliminate sites or paths to sites of domestic hate groups or hate groups of any kind or place 
len ratingone I have deleted all Google apps until I read or hear that you have made a greater effort to do this 
len ratingone And I used to love Google 
len ratingfour Overall Google Chrome is amazing 
len ratingfour Very fast and secure 
len ratingfour However incognito is not as secure as you d think 
len ratingfour I find that if i am watching a video on chrome EVEN IN INCOGNITO if i lock my phone and then unlock it anytime the app is not actively running in the background and i m in another app with the screen in the same position as it was during the video portrait mode or upright then it shows the part of the video i was on when my phone locked 
len ratingfour This is problematic to say the least 
len ratingfour The only way to fix this is to uninstall and reinstall 
len ratingfour PLEASE fix this 
len ratingfour You d save me a lot of trouble 
len ratingone Freezes cant scroll up in many sites 
len ratingone Bad job 
len ratingthree  wifi 
len ratingfive  appp
len ratingthree  YTF can t we copy images 
len ratingthree No I don t want to save them 
len ratingthree I have enough crap saved on my phone as it is 
len ratingthree Allow us to copy images please 
len ratingthree Your app imo is superior to safari faster and less annoying to use but I use safari mainly because I CAN COPY IMAGES 
len ratingthree I DO NOT WANT TO SAVE THEM TO MY PHONE 
len ratingthree If you fix this very annoying problem you d have a star app 
len ratingfive  m m m m
len ratingone  Keeps crushing now
len ratingtwo Worked fine until lost all tabs 
len ratingtwo Also needs LastPass integration or support the native iOS ability to integrate with password managers 
len ratingfive  chrome chrome 
len ratingfive  PC 
len ratingone  Since the last update the app freezes a lot 
len ratingfive  Most relied on web browser on all my devices 
len ratingfive No other can compete 
len ratingfive Seriously 
len ratingfive The main reason is that I love that I can search for words in an article 
len ratingfive Otherwise it is the same as Safari 
len ratingone Crashes more than any other program I have ever used 
len ratingone The engineering team ought to be embarrassed 
len ratingfive  get post get 
len ratingone  Very slow and unresponsive 
len ratingone What happened here 
len ratingtwo  chrome ios bug ipad safari safari Safari Mac iOS chrome 
len ratingfive I love it so much 
len ratingone This app freezes way too much please fix
len ratingtwo It crashes every time I open it 
len ratingone  After the latest update Chrome often becomes unresponsive and freezes on many pages 
len ratingone I wouldn t be doing anything super intensive just browsing with one tab open 
len ratingone Closing and reopening the app doesn t help neither does a reboot 
len ratingone Very disappointing Chrome used to be my go to I m giving Safari another go 
len ratingfour Needs a reader mode
len ratingfour  The app is great 
len ratingfour The company tech support services however seem to be nonexistent 
len ratingfour It doesn t seem to be possible to seek out help for issues with the app that do not appear on the help page except to rely on the forums and pray to god that someone has any idea about how the hell to fix your issue 
len ratingfour Besides that though the app works well 
len ratingfour I would prefer however if there was a way to recover deleted bookmarks in the event that they weren t supposed to be deleted 
len ratingfour Not like a long term backup of deleted items but rather hours or less worth of backing up the deleted items before permanently deleting the data
len ratingone Why is it when I log into one of your apps you log me into all of your apps on my phone 
len ratingone I thought you were for our privacy 
len ratingone Crash Trash 
len ratingone Lost all open tabs 
len ratingone No restore option 
len ratingone Chrome crashed 
len ratingone Lost all open tabs 
len ratingone Google forum support official response was uninstall and reinstall 
len ratingone All app history deleted 
len ratingone Marvelous garbage 
len ratingtwo I have to constantly close the app and restart because Chrome freezes mid way of loading a link or the rest of an initial webpage 
len ratingtwo Please fix 
len ratingtwo This problem has persisted several months now started after one of the last upgrades bugfixes 
len ratingone Crashing constantly 
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingfour  ZF 
len ratingfour  not bad
len ratingfive This app is so much better than Safari 
len ratingfive The GUI and the design flows much much better than Safari 
len ratingfive Plus it saves everything flawlessly to your computer or anything else 
len ratingfive It never freezes and is much faster than safari 
len ratingfive I don t know where people are having it freeze but it has NEVER froze on me 
len ratingfive Honestly I love to use this web browser over any other one 
len ratingfive Definitely better faster and overall cleaner than Safari 
len ratingthree Slow to respond when first launching opening new tabs or using share send to function 
len ratingthree Settings Google Apps does not seem to recognize that Play Music is installed 
len ratingthree Latest Chrome and Play Music apps on iOS 
len ratingone F THIS I WANTED CHROME WEB STORE NEVER GOT TO IT THIS IS ALL IT SHOWED ME STUPIED APP DO NOT BUY 
len ratingfive  It s too good and faster 
len ratingfive But we want to add download options for videos 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive  Google chrome for iPhone SE works well for me 
len ratingfive No major issues 
len ratingfive I prefer its UI to safari s 
len ratingfive  Fb
len ratingtwo Full of bugs since latest iOS 
len ratingtwo Constantly crashing or producing display errors 
len ratingone  VPN 
len ratingfive  Apple should just give up on browsers and adopt chrome
len ratingfour  It s good but sometimes when I close the app and open it later on it shows the last website I was on so then everyone on the subway finds out I was jerking off to gay midget porn
len ratingtwo  Web pages load too slowly or not at all on certain sites 
len ratingtwo Little wheel on the top left of my ipad just spins and spins 
len ratingtwo I ve tried eveything 
len ratingtwo Chrome on my desktop and laptop works fine 
len ratingfive  Amazing
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive You re the best 
len ratingfive  It s the best browser for iPhone 
len ratingtwo Overall good but lose the ads 
len ratingone  The worst ever The worst ever
len ratingfive  The very best browser available 
len ratingfive It beats Safari hands down 
len ratingfive Google has the best voice recognition software so instead of typing your question just say OK Google 
len ratingone  I liked this app at first but every time This app gets updated it works fine but later on it freezes one too many times please fix
len ratingfive  I love it
len ratingtwo  Folks if you care about your privacy DO NOT DOWNLOAD this browser 
len ratingtwo Google s entire business model is built around collecting your browsing habits what sites you visit etc 
len ratingtwo Not only does this leave you at the mercy of marketing companies but it is information that can be used against you by hackers or local authorities 
len ratingtwo Chrome much like any other Google products will share data with corporate HQ 
len ratingtwo Look for Firefox Focus or other alternatives 
len ratingfive  It s freaking great 
len ratingfour Great app but can always be improved
len ratingone  Must have been recent update I used to be able to type stuff in search bar but now it won t work 
len ratingone Totally a crappy app now 
len ratingone Guess will go back to Safari 
len ratingfive  Don t see what all the fuss is about 
len ratingfive It works fine for me and always has 
len ratingfive  Lots of good features like the swipe to switch tabs feature QR code scanner from force touch etc 
len ratingfive As Always It s Google 
len ratingfour  This is my favorite web browser 
len ratingfour It is so easy to use and to understand 
len ratingfour I have no complaints about the app 
len ratingfive Clean simple and stable 
len ratingfive Just what I want 
len ratingfive  Est buena
len ratingfive it s just fantastic the integration and simulation of everything is amazing 
len ratingfive Google chrome the best ever 
len ratingfive  This is by far the best app to download on the market 
len ratingfive It s extremely useful and I now swear by google and google chrome
len ratingfive  I ve been using Chrome since Chrome came into existence 
len ratingfive I am quite a dinosaur when it comes to everything Google 
len ratingfive I have always loved as well as preferred I prefer Chrome 
len ratingfive Best Browser still February of 
len ratingfour  Wish it had better credit card auto fill capability 
len ratingfive  vpn 
len ratingtwo  In safari on iOS there is an option to open a new tab in split view 
len ratingtwo You all should add this 
len ratingfive  Love chrome 
len ratingfive Have never had any significant problem with the app 
len ratingfive Go Google 
len ratingfour  I mainly use this on my iPhone and I have a choice between Google Google Chrome or Safari 
len ratingfour Of the three I much prefer Google Chrome but it still needs improvements 
len ratingfive Let it be what it was
len ratingfive Google chrome the best browser simple and fast 
len ratingfive Very good 
len ratingfive Thank you Google But why it doesnt switch automatically adobe connect links to adobe connect app 
len ratingfive  Great site 
len ratingfive  Me gusta Chrome 
len ratingfive Lo uso en todas las plataformas 
len ratingfive  Personally I hate safari and this is a much better alternative
len ratingfive App works for me 
len ratingfive Excellent application
len ratingthree  There are a lot of things I don t like about this app 
len ratingthree Lack of customization is one 
len ratingthree I hate the swipey gestures for back forward as I tend to do them accidentally for example 
len ratingthree Another thing I dislike is how every time I open an incognito tab all my normal tabs are purged from memory and have to refresh 
len ratingthree On the whole it s a so so app 
len ratingthree It does most of what I want but it doesn t do anything particularly well 
len ratingfour  I like the incognito feature 
len ratingfive Great browser 
len ratingfour  Rarely have issues
len ratingfour  Password works with way more websites in Safari than in Chrome
len ratingfour  Better than safari but there are plenty of features that would be nice like tab duplication more D Touch integration and other QoL improvements 
len ratingfive  In Google We Trust
len ratingfive  I love it
len ratingone  Page loads black and freezes a lot more often than it used to
len ratingfive  You can easily play the audio in a youtube video in one tab and open another without the video pausing 
len ratingfive Great for listening to music or ASMR 
len ratingthree  I have no idea what s going on but the app isn t synching my bookmarks from my laptop 
len ratingthree Even when I re install both 
len ratingthree Hopefully there s an update coming for that 
len ratingfive I have used Google Chrome from PC to Mac and now on mobile phones and have lots of experience with this browser 
len ratingfive It is still in my utmost honest opinion the best browser to date 
len ratingfive Always up to date on security and features 
len ratingfive The speed of this browser including the desktop version is incomparable with other browsers 
len ratingfive Thank you Google for an amazing experience 
len ratingthree  I love the browser but late at night the current skin is just too bright 
len ratingthree A few browsers in the AppStore allow to darker skins to go easier on the eyes and preference please give us an option 
len ratingfive  Pretty good app if you like the internet
len ratingone  Just use safari 
len ratingtwo  Used to always use google chrome because I loved it 
len ratingtwo After last few updates search bar gives warning message of unsafe to proceed even when searching for google com or other sites I trust 
len ratingtwo What is the point of a web browser I can t use to search for things 
len ratingone Imagine you were watching porn in Incognito mode 
len ratingone You closed the browser 
len ratingone A day later your wife started Chrome on the same iPad 
len ratingone What do think she would see 
len ratingone She would see your handy work the last opened tabs and you thought you were incognito and no browser history would be saved 
len ratingone Not only that Chrome would gladly restore those tabs for you 
len ratingone I have no idea why folks at Google don t get it right 
len ratingone  Hi google chrome has been super slow and just doesn t work 
len ratingone I open the app and then closes by itself 
len ratingone I have to delete the app and download again and this has happened at least times within the last weeks 
len ratingone I had to switch to safari and they are so much faster and never have any issues 
len ratingone Please fix your browser 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingone  They took away the option to see the search results so you re forced to use the computer and give them more clicks
len ratingfour Pretty good browser but I wish I could use my chrome extension the app Like on desktop and if I can I don t know how
len ratingone  Can t even use Google search unless I m on wifi 
len ratingone Times out 
len ratingone I can use yahoo in chrome though figure that out 
len ratingthree  Of course the Gorg is biased as to which search engines are available as a default 
len ratingthree And duckduckgo isn t in the list 
len ratingthree Setting and using bookmarks and a home page is a hassle and inefficient 
len ratingthree Tab handling is a drag 
len ratingthree Some essential options require signin to the Gorg world 
len ratingthree I don t necessarily want to be known and tracked to be able to use the full power of the browser 
len ratingthree In short Chrome offered me no substantial advantage over Safari 
len ratingthree Why bother 
len ratingone google why to you all continue to make subpar apps 
len ratingone I m not able to access the desktop version of google docs because you guys constantly are trying to redirect me to the google docs app 
len ratingone The problem with the google docs app and the chrome app is that you can only do about of what the desktop versions can do 
len ratingone Access to the desktop version should be a option 
len ratingone I m a math teacher and having a equation editor is important to me 
len ratingone putting pictures in multiple places is important to me 
len ratingone For some people the google apps are just what they need for there line of business but forcing everyone to use it is only causing more and more people to use alternatives thanks
len ratingone I ve always been a huge advocate for Chrome but this version crashes every time I try to open a site 
len ratingone Hoping it gets fixed soon 
len ratingone  Though it may be partly that I use an iPad this browser is the WORST of the four I commonly use SLOW CRASHING no reader view bad linkage to Gmail even It s gone 
len ratingfive  What else is there to say 
len ratingfive It s the best browser out there 
len ratingfive  TG Google 
len ratingone  No custom date search in mobile 
len ratingone Absurd 
len ratingthree Please please add D Touch when opening links 
len ratingthree I find myself and I m sure a lot of others can agree with me 
len ratingthree Trying to D Touch a link to open it up like safari 
len ratingthree I ve started using chrome because I wanted something more different with great animations fast and fluid but the lack of D Touch prevents fast fluid also id like to see a system dark mode 
len ratingthree Not just in the mobile app but also chrome for windows 
len ratingthree Ease on the eyes 
len ratingfive  Lunch with the new of the family
len ratingtwo  Pop ups say click here to claim your free iPhone and the only way to get rid of it is to uninstall chrome and reinstall it 
len ratingfive  Best app ever
len ratingthree  Google makes it easy to use 
len ratingthree Used to use this for its private Browsing capabilities 
len ratingthree Even though it s on my own device I like it for that reason 
len ratingthree It s fast and it work great WHEN it s not freezing 
len ratingthree But it freezes every once a while 
len ratingthree It s great unless you like chrome themes and extensions 
len ratingthree But otherwise wonderful
len ratingfive  Phone E G 
len ratingfive brought me here 
len ratingone Stop with the annoying ads that cover content including the navigation areas 
len ratingone Even when u report how it covers content the stupid google banner stays covering the content 
len ratingone  The only good thing about it is it syncs my password and bookmarks 
len ratingthree Normally I like Google Chrome 
len ratingthree But the scrolling bar has a bit of an issue 
len ratingthree Sometimes when I first get to a webpage it immediately scrolls to the bottom of the page 
len ratingthree And when I try to scroll back up it sends me right back to the bottom again 
len ratingthree And some pages just flat out won t load at all 
len ratingfive  Works better on the iPhone than the stock app Safari 
len ratingfive Wish you could make it your default browser 
len ratingfour Very good
len ratingone  The new update crashes every time I navigate to a website 
len ratingone Not sure how that slipped by but it s bad 
len ratingfive  I downloaded this just because the offline t rex game
len ratingone  Says this update they redesigned the tabs but they are exactly the same as before 
len ratingone And the tabs toolbar still stutters freezes and finally scrolls off the screen every time you scroll down then stutters freezes and finally scrolls back on screen when you scroll up 
len ratingfive  Everyone knows Google is the best search engine out there 
len ratingfive Good job google 
len ratingthree When it actually works it s fantastic 
len ratingthree Since I ve downloaded the app it tends to freeze whenever I m using it causing me to close the app and reopen just to use it 
len ratingthree I also dislike that the telephone numbers aren t hyperlinked on pages like in the safari browser 
len ratingtwo  The release notes say QR is built in 
len ratingtwo Neither method to invoke QR works 
len ratingtwo They aren t even available at all 
len ratingfive  hgg
len ratingone Tried to renew license
len ratingfive  Quick and easy Enjoy my browsing I am a chrome fan and I enjoy using chrome for iOS on my iPod touch six generations Hope to see google update it soon It s nice and soft Sometimes I wish apple and google can cooperate together to make the world better Technology has changed our life thanks to the efforts of google and apple products One thing l would like to mention is l think browsers should be easy and good to use 
len ratingfive I don t like Microsoft edge because it s hard to use I am a boy from shanghai and my English is not well 
len ratingone  It seems the developers try to make things difficult for the Chrome Browser 
len ratingone Just today as I started to use Chrome Browser after using it before I was told I was supposed to answer a long list about me before using the browser 
len ratingone I did not intend to answer more questions but wanted to see all Google asked 
len ratingone I could not find anything ERROR THE PAGE IS NOT FOUND note 
len ratingone That s All We Know 
len ratingone I have found the nonsense before with Chrome Browser DELETE 
len ratingone Enough is enough 
len ratingthree Loads some pages and others won t load at all 
len ratingthree The problem is not my wifi or data
len ratingfive  Better than Safari 
len ratingone  fix this broken app 
len ratingfive  Love
len ratingfour  If you don t see QR code option try to close all open tabs that s how I got the option 
len ratingfour  For those who are not seeing the QR scanner using D Touch with compatible hardware uninstalling and reinstalling the app seems to have resolved this issue at least for me 
len ratingfive Chrome just got better love it 
len ratingfive For everyone complaining about not seeing QR scanner you need to login and setup Chrome as Google wants you to to gain access to it 
len ratingfour  QR 
len ratingone There current update to chrome no longer allows my iPhone to open the app
len ratingtwo  I have to close the app all day to reset it because features stop working on it 
len ratingtwo It hasn t been refreshing for the last two days and it s been freezing
len ratingtwo  Chrome was a good app but now when I look up news articles they force you to keep google com in the web address which makes it difficult to post articles on social media 
len ratingtwo I ve used them for years now but due to this I m deleting and trying bing and Firefox 
len ratingtwo Google is forcing itself on you and I feel like I have less power with Chrome now 
len ratingfour  QR 
len ratingone  For real 
len ratingone The last update is horrendous 
len ratingtwo  It s so hard to see which window is which with the pages overlapping perfectly with each other 
len ratingtwo I really do like how when typing up addresses in the address bar it brings up certain used functions above the keyboard 
len ratingthree  It immediately crashes on opening 
len ratingtwo  iPhone 
len ratingfive  You should really added Reader Mode and Data Saver Seriously 
len ratingfive Love the app but the qr scanner is nowhere to be found 
len ratingfive I tried d touch and spotlight 
len ratingfive Could really use it 
len ratingtwo  I updated but didn t get a QR code scanner
len ratingone No option for QR scanning with D Touch or Spotlight iPhone plus 
len ratingfour Is it just me or does the D Touch activation of QR Scan not working 
len ratingone  Safari on my iPad had become unbearable 
len ratingone Someone suggested chrome 
len ratingone It started out great what a relief 
len ratingone Sadly it s just as bad now 
len ratingone Crashes and or freezes all the time 
len ratingone Just like safari 
len ratingone Updated review I only use this because I hate Safari more 
len ratingone This needs extensions like ad block popup block etc 
len ratingone So many sites have redirects or ads that block out most if not all of the page that it s impossible to use virtually any news site 
len ratingone Plus Chrome quits working right a lot of the time and I have to restart it frequently 
len ratingone Using Chrome is like opening every email and clicking every link in 
len ratingfour I love this app the fact it links all my info and settings from my Mac but one thing when I m using YouTube on the chrome app when I come back to the home screen my apps and wallpaper are washed out for a few seconds then it returns to normal 
len ratingfour I m not sure if it s my s or the app but my screen has no damage to it 
len ratingone  Something has happened within the app recently where when it s open it drains my battery faster than any other app and my phone gets warm to the touch 
len ratingone In minutes my battery can go from to 
len ratingone I m forced to use Safari until this is fixed 
len ratingfour  The big thing I wish could be done is dragging and dropping open windows so that they could be sorted into your desired order like can be done on the computer version 
len ratingtwo  It would be nice if google web browser could connect with google chromecast 
len ratingfour  google bing 
len ratingfive  Miles better than Safari 
len ratingtwo  Tried Chrome and found it cumbersome for web browsing 
len ratingtwo Deleted and went back to Google 
len ratingone The mantra at Google is prioritizing the data mining of their individual users 
len ratingone The amt of outbound data they are pulling when you use Chrome is horrifying 
len ratingone I have begun removing Chrome across all platforms 
len ratingone It will only get worse 
len ratingtwo  Now it constantly crashes 
len ratingtwo I ve pretty much memorized the Aww snap error 
len ratingtwo  iPhone s Plus
len ratingthree  Not bad but on multiple occasions the screen has frozen causing me to have to delete the app and reinstall it 
len ratingtwo I love everything about this browser except this happens all the time ill be on a website and it s even all completely loaded I ll be reading a review or info about a product or whatever and the whole page will just vanish and the app tells me there was an error and to try reloading what the heck 
len ratingtwo Fix this and I will love this app and rate it accordingly 
len ratingtwo  This app crashes too much and downloads go black when I m trying to read them 
len ratingtwo It takes too long to load some websites

len ratingone  It s so laggy I can t do anything This is terrible It says it s fast But it s really Not My one word Garbage
len ratingfive  It cool you get to hacks games like pixel gun D
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingone  For about a year now this app has constantly been freezing 
len ratingone Currently when you try to switch back or select 
len ratingone It needs to be pulled and done right 
len ratingone Stop patching and re releasing without testing 
len ratingone  I personally think that there is a hacker in Google Chrome 
len ratingone Most people are complaining about when they are updating to iOS Google Chrome won t download 
len ratingone It s obvious that it s a hacker 
len ratingone Probably one working at Google right this second 
len ratingfive Nice application l have it in my phone long time every day i work with it really helpful thanks to all developers in this application 
len ratingthree  I gave it three stars only because it s much faster than safari when it doesn t crash
len ratingone  So I use this on my computer and I wanted to try it for my phone but it won t start when I touch the icon

len ratingfive I have no idea what these people are talking about 
len ratingfive Chrome is the best browser on the market I use it for years now both on my desktop and iphone 
len ratingfive It works great easy to use amazing options great touch features the best sync between mobile and desktop 
len ratingfive I hope it can already use the safari s feature that was only available to Apple s own browser only to make it faster than Chrome 
len ratingone  I downloaded the Google Chrome app out of curiosity as I use google com currently 
len ratingone Quite frankly I don t like the tab at the top and I also find it inconvenient to exit 
len ratingone With google com I just x out of it when finished 
len ratingone So now stop putting that annoying pop up ad for the app on my screen every time I open google 
len ratingone AND it s too slow downloading rd party sites 
len ratingthree We are in and still the mighty Google chrome doesn t have a reading mode It s ridiculous
len ratingone  You d think one of the leading web companies could create an app without pop ups 
len ratingone You would be wrong 
len ratingone Google App is the worst app on my iPhone 
len ratingone I have often just stopped using it to avoid adware pop up ads iTunes pop ups dead links etc 
len ratingone Avoid this POS 
len ratingone  I ve spent years trying to accept this crappy browser 
len ratingone It crashes constantly 
len ratingone I give up on google as industry leaders 
len ratingone  ios chrome iPhone ipad chromesigninerror win mac 
len ratingfive Chrome has been my go to for years 
len ratingfive The recent addition of a grid view option to review all open tabs made it perfect swiping through all the open tabs before was a horrible stain on an otherwise great browser experience 
len ratingfive Thoroughly satisfied 
len ratingfive Murillo
len ratingone  Only useful for jerking off
len ratingone  Can t do anything useful with the app 
len ratingone No way to view favorites or bookmarks 
len ratingone  How about when I click on a link it actually opens that page and not some proxy page that goes through Google 
len ratingone I don t think it s a lot to ask for my web browser to open a link 
len ratingthree  why have they not permanently added a restore last session option yet 
len ratingthree or even a open all history button 
len ratingthree especially since the app crashes alot and if you have dozens of pages wiped it could be fixed
len ratingfour I try to save the web page as PDF but there was no option for this 
len ratingfour Even the print is not active command 
len ratingone The latest version has so many issues crashes and freezes 
len ratingone Not the old solid Google product that I am used to

len ratingfour This mobile chrome app is great 
len ratingfour All i ask for are extensions
len ratingtwo This is more of a complaint against the iOS version iPhone more specifically more than anything 
len ratingtwo And my complaint is in regard to the FONT SIZE 
len ratingtwo I once had vision and could read small fonts with ease but age brings that to a halt 
len ratingtwo I have adjusted the font in iPhone settings but doesn t work well for individual apps 
len ratingtwo I know developers can add a font size setting b c the Life Church Bible app for iOS has it and it works great 
len ratingtwo So Chrome app developers PLEASE add a setting in the app to allow us something s to read it better 
len ratingtwo Millennials are not the only ones using your app 
len ratingtwo Thanks for your consideration

len ratingone DO NOT USE GOOGLE CHROME 
len ratingone IT IS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT 
len ratingone First of all it ALWAYS crashes 
len ratingone Always 
len ratingone But my most hated part about it and you will surely come to hate it as well is how it randomly deletes your bookmarks 
len ratingone I had numerous saved bookmarks I use all the time and need and Google Chrome randomly and instantly wiped them all out and I had no way of retrieving them 
len ratingone Needless to say I will never use a Google product again 
len ratingone I will delete Chrome from any computer or phone I use and will not even use gmail anymore because Google s products are such inferior garbage 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Why am I forced to sign in to my account whenever I want to search something on Google 
len ratingone I understand there s a google search app that I also have but I m not going to get out of one app to get into another that is essentially the same thing 
len ratingone It s arbitrary 
len ratingone I have never written a review for an app because my issues with a product have never gotten in the way of my experience 
len ratingone Usually these issues are patched out anyway 
len ratingone It s such a small thing and really I shouldn t care but for the love of basic etiquette let me sign in once on the app and leave me alone 
len ratingone If I want to search something and I m signed in already don t ask me to pick which account I want to search it under or if I want to open an incognito window there s a button for that already 
len ratingone If this persists I just won t use my google account for chrome or delete it and go back to safari which is a shame since I ve used chrome since it became available on iOS and was a Day adopter on my PC 
len ratingone It isn t fair it isn t right 
len ratingone Bookmarks I make on my laptop don t appear in the bookmarks on my phone 
len ratingone I even deleted the app and re downloaded it and it didn t fix it at all 
len ratingone Besides that it s a good app but the bookmark thing is just annoying and inconvenient 
len ratingone Constantly freezes and crashes 
len ratingone Highly annoying 
len ratingone I can t use this app until they fix it 
len ratingone With the work I use it for I can t keep force stopppng and restarting the app every minutes 
len ratingtwo  Chrome has been my go to for years 
len ratingtwo The recent addition of a grid view option to review all open tabs made it perfect swiping through all the open tabs before was a horrible stain on an otherwise great browser experience 
len ratingtwo Having added a better option then removed it has me severely disappointed 
len ratingtwo Seeking other options 
len ratingone I ve been singing this browsers praises for years but suddenly out of nowhere this app no longer works on my iPhone s 
len ratingone It will open freeze on the opening logo screen for seconds and crash 
len ratingone I rely on this browser heavily for bookmarks that I store on my other machines so it s a real shame this app no longer works 
len ratingfive  Google 
len ratingfour  D Touch 
len ratingone  When use vietnamese in address gchrome it error Example La b n la n Dantri com vn atri com vn Please fix it 
len ratingfive  That makes chrome worth it 
len ratingfive Nice work 
len ratingthree whenever I need to free up space on my iPhone it s the first app I delete 
len ratingthree Eventually I ll get frustrated with Safari and reinstall
len ratingone  This application used to be the best browsing application but it removed a wonderful feature 
len ratingone You used to be able to access all tabs open on other devices fairy consistently by using a button at the top right but this has been removed for no reason other than we cannot have nice things 
len ratingone This has turned a wonderful refreshing experience that was streamlined with my web browsing across all devices into just another identical browsing app 
len ratingone The innovation was patched out in favor of stagnation 
len ratingone Every time I open the browser or try to search for something on my iPad it freezes and crashes 
len ratingone For a multi billionaire company this is ridiculous 
len ratingtwo I really wanted to like iPhone Chrome because I use it on my desktop 
len ratingtwo It locked my iPhone 
len ratingtwo It does not have good design to move from tab to tab 
len ratingtwo Looks like I have to continue using Safari until someone fixes Chrome 
len ratingfive Why am I ending up with Google app when I m asking for Chrome app 
len ratingfive Is anyone home 
len ratingfive Many frustrated customers no response 
len ratingfive Don t think there s no competition elsewhere 
len ratingfive Really 
len ratingthree  The Chrome app crashes sometimes out of nowhere 
len ratingthree Very annoying 
len ratingthree And it seems like the button feature that enables you to zoom out and see all the webpages that are open as you can do in Safari is gone 
len ratingthree I was just using it earlier yesterday then it seemed like it disappeared 
len ratingthree Please fix this problem 
len ratingthree And block ups pop up using certain websites even though I have the no block ups tab switched to work 
len ratingfive  Facebook 
len ratingthree  What s going on with the apk freezing all the time 
len ratingthree At st it was just every now and then 
len ratingthree Now it s happening more and more 
len ratingthree Please fix 
len ratingone  The button to switch between incognito tabs and regular tabs just disappeared 
len ratingone WTH 
len ratingfive  AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaAAAAaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
len ratingone It won t download into my iPad 
len ratingone Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
len ratingone Please lower the rating 
len ratingone  In addition to my comments below a new problem began while I was still running iOS on my iPhone when the iPhone started nagging me to upgrade to where Chrome would just lock up 
len ratingone This happened to the point where it was just unusable 
len ratingone So now that the holidays are over I upgraded my phone to iOS and upgraded all my apps and Chrome just crashes every time 
len ratingone So I am giving it one star 
len ratingone It used to be my go to browser under iOS what happened 
len ratingone It feels like either Google is penalizing me for using an iPhone or Apple is punishing me for using a Google product either way I am quickly becoming turned off to both companies and their petty squabbles 
len ratingone Work together already or I might try Microsoft 
len ratingone My earlier comments still hold 
len ratingone  of the time if you try to select text the page freezes and no amount of reloading fixes it you have no choice but to open a new tab 
len ratingone This bug is forcing me to resort to Safari when I try starting Mercury and Atomic Web my other standbys iOS warns they are not iOS compatible 
len ratingone Google would you please add an easily accessible speak this page button 
len ratingone Having to select the text on the page using Apple s abyssmal touchscreen UI is like trying to prepare an omlet wearing oven mitts 
len ratingone Along those lines would Google please add a select all option to long clicking a page so you can copy everything to the clipboard ditto above on the horrors of text selection in this UI 
len ratingone AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
len ratingone Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
len ratingfive  IE 
len ratingtwo  Page loads black and freezes a lot more often than it used to
len ratingfour GONE SEXUALLLLLLL
len ratingfive  Does what I need it to do 
len ratingfive Never had any issues 
len ratingfive I do have to say that I recommend this app 
len ratingone  It crashes and or freezes way too much with iOS 
len ratingone It freezes when you highlight a word and I keep having to reload the app 
len ratingone Please fix this it s super annoying 
len ratingfour  Over all is is a good app 
len ratingfour Works way faster than Safari and makes it an enjoyable experience of searching things 
len ratingfour A few glitches where you get kicked off a website but Safari does that too 
len ratingfour I recommend this to anyone who is having a slow Safari 
len ratingfour Best of luck to using the app Lauren
len ratingthree  The app is pretty good simple and easy to use 
len ratingthree However every once in a while the browser won t play videos 
len ratingthree It just opens the video but doesn t actually play it 
len ratingthree I am using a iPod touch th gen 
len ratingfive  Just get this app it s actually really good
len ratingfour  I like using google chrome 
len ratingfour The only really annoying part is that can t sing in so I have nothing on here that is on the computer 
len ratingfive  jkjgdseuombcddtuoknbvdderyu vfdsweioonbfdswerghb
len ratingfive  I have used Google Chrome from PC to Mac and now on mobile phones and have lots of experience with this browser 
len ratingfive It is still in my utmost honest opinion the best browser to date 
len ratingfive Always up to date on security and features 
len ratingfive The speed of this browser including the desktop version is incomparable with other browsers 
len ratingfive Thank you Google for an amazing experience 
len ratingtwo  It s okay 
len ratingtwo I like chrome but why does the Google app autofill suggestions and the Chrome app does not 
len ratingtwo Meh 
len ratingone  Update iPhone version rarely crashes and have tabs open 
len ratingone Have to use this for school have failed quizzes because of crashes 
len ratingone Update Worthless 
len ratingone Can t even read an article without it crashing 
len ratingone Update A year after my first review this still has the same issues 
len ratingone Constant crashing only times daily now 
len ratingone Bookmarks are still exactly the same mess they ve been 
len ratingone Update Unusable 
len ratingone Crashes at least five times a day even more when I m studying 
len ratingone Bookmarks are a mess 
len ratingone Going to export bookmarks and use different browser 
len ratingone Google doesn t care 
len ratingone Before Sick of having to reboot daily 
len ratingone The update just made it worse 
len ratingone New update has made browsing painstakingly slow 
len ratingfive  I browse on this A LOT but whatever the most recent update did was not good because every time I highlight something to copy I am suddenly unable to scroll 
len ratingfive Once that happens I end up needing to close the app and reopen it in order to get the app working again please fix this
len ratingone  Website started to spam my phone with messages I had to uninstall the app wish this app had some kind of feather make it more intelligent
len ratingtwo I think the browser is fine except for one glaring problem 
len ratingtwo Previous tabs refreshing when you go back to them 
len ratingtwo Let me explain 
len ratingtwo I like to comment on stories on various web sites but like to open a new tab to check spelling of a word or research facts to back up my comment 
len ratingtwo Well this wonderful app likes to refresh the page when you tab back to it wiping out the five or ten minutes worth of work you have done 
len ratingtwo It has happened to me one too many times now so I give Chrome two stars until they fix this problem 
len ratingone  I love Google and I love Crom but here s my problem with this app on the mobile device It seems to use data much quicker seems to run the battery and drain it a lot faster than say other applications which is incredibly frustrating because I believe it s better than Safari yet it s still uses data much faster please fix the This 
len ratingone  vpn APEC is love 
len ratingfive  USB 
len ratingfive  app 
len ratingone  I rarely write any review but when i do it means that the product is too frustrating to use or too useless to handle 
len ratingone This Google app to be fair is not a bad app 
len ratingone It s quick in loading data and friendly in design 
len ratingone However there are still some issues that decimates my positive experience with this app to substantially 
len ratingone For an example the app is too SENSITIVE the moment i sweep my finger over ads on the news it automatically redirect me to the ads attemps 
len ratingone i try to cancel the loading process but instead of activating the cancel button symbol x in most other browsers on the address bar it turned out to be the closing tab button and as a result i have to enter the website address and look for the previous article all over again 
len ratingone What a confusing stupidity 
len ratingone Keep in mind that your browser is not the only one out there 
len ratingone I for an instance use different browsers for different purposes operal for storing crucial websites safari for security purposes and Google chrome for entertainment 
len ratingone Be sensible when you make new product And what is the difference between this Google app and Google chrome 
len ratingone  When I go into incognito mode and completely close that tab for some reason at random times when I open up the app it shows the page for about seconds before going into default page so much for secret mode the app needs a major update 
len ratingone I only notice this issue when I switch to the iPhone 
len ratingthree  I still can t believe that google didn t bother to add Chromecast support on iOS 
len ratingone After Google felt they had to incorporate Apple s WKWebWhatever into their app they broke what had been a great browser 
len ratingone Tabs Aw Snap regularly and the app 
len ratingone itself crashes at least every few days 
len ratingone Many of us have to return to Safari when pages repeatedly fail to load properly 
len ratingone Heads should roll at Google for this kind of substandard baloney 
len ratingone It s been months since this thing worked the way it s supposed to
