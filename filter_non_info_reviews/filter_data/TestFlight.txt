len ratingfive Great app this is what the world been missing

len ratingfive I did a couple guided meditations for sleep and they are very relaxing 
len ratingfive I love the calm male voice 
len ratingfive His tone and clarity are perfect 
len ratingfive The phone vibration was great and really gave you an added sense of being in the moment 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive great
len ratingfive Excellent App

len ratingfive OK How can I describe this app Excellent It meet my need in truly To sum up it will be better The words above of all is my own opinion of this app 
len ratingthree So u can be on any age what if a year old downloaded this and no what do you doing 
len ratingtwo Could you even imagine that devs products and QAs may have multiple iClouds 
len ratingfive illumineX is super thrilled to see TestFlight for macOS 
len ratingfive We love TestFlight for iOS because it helps us manage the beta testing cycle and get feedback on product qualty from a larger audience 
len ratingfive Get on the TestFlight bandwagon 
len ratingfive macOS app testing rocks 
len ratingfive In the way that working out stresses your muscles flexing my brain through these exercises feels like a solid neurobic workout 
len ratingfive Unlike a lot of other brain puzzles it s building skills I can apply elsewhere in my life 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Finally we have a way to access pro photographers and receive critiques on our work 
len ratingfive Thanks for providing this 
len ratingfive Using the app made all the difference in this tour 
len ratingfive Wonderful explanations and really liked the D models that appear 
len ratingfive Very interesting 
len ratingfive It is a great walk for a family excursion 
len ratingfive Highly recommended 
len ratingone It clearly states that it s ages and up but after you download it you can t use it until your 
len ratingone The app constantly is on the fritz 
len ratingone Multiple times a week it will freeze and not open saying internet connection but all my other apps open 
len ratingfive  I can now let the developers that I am back and we can continue working together in making a better product 
len ratingfive I have always enjoyed working with others 
len ratingfive Hardware and Software are my pride and joy 
len ratingthree Very useful very powerful but very confusing UI
len ratingone  After installation it asks for an invite from the developer by using a link from an email or entering a redemtion code 
len ratingone I have not received an email or any sort of redemption code making this app useless to me
len ratingone I used this app for Bilaxy and they took my crypto shut down my account customer service dose not exist 
len ratingone Don t get
len ratingfive Very helpful in checking out a new app 
len ratingone Won t let me do anything until I get invitation code from the app developer
len ratingfive Need exactly where there s copycat 
len ratingfive I don t see it 
len ratingfive It s a good app for beta testing
len ratingfive Plz needs code
len ratingone  Not working
len ratingone So I trying to connect and will not let me be you not available
len ratingfive Invitation code please
len ratingtwo Poor connection
len ratingfive Love using the mobile app to cut my designs 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive C mo Lombriz
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone it won t let me test or connect to anything it is telling me i need a code that i don t have 
len ratingone TestFlight process is a pain
len ratingfive Best Golf App no eraser needed 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Everyone had a great time with this game 
len ratingfive Some had only ever played board games and got on with it right away 
len ratingfive Others were video game veterans who took to it almost immediately 
len ratingone I m trying to use the app and they are said it full and don t accept new user
len ratingone There is an expiration error
len ratingfive Seed
len ratingone I just can t do a single thing on this app 
len ratingone when I installed it it said that they re were no apps I can view 
len ratingone Please fix this problem 
len ratingfive Cndndn
len ratingtwo There is nothing here to do all apps are full and the one I want to play because I already play it on android says it s full 
len ratingtwo Useless
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingfive Buen simo
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Very intuitive 
len ratingfive Whoever wrote this app must be a genius 
len ratingfive I find my life partner through it 
len ratingfive Trato de entrar a la app y me pide un c digo del desarrollador 
len ratingone I am expected to have an invitation code from an email I received years ago 
len ratingone And there is no obvious way to resend that code from AppStore connect 
len ratingone This UX is brutally bad 
len ratingone Send me a code to test Axie Infinity and a change my opinion about this not intuitive app 
len ratingfour The developer removed you from the test program 
len ratingtwo After installing it doesn t ask for who to send to 
len ratingtwo It just redeem an email which is ridiculous 
len ratingtwo That should be for others who get emails not the developer who has Xcode open and wants to send it out to friends family thru Testflight 
len ratingtwo I find this another example of Apple half baked software 
len ratingtwo How about they focus on fitting normal use cases such as when the develop downloads the app and cannot do anything with it 
len ratingfive I enjoy being a beta tester and would do again anytime
len ratingfive Finally a company that understand s privacy and encryption on a higher level 
len ratingfive Super fast and reliable service 
len ratingfive Technicians are great as well 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive This is best way to take notes Record thoughts and everything of the lake including drawing diagrams etc This platform gives you an opportunity to record what your thoughts are or what other people are saying In real time 
len ratingfive I wish I had this since the first time I ever took notes and had a pocket tape recorder to record dictations 
len ratingfive I can hand write my text and then copy and paste it as printed text elsewhere 
len ratingfive For the time I have participated in the beta program testing 
len ratingfive I would say it had been an amazing and nice expressing journey so far
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive After I open testflight it go to coinmicro is everyone like this but I didn t see Any information from Coinmicro from google or anywhere is Coinmicro is fake 
len ratingfive Kuwait City good
len ratingone Well so much for that 
len ratingone I tried to use it and it told me I was too young 
len ratingone I m 
len ratingone But I got my son an iPad and we share it for diff things it has a lot of space to keep apps unlike my phone and I can t do much of anything because somewhere along the lines it found out he s although I created a whole new Apple ID and specifically said it was my birthdate etc 
len ratingone it still found out he s 
len ratingone So this app blocks anyone under 
len ratingone Like a lot of apps 
len ratingone But it s annoying and no one takes into consideration that families share devices 
len ratingone So they still put this age restriction on their apps so if you ever I m guessing set up child screen time or let you kid have their own Apple ID and was honest about their age 
len ratingone Or it somehow found out the person mostly using it is your screwed out of a lot until that child finally turns 
len ratingone I ve had this problem for years but finally I have more months before the device and age restricted apps recognizes me as anyone older then 
len ratingfive I have been a podcast host for a decade now this is game changing 
len ratingone Hi when I download the app it s Basically giving me a blank screen with only a redeem option on the upper right hand corner of the screen however I don t have an invitation code how can I get one so I can use the app 
len ratingone TestFlight won t download app 
len ratingone I am using a link that I understand others have used 
len ratingone TestFlight doesn t provide adequate feedback and information about the failure 
len ratingone Dont allow me 
len ratingfive Gonna try this out
len ratingfive Fino
len ratingone I can t make it work I have no code to redeem nothings been sent to me 
len ratingtwo Intrusive interruption asking for a review so here it is 
len ratingtwo Please stop this disruptive UX anti pattern 
len ratingtwo Apple especially should know better 
len ratingtwo TestFlight is otherwise fine 
len ratingtwo Honestly it d be an easy star we re it not for the extremely annoying bit that triggered this review 
len ratingtwo It s not letting me in glitch already
len ratingfive Open back ZiniTevi app
len ratingone Low budget and no help disappointed 
len ratingtwo Why do you need a freakin age restriction all I am trying To do is play beta games I have been trying to play 
len ratingtwo  Please fix 
len ratingone I signed up to help with this beta testing that I was really excited to try out and of course I can t use it since the code that was given to me has letters that the app won t take 
len ratingone What nonsense is this 
len ratingfive Easiest way to check my credit and I love when I get surprised with the instakarma
len ratingfive Love this app got into a car wreck and my family found me easily and got me home safely thanks to this
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfour Headache free set up under minutes and secure encryption leaves confidence knowing you won t open ports while data collection software is active 
len ratingone It seems like apple doesn t check to see if the application they allow for testing on test flight is legitimate 
len ratingone We got scammed from a developer thinking it s a investment app but it turns out a scam and just took our money 
len ratingone It s been extremely difficult to work with TestFlight since the latest iOS update 
len ratingone It makes it very challenging for dev teams to continue to improve and test apps 
len ratingone It ll be great to have this fix soon 
len ratingone Attempting to joining a Beta test group for an app and have been troubleshooting for two days with this app 
len ratingtwo Processing is confusing no instructions
len ratingone I can review without an Invitation code 
len ratingfive  kena 
len ratingfive Worlds best app just wow loved it
len ratingfive world s best app my most favourite app ever 
len ratingthree Application did not install successfully 
len ratingthree Needed to restart the entire process 
len ratingthree Big failure as far as I m concerned 
len ratingone Don t fall for it 
len ratingone It s all a scam 
len ratingone Now they HKEX have my identification information and tried to get me to invest into their fake beta app smh I never invested but my friend invested to get to the tier of partner dividends they never let him withdraw smh Trust your instincts people 
len ratingone If it sounds too good to be true it probably is 
len ratingone Stay away
len ratingfour To good 
len ratingfive Banihashemi
len ratingone Es una estafa no instalen esto 
len ratingfive Enjoy very much 
len ratingone I need help or I m just burnt how u use this app or what s the code thingy

len ratingthree Beta version was extremely interesting but when construction occurred along the route the app is not flexible enough to quickly show the times for the new route

len ratingfive Be honest who didn t install this because of tiktok
len ratingfive I would love to review videos because some get taken down for no reason when jealousy comes into play and some need to be taken down be cause of community guild lines people need to know the difference I ve worked in the public eye for many years

len ratingthree Don t like this app much 
len ratingthree It expires without warning and then stops working 
len ratingthree I have to delete app and downloaded another one 
len ratingthree Irritating as heck
len ratingthree I really liked the app until I realized the features that it says that you can use you can t every time I try to upload to change the colors or the style it says error 
len ratingthree I don t understand the reasoning for this in the beginning I was able to now I can t also Little bit more features that you can actually use since this is a new app hopefully you guys get it figured out
len ratingfive So far I am loving this app 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone It says the beta is full and it s just being dumb

len ratingone Too complicated 
len ratingfive Very Good lack of communication but normal 
len ratingfive The foreign aspects are very important but aggressive

len ratingone I have emailed with questions and have received no response from them and I am incredibly disappointed 
len ratingone I cannot purchase coins on TikTok 
len ratingone It says cannot purchase in a test environment but when I download the test flight app it says removed by the developer so I don t recommend this app it will screw up your other apps 
len ratingone I would love someone to fix this for me no one from TikTok answers and Apple says it s them 
len ratingfive Great app

len ratingfive I love the app helps me not to have to remember to turn them off after I fall asleep night

len ratingfive SaraviA
len ratingfive App not available on TestFlight need redeem code
len ratingfive There is a learning curve in the App Store for uploading betas but once you figure out that works TestFlight does the job and makes it easy to distribute versions to testers 
len ratingone I wish it would update the app version automatically or let users know when their version is out of date 
len ratingone Instead of me getting frustrated that the apps that I m trying to test don t APPEAR to be up to date so I have to go thru the whole process of getting the tester app again 
len ratingone Often times the updates are not complete on that version anyway and quickly go out of date without alerting the user 
len ratingone The process of downloading the test app also glitches the whole time and your apps freeze and restart over and over throughout the process 
len ratingfive Love tick tock just wish they would stop people from bulling me
len ratingfive Thanks guys gals for letting me test out all the fresh stuff coming out in the crypto industry I love to see what you all come up with and it s fun to be one of the first to get to test it out Thanks for your hard work and awesome ideas

len ratingfive Steve Irvin is my father

len ratingfive And if I have a question I just text the inventor and he responds in hours 
len ratingtwo I assume it is a good app but no I cannot use it it keeps saying unavailable but it says and when I go in now it s say and i just want to use it that s why i rate it a two star
len ratingone How do I even sky 
len ratingfour There were no instructions what to do post beta

len ratingfive loving the beta 
len ratingfive The app was very easy to use and I had no crashing problems so far 
len ratingfive I m extremely pleased with the adequacy of the app as well and the quality of it 
len ratingfive I connected the app with another app called POGO and I thought I would have some problems with that but it was very quick to install and connect as well 
len ratingfive I would recommend this app to my friends and family to use 
len ratingfive Very good application 
len ratingfive Love yall
len ratingone TestFlight UI is not user friendly 
len ratingone When you receive a TestFlight email you don t even know it s an Apple product 
len ratingone Many people trash it as a result 
len ratingone Then you have to click to get a redeem code but nowhere are you told this

len ratingone I ll probably delete 
len ratingone What s the point 
len ratingtwo When TestFlight was owned and operated by its founders it was a great tool 
len ratingtwo It was intuitive and functioned as expected

len ratingthree It have to fully detail precisely the steps that I am taking since I can t show an example 
len ratingthree Other than that pretty cool to be able to provide feedback

len ratingfour Clear was sold a year or so ago to a new company who put it into development but made it available in a limited form in beta 
len ratingfour TestFlight reliably renews my access to the beta release every days

len ratingfour One thing that would be better would be if it was easier to point users to older builds as we often have alpha and beta releases going at the same time 
len ratingfive I think that this a game changer for me 
len ratingfive I like the layout and ease to operate 
len ratingone Didn t let me put my email in to redeem the code to log in and now it s stuck where it says redeem code 
len ratingone Need to fix it 
len ratingfive I have copied hundreds of documents with this app 
len ratingfive It has never let me down 
len ratingfive I have used it to copy my kids homework 
len ratingfive Sharing this with other parents has made life easier 
len ratingfive I had a problem but I had a response within hours That was fast 
len ratingfive So easy 
len ratingfive  star best app ever i have never seen best like this public every one to test
len ratingone The app is basically unexplainable 
len ratingone I wouldn t be able to tell people how to use it 
len ratingone It won t allow be to go assign a redeem code on my email it just stays on the same page 
len ratingone Never was given a redeem code
len ratingone  id id vpn 
len ratingone This will not woke
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive Money man
len ratingone SO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THUS 
len ratingone I GOT THIS APP FOR TIKTOK TO BE A BETA TESTER BUT I NEVER GOT ANYTHING
len ratingfive  This is the best app I ve ever been on and tbh I really don t know why I m writing this review bc every one already knows this is the best app in the world and not to forget the best app in the world
len ratingone I wanted to use this app to beta test the peoples game however I can t use it cause I must be but in the App Store it says or older
len ratingone I m unable to even get the code so I can start
len ratingfive We LOVE IT 
len ratingfive Especially the ability to test our app with over fans before we fully Launch 
len ratingfive This is the best app for developers who want customers to try before they buy 
len ratingfive Can stop saying this but we LOVE IT 
len ratingfive Solid App get timely EBird beta updates and interface for comments is clean
len ratingfive Excellent app it would be hard to be without it Thanks for all the hard work
len ratingfive Brand new at using but so far it s right on spot 
len ratingfour If I had actually features to test or was getting feedback from the developers on specific bugs or what have you they need information on 
len ratingfive This is a great companion app to something like James Nestor s book Breath This is highly recommended 
len ratingfive Had a great afternoon playing this game
len ratingtwo I think this is a generally dumb way to test apps 
len ratingthree Prompted me to review it in the middle of trying to accept an invite
len ratingfive I need a invitation code please I used this app a bit ago but I got a new phone and now it s not working can I get a invitation code please
len ratingfive The app is easy to use and works well 
len ratingone Why do you need to ok be to use
len ratingone You can only use the app if you re and I don t see any valid reason for that 
len ratingtwo Apple was very late years too late with this tool 
len ratingtwo a very practical tool finally 
len ratingtwo however quite unstable dysfunctional it only works if eMailed invitation to be test user is sent to same eMail as your SmartPhone ID eMail 
len ratingtwo  even then it does not always recognize latest app build and you re stuck with last build or nothing new to test 
len ratingfive  This app has made such a difference in my mindless social media scrolling during the day which has in turn made me more productive and simply happier because I m spending less time on my phone 
len ratingfive Even though the irony is I m using my phone to help me be on my phone less 
len ratingfive Definitely an app worth having 
len ratingfive  Having your pool light and waterfall light change colors is beautiful 
len ratingfive It s even better when you can change color and turn them on and off from your cell phone 
len ratingfive The light has about different colors and you can choose to make it change or stay on your choice of color or fade into other colors or just change at random to another color 
len ratingfive Having the water fall with the light behind the fall of the water makes it sparkle 
len ratingfive It definitely makes your pool more than ever beautiful at night 
len ratingfive The people at ASP American Swimming Pools have what you need to get this for your pool 
len ratingfive If you want something other than a White light in your pool I recommend getting this 
len ratingfive It comes with a controller and an LED light and pool LED light 
len ratingfive Enjoy your pool water change colors

len ratingthree Good app
len ratingfive This application is what we need for the third party apps to keep up to date 
len ratingfive Great work I like 
len ratingfive We appreciate if there are more apps like movie box Kodi and other tweeted apps
len ratingfive Vv
len ratingfive Porque en esta pandemia Tik tok fue y es la aplicaci n de entrenamiento mejor que todas las redes sociales que tengo 
len ratingfive It s TestFlight 
len ratingone  While I do like the idea of of a sorta hub app where it has all your apps you re beta testing in one place it s very flawed outside of that function and is over all very counterproductive 
len ratingone For starters let s talk about how you even get to beta tests apps 
len ratingone Contrary to what people who re new to iOS may believe when they discover this app you don t get to pick and choose which apps you get to beta test and see what apps are available for you to even test 
len ratingone In order to do that you have to go online and search for it or find it in the app you re trying to beta test and it will take you to some external webpage so you can even register for the beta 
len ratingone The problem with this is not ever app has a beta program or has a TestFlight app to even test 
len ratingone Not every developer even bothers putting in a menu or setting in their app that even tells you that you can sign up 
len ratingone So the best way to even get signed up and test apps is to search for them manually and then click on a link on that webpage for you to finally get that app you want to beta test 
len ratingone That s a lot of tapping typing and scrolling that you gotta do when it s not even necessary 
len ratingone Ideally all TestFlight apps should be compiled into a list and you just pick and choose which apps you want to test but that s asking for too much apparently 
len ratingone It makes it worse when you check to see if an app has a TestFlight version and the beta is full and it would be months till more spots are available for others to register to even test the app 
len ratingone To make things worse sometimes you ll be randomly removed from an apps beta program for no apparent reason and you re not notified about it or given a reason as to why you got removed but you are allowed to rejoin the program repeatedly 
len ratingone One app that s really bad with this is TikTok and it s TestFlight program 
len ratingone It s terrible 
len ratingone Every day I get removed for the beta program for no reason 
len ratingone A lot of times I ll rejoin after being removed and then go to sleep and I wake up the next day to find myself move because I was inactive or I m not eligible but the TikTok TestFlight app is open for anyone to register and test so I don t understand why I m being removed constantly 
len ratingone I give feedback whenever I can and I m not nearly as active as other TestFlight apps I m testing and I don t get removed everyday 
len ratingone Make it make sense 
len ratingone Then there s the issue of developers not pushing out new builds consistently 
len ratingone Some will wait till the very last minute or even past when the build is supposed to expire to push out new builds of the app they want people to test but will often update their official builds much more frequently than their beta builds 
len ratingone This is more of a minor gripe because I personally don t care that much about how frequently builds update unless developers release a build that you can t even test because the app is constantly freezing or crashing 
len ratingone TestFlight as an app itself hardly works half the time either 
len ratingone It will crash from time to time even with the option to auto update builds enabled I still have to manually update my TestFlight apps hours after a new build is released I get logged out occasionally and can t log back in get stuck on the loading screen frequently etc 
len ratingone In a sense all this app really does is make things more complicated than it needs to be and gives you more headaches as both a tester and as a developer when really all that s necessary is a section on a apps page allowing you from download the beta version of said app 
len ratingone Some TestFlight apps are invite only and unless you re special there s no way you can test those apps even when you could provide insightful feedback 
len ratingone Again a nice concept but fundamentally flawed 
len ratingone It would be better just to have a dedicated section to a beta version of the app on that app s page on the App Store like everything else specifically like privacy since Apple seems to put more care into a section about privacy than the overall UI of their apps and App Store but like many other things when it comes to TestFlight and testing apps it s too much to ask 
len ratingtwo  Me gusta mucho tu aplicaci n
len ratingfive Let s go play later
len ratingfive Testing give opportunities 
len ratingone I find this app to be worthless
len ratingfive Great stuff
len ratingfive This is one of the best if not the best applications of this type 
len ratingfive The author is great on expanding and updating at an incredible rate while others wait forever to do any updates 
len ratingone  Just 
len ratingone YUCK 
len ratingfive  Destroying humanity children mind with ungodly distributions of information for money destroys and separates families from faith in humanity

len ratingthree I m giving this app a out of stars 
len ratingthree Overall experience using it makes it difficult to rank it any higher than out of alone 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive The best way to make use of NFC tags using IOS and NFC Tags
len ratingfive I enjoy finding new projects
len ratingfive  Super user friendly app 
len ratingfive One click and it s ready to go 
len ratingfive LOVE IT 
len ratingfive Love the automatic update feature added some time ago 
len ratingfive Makes everything so much easier 
len ratingfive This the best was to test out new apps on the beta program 
len ratingone I got invited to FunimBeta but I can t use it because when setting up my Apple ID I accidentally put the wrong year for my DOB and it won t let me use the app because it says I m under the age of but I m actually 
len ratingone We ve tried changing the year but it just goes right back to the same year that was accidentally chosen 
len ratingone It s not functional notification of although not accessible 
len ratingthree I cannot make all of the lightbulbs do the music function at one time no matter what I try
len ratingtwo There is zero cohesion in the introduction to build an app and getting started
len ratingfive  test flight 
len ratingthree Hac
len ratingfive  How
len ratingfive Works great
len ratingfive Fun times 
len ratingthree I like varied news not the same stuff all the time 
len ratingfive Am I playing this game I just started I already got up to 
len ratingfive On the first try but it s a really fun game
len ratingone i can t remember my redeem code and i m upset can there be a forgot code please
len ratingtwo I never got the email to redeem for testing 
len ratingtwo Still waiting for email 
len ratingone please share this app for ios
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingfive So easy and thorough 
len ratingfive Cool
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone I have never seen anything on this app 
len ratingfive I need a code
len ratingone Not good because you have to make a app and that s hard
len ratingone Office light switch keeps disconnecting from app 
len ratingone Have to constantly add the device 
len ratingtwo I can t figure out how to register 
len ratingtwo I was rushing and I think I missed a link 
len ratingtwo Now I m stuck and don t know what to do 
len ratingtwo Can I get some assistance 
len ratingone  I m getting asked for an invitation code before I can download anything can I please get the code
len ratingone This is is bad and horrible I rated star cause he says I m not witch I am and it stupid I recommend taking down this app forever please if you agree with me vote star for this stupid app thank you bye stupid app
len ratingone I try to go in and press continue but then it just say I must be and I am but why heck does it say 
len ratingone Confusion so I would like to know what s wrong and for now I m leaving it with a out of star sorry 
len ratingfive  Jason and his team has set a new standard for creating and presenting aviation ground school material 
len ratingfive I ve been flying for over thirty five years and have used many resources to educate myself and my students but The Finer Points Ground School is without a doubt the most comprehensive to date 
len ratingfive Jason s experience really shines through in the videos 
len ratingfive I especially appreciate the continuing effort to improve their product 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this app to anyone who is looking for quality substantive content that takes their knowledge to the next level 
len ratingone Why i cant download it
len ratingfive The best app ever invented
len ratingfive This is a fun way to try new updates that aren t available to everyone 
len ratingfive  app
len ratingfive A dedicated team skilled with professional work ethic 
len ratingfive They are determined to make the users overall experience flawless 
len ratingfive TikTok is one of the best apps I ve seen
len ratingfive This app is great to give the public the ability to beta test apps is extremely beneficial for app support and bugs I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to help out app developers and get features early 
len ratingfive If you want to be a part of a special community this is the perfect app for that 
len ratingfive Awesome
len ratingone I thought I would test games but every time I open it it says no games
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive It does what it says on the tin test apps with ease 
len ratingfive  I strongly recommend Sats Health beta 
len ratingfive This app is better and is unlike other fitness apps or crypto faucets 
len ratingfive I receive Sats daily for logging steps 
len ratingfive Just click Redeem in the app and a transaction is created 
len ratingfive Fast and super easy 
len ratingfive I anticipate the final app will incorporate advertisements or other method to fund currently the app has no ads and is free to use 
len ratingfive I ve witnessed enough crypto giveaway scams to be wary of free crypto other apps of this kind require tons of advertisement views personal information tracking coming with a high cost of time wasted and privacy exploitation 
len ratingfive Worse some apps never reward or offer only junk 
len ratingfive Sats Health is the best free app to easily stack Sats no cost no time wasted no invasive monitoring or privacy intrusions 
len ratingfive This is a great app 
len ratingone AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA

len ratingone Downloaded app but never got invitation or ability to open 
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingfive Thank you inlove this game
len ratingtwo Cannot submit app feedback due to character limit notice 
len ratingtwo I ve checked and my response is around 
len ratingtwo So what s wrong with my response that I m getting this notice instead 
len ratingtwo Because I am not above characters 
len ratingtwo So other than the sole function of the app not working seems to be going well

len ratingfive Gave me the car info amp the details we look at amp liked 
len ratingfive Test Flight allows users the chance to use pre launch features an app is considering adding to their product 
len ratingfive For people who are willing to give constructive feedback it s a useful tool that enables developers to tweak their apps according to how real people actually use them 
len ratingfive It s gratifying to know my feedback helps make apps better 
len ratingfive Who doesn t like testing bugs

len ratingfive This is the best game I have ever played and I ve been playing since

len ratingone So I really want to test games so I found this when I downloaded it I got sent to a screen that is blank besides in the top left corner it says redeem codes I can t get codes because it never asked my email 
len ratingone I m kind of upset because I thought this would work

len ratingfour Kamila
len ratingfive If you want to journal more in your life this is the answer 
len ratingthree Why only ios support 
len ratingthree Please ios support 
len ratingone Keeps crashing
len ratingfive It s very useful for organizing the apps you need to test and so on 
len ratingone According to my survey to test app after installing said app I should login using provided username amp password but these fields cannot be found 
len ratingone My screen says redeem code 
len ratingone I have no code to enter 
len ratingone Now I don t know what to do 
len ratingfive Good app 
len ratingfive TestFlight is an incredible and easy platform for beta testers like me to test out new apps and features

len ratingone Only offers access to items you haven t worked with in over a year 
len ratingone No access to the items you need 
len ratingtwo The test light system used to be so easy to use and now everything requires approval from this person or that person 
len ratingtwo It is a royal pain
len ratingone Why they didn t give me a public profile 
len ratingfive Best app hands down
len ratingone I try to login again but didn t wanna let me try to do another app on it but didn t wanna let me do you really help anything and I tried it two times so yeah
len ratingfive Perfect app to get to have laughs experience new things try new things and learn a lot as well meet new people from around the globe and have fun through these horrid times
len ratingthree It s a great app and I love the ability to test beta apps updates however after I put in reviews for the Snapchat update beta it doesn t say that I m testing the app and my screen is blank with the top right saying redeem

len ratingone It should be because you aren t able to get in if you aren t at least 
len ratingone I clicked the link to beta test and now with no test s I m stuck in a white page How do i getout
len ratingfive Been using it for years 
len ratingfive Very nice tool 
len ratingfive This is the best things that has ever happened in my life 
len ratingfive I have been playing RuneScape for the bulk of my entire childhood 
len ratingfive Anyone remember those soul suckingly boring car rides in the back seat of your parents car heading to you grandparents house 
len ratingfive That ll now be a thing of the past 
len ratingfive We can now literally play anytime any place Something that some of us didn t know we needed 
len ratingfive We needed a stronger bridge to gielinor 
len ratingfive We always had to disconnect from the world of gielinor to do any simple daily task we had to Endor as we had to step away from our computer screens 
len ratingfive For some of us RuneScape was an escape from the would around us now RuneScape The wonderful world of Gielinor will always be in our pockets 
len ratingfive Thank you jagex 
len ratingfive In game name Chris Agent
len ratingfive Te lo recomiendo
len ratingtwo Given that I have not had an opportunity to use the app yet I have no opinion of the app other than the user should not be prompted to rate the application if he or she has not yet interacted with it 
len ratingfive super
len ratingone Useless
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Thank goodness for this app it s so convenient and easy to use 
len ratingfive Literally my savior when going out and looking for vegan food 
len ratingfive I love seeing individual vegan dishes with photos and others commentary so helpful 
len ratingone TestFlight has a limit of characters for a beta feedback submission and displays an error message if this character count is exceeded problem is TestFlight doesn t show the character count at all so the user has no clue if their submission entry is characters or higher making it hard for the user to correct their submission to meet the limits 
len ratingone Apple please show the character count in the beta feedback response to make it easier to provide meaningful feedback to iOS developers 
len ratingfive I love this App keep up good work
len ratingone I don t understand
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive I love this app it s great definitely check it out
len ratingfive This is a great solution for bats testing new apps for the iPhone
len ratingfive Plz tell me
len ratingfive Excellent idea
len ratingthree Can I have an invitation code plz
len ratingfive Hoursa
len ratingthree I feel one should at least be given access to all the premium features in an app not only to fully test all the functionalities but as a fair and due means of compensating us who volunteer to give our time and feedback for a developer who s not going to improve on the UI but eventually make a profit in part due to the collaboration of those who participate in programs like this 
len ratingthree Don t know how many other apps are under this thing but at least the one I use it for GRINDR gives you ZERO abs further limits you 
len ratingthree Not nice 
len ratingfive This app is great 
len ratingfive Great to be a beta tester
len ratingfive Absolutely love this app 
len ratingfive TiK Tok testers is really neat
len ratingtwo  i m from tiktok

len ratingfive Very nice app
len ratingtwo  mkljhvvdrtgvy yhbffhjnbf
len ratingtwo I load the app from a notification right as I m about to click Install Update it kicks me back to the main page 
len ratingtwo I constantly have to tell it I understand when opening the app and I have to constantly go through the new Start testing step acceptance 
len ratingfive I have to try it st 
len ratingfive  I don t know yet
len ratingfive It s really cool 
len ratingfive Didn t think I d say this but this app has actually gotten better since Apple took over 
len ratingfive It works good and is a lifesaver for developers 
len ratingfive It s good to see that Apple didn t just buy this and abandon it 
len ratingfive It s been well maintained and runs bug free 
len ratingfive There are definitely features that could be added 
len ratingfive But at least it s in a solid spot right now so it s hard to complain 
len ratingfive  Just nice 
len ratingfive So there was some glitches and parts that red it be improved but other than that it did it s poropse
len ratingfive User friendly and easy to access
len ratingone When you re not and the app says 
len ratingfive Love this app for my children 
len ratingfive Keeps them engaged in class work especially during COVID 
len ratingfive Has improved their overall test scores 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive I hope you will launch soon 
len ratingfive Muy buena la recomiendo

len ratingfive Sunsama keeps me productive in a Zen kind of way 
len ratingfive It helps set the tone for the kind of day I will have

len ratingfive Multitasking doesn t get frenzied when using this product 
len ratingone I don t even what this app is for 
len ratingone I downloaded Ifunny and this app got downloaded a few minutes later 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive I have used the stock apps from Apple Google Amazon etc 
len ratingfive BTR Amp is a must have for anyone that has their own music collection 
len ratingfive  Good App
len ratingfive Great App keeping me on the right track 
len ratingfive Love how it s very informative on stroke technique and providing tips and videos how to improve 
len ratingfive A drill mode would be nice and beeper 
len ratingfive  thank you very much and appreciative for all your hard efforts Any chance for the finish flag in the swim workouts provided registers the workout when complete so as to keep tab 
len ratingfive OK
len ratingone Why is it that you have to be to play when it is rated 
len ratingone In other words trash designing 
len ratingtwo Fix the app so I can redeem code from nineanimAtor
len ratingfive  Cool app
len ratingfive Great so far 
len ratingfive No
len ratingfive Muy buenoooo
len ratingfive  I am constantly impressed with the new modern technological advances I get to grow and watch evolve with my age as well it s a beautiful and enjoyable place for me to escape and get involved into when I need to get away from the realities around me for a moment 
len ratingfive Most definitely an area I am honored to help grow in any way possible 
len ratingfive We deserve anything we can make grow with our imaginations hard work research and most importantly love and interests as well 
len ratingfive I m Shawn Brennan and I thank you for allowing me to have a part in it all in any way that is granted to my availability and control 
len ratingfive Sincerely honored and appreciated Shawn Brennan EagleEyeCommunications and artist
len ratingone The app is not working
len ratingone If they let me give a zero instead of stars I would have 
len ratingone I downloaded it just as I was told to by Square Beta but all I got was that I had no apps to test 
len ratingone Was told that should had it pick up on the Square app 
len ratingfive Todo bien tranquilo
len ratingone It says on the app but you have to be to use it which is stupid 
len ratingone I ll up my rating when you change it 
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingfive It has allowed me to almost guarantee that all extra work gets documented 
len ratingfive It has also allowed me to speed up my cash flow for billing change orders 
len ratingtwo I ve been using TestFlight long enough to have received a reply to One of the many emails I ve sent in the last Months but I ve never received any replies at all 
len ratingtwo I ve had more trouble keeping people from taking over my accounts since I ve joined TestFlight and maybe that s why 
len ratingtwo If this Really is TestFlight Reply to the emails I have sent and send me OpenVPN that is safe to use 
len ratingfive This game is more Challenging than you would think 
len ratingfive It fun and fast 
len ratingfive This is the best app on the planet 
len ratingone DOODOO
len ratingone Crash doesn t work and waste of time
len ratingthree Please how do I get the invitation on my email I need urgent help so the TestFlight can work on my phone 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive If you own an Apple Watch you must must have this app 
len ratingfive No questions asked 
len ratingfive Just get it you won t regret it 
len ratingfive Finally 
len ratingfive There is an application where everything is in one organized place 
len ratingfive This allows for efficiency creativity and connection to flourish 
len ratingfive So excited to have this resource 
len ratingfive It pushes present technology into its next form 
len ratingfive I am happy to be a beta tester for an application that loads thru test flight 
len ratingfive It is fun for me to be trying this application and seeing how it benefits me in my life 
len ratingfive I love the fact that I can write down my thoughts on an electronic journal app on my iPhone 
len ratingfive Haven t decided if I want to save it as a book journal or not 
len ratingfive What really helps is that I can keep track of my daily diabetes blood tests so when I go to the doctor I can just pull out my iPhone and show him the record in my e journal 
len ratingfive This apps makes Beta testing so easy and users to access to those fascinating new features 
len ratingfive I love the new concept 
len ratingfive Actually makes more want to get things done on time 
len ratingfive Nice job
len ratingfive I am hooked on TIkTok most people are amazing and fun 
len ratingfive The app has lots of fun effects you can use to make TikTok videos 
len ratingfive I want to use it at church

len ratingone Please Walgreens 
len ratingone Do better 
len ratingone This app needs major improvements 
len ratingone This device is great for holding pills 
len ratingone The reports simply do not work 
len ratingfive BEST APP EVER
len ratingfour You can t even redeem the software that I just purchased 
len ratingfour The code stops after you input two digits 
len ratingfour Starting to smell like a scam to me 
len ratingfive There aren t any other options of good apps to use with ios for EUCs 
len ratingfive this app works very well and the developers are absolutely hands on and brilliant 
len ratingfive they have a telegram page that is active with members and the developers are very responsive 
len ratingfive problems are discussed there and shortly afterwards they fix the issues 
len ratingfive the cost of this app to get all the features in my opinion is money well spent 
len ratingfive So I m not sure what is malfunctioning the simple cut and paste app I made or the App test lab app to test the app 
len ratingfive Other than that it s fine
len ratingfive I love the Apple ecosystem for application development and testing 
len ratingfive With TestFlight I m able to identify issues I didn t necessarily find in developer testing 
len ratingfive This is a phenomenal tool 
len ratingfive  It s just bad ass
len ratingone  I read the entire higher data is managed page and then the app shows you that there are no available apps to down and test 
len ratingone I d give it less than one star possible
len ratingfive Gets you out and off the couch everyday 
len ratingfive A little confusing at first seeing as you both take turns and don t go at the same time 
len ratingfive But after you get a couple streaks going it all makes sense 
len ratingone  Google test no issues 
len ratingone Here 
len ratingone Step one send email invite Step two hope the use the browser not the app to accept Etc etc What a pain 
len ratingfive It works great and keeps everything up to date 
len ratingfive Totally worth it 
len ratingfive Just let them know what s up 
len ratingfive HIRE JAE THE HYBRID WHITE FOR YOUR NEXT COMMERCIAL OR PRINT JOB 
len ratingfive PAY ME N BITCOIN Jaethehybridwhite Crypto Fitness Model Covid DIET COVID workout
len ratingfive What a great app this is 
len ratingfive I was able to connect to many people 
len ratingfive I was also lucky enough to meet my soul mate 
len ratingfive And the app is just getting better 
len ratingfive Best mobile editing app around 
len ratingfive Only one you will ever need 
len ratingtwo I for one am very sad because I never got to use a public link
len ratingfive The test flight brings on a lot of changes some are great some are challenging to try to keep cameras on and error free 
len ratingfive This is why I do the testing hopefully my feedback helps 
len ratingfive Great app to keep everything organized 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Very efficient way to score and document our game playing 
len ratingfive I d like to get my code invitation please 
len ratingfive It won t send anything to my email so I can t get a code no matter what I do 
len ratingfive This app allows you to test future versions of many of the apps you already use 
len ratingfive It is nice being ahead of the curve seeing and testing new features of your favorite apps 
len ratingfive I only got this for RuneScape can t do anything
len ratingfive So far I love this app to manage my child s account 
len ratingfive I use to have to login through browser but this is so much simpler and faster 
len ratingfive Great job 
len ratingfive  Roger
len ratingone  I cants get any apps to test
len ratingfive I recently switched to the DS Defender VPN and browser 
len ratingfive It s super fast and love the ad free browser built right in 
len ratingfive Nice job 
len ratingfive I am spreading the word 
len ratingone Do not work
len ratingfive Great
len ratingfive  Now I get to play creatures of aether
len ratingfive I enjoy beta testing apps and TestFlight helps me test apps before they launch to help them run smoother once they go live 
len ratingfive This App is Amazing 
len ratingfive Having a red bubble on the left side of the app but love the app in general 
len ratingfive Great with copping 
len ratingfive To be apart of this testing 
len ratingfive The app Is phenomenal
len ratingfive Ski tracks is by far the best ski app on the market 
len ratingfive I ski Monday to Friday all season at Hunter mountain and most of my ski friends have it as well 
len ratingfive It s fun to compare stats with my peeps at the lodge bar at the end of the day 
len ratingfive Awesome app 
len ratingfive Great for the dive community 
len ratingfive Great design easy to share video with 
len ratingfive The app to use for a camera setup with virtual meetings 
len ratingfive Easy to connect setup and use 
len ratingfive Great video quality 
len ratingfive Like the app lot of fun
len ratingfive Gr
len ratingfour Firstly I love how a lot of these reviews are for apps that people are testing and not TestFlight itself 
len ratingfour Anywho this app is simple to use 
len ratingfour There s really not much to complain about 
len ratingfour My only idea for improvement would be to have an update all button especially on Apple TV where you have to navigate into the app details view to even update
len ratingone Won t let me open the app
len ratingfive My brother is using Test flight to get people to try his app in beta and get feedback from other people 
len ratingfive It s pretty useful 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingone Haven t been able to use it because it keeps asking for a redeem code that I never received Can I be sent one And what do I need to download to the other device Auto Forward or TestFlight 
len ratingfive HiAfter five days my app need to intivaoin code Please guide me how to take intivation code
len ratingfive Great graphics and sound 
len ratingfive Easy to play and upgrade your ship 
len ratingfive Careful as the time flies with this shooter 
len ratingfive I wish this new version showed badges for updates like the App Store icon does 
len ratingfour There is no way to record the Facebook games and how they react to the new changes 
len ratingfive aroo 
len ratingfive As an artist I love the app and use it all the time whenever I happen to be painting or editing a photo
len ratingfive So you may think sometimes apps are bad and need to improve so they get more downloads that may happen but when I used TestFlight I was able to get free Netflix with even more the app is called ZiniTevi its a really nice app and TestFlight should get credit for this thank u TestFlight 
len ratingfive Simple and effective way to test apps 
len ratingfive I think this is a great idea
len ratingfive It works well 
len ratingfive I have tested quite a few apps and never any problems with test flight 
len ratingone I would give this a better review however I am unable to access the app due to the fact that I am at years old and not 
len ratingone Despite the fact that it is rated on the App Store I am unable to access the app 
len ratingone I hope this issue is resolved 
len ratingfive It s good
len ratingfive  HiAfter five days my app need to intivaoin code Please guide me how to take intivation code
len ratingone makes me sad
len ratingthree Over all I really like it but it s hard to navigate and I m not really sure how to fix the app I m using as in turn of the bata testing can you help with that

len ratingfive  This is by far the best that I ve ever used and has way to many features that others do not have available for people who travel 
len ratingfive Opening up with the gas prices of the nearest gas stations and real time prices along the route even customizing to my favorite gas stations 
len ratingfive To give people like me who are on the highways very often the information that s needed making this a very much needed navigation tool beyond any of the others 
len ratingfive I truly love it 
len ratingone  I haven t been able to use it 
len ratingone How do I acces applications to test 
len ratingfive top notch tool 
len ratingfive excited to check out the search feature

len ratingfive But honestly I love it 
len ratingfive I love that Apple is finally opening up iOS a little more to apps outside the AppStore but doing it carefully and in such a way that it can t be done unintentionally or maliciously 
len ratingfive This the best app for mixers and djs and producers to be creative

len ratingone Wanted to help friends beta an app but this process makes no sense gives me nowhere to go for help 
len ratingone Instructions and invite code are not clear 
len ratingone No code 
len ratingone It asks for a code to view my app but no code sent then it says contact developer to receive redeem code 
len ratingone Why not just let me in 
len ratingone Why the hoops we have to leap through

len ratingfour Received notifications when an opportunity became available 
len ratingfour  No spam emails 
len ratingfour It s Rare to receive opportunities to complete surveys 
len ratingfour Needs more trust building tasks 
len ratingfour Lacking in customer support within the App 
len ratingfour Only multiple choices questions Suggestions to App developers Add an automated chat bubble that consumers can ask simple questions for more successful clarifications 
len ratingone The developer needed to recode 
len ratingone This app will lose your login info and not allow you back in and that s with a paid account
len ratingfive Iam

len ratingone When I hit the accept button there is no response 
len ratingone So I then have to log on to the CX app which takes too much time while driving and then you must continually input your username and password while working on the app because you time out and must login again 
len ratingone I m sorry but this is not user friendly at this time

len ratingfive The only weapons worth paying real money for are as of oct IMO the shurikans desert eagle m sniper rifle 
len ratingfive I ve found none of the other weapons worth paying real money for

len ratingone Im new user nothing to test at the moment 
len ratingone There are people like me eager to test lots of apps in exchange for rewards
len ratingfive  Great vision for the app 
len ratingfive Keep working the bugs out where where iPhone Ford Sync and Nexar have conflicts 
len ratingfive They all cause one or the other to deactivate

len ratingfive I signed up for xcloud preview but there s only one game you can play unlike android with games and there s a very low chance you will even be selected for the preview
len ratingone  Hi I have a problem with the age 
len ratingone I worked so hard on getting this and it got ruined with it saying I need to be 
len ratingone I am and please fix this 
len ratingone Literally there s nothing to ever test 
len ratingone Why would the rating say for but you have to be or older to access the app 
len ratingone That s kinda stupid to be honest with you 
len ratingone If you Change that I will for sure give you a star rating 
len ratingone But if you don t I will keep a star rating 
len ratingone Title says it all
len ratingfive I haven t gotten the app yet but I m guessing it will be good
len ratingone  But never received my activation code and now it s been several days and I cannot find a developer direct email to let him know and now I keep being asked for that code but don t have one to give because I never received a code to this day 
len ratingtwo  Lagging wont let me active my key

len ratingfive Nice job Dear team member s
len ratingtwo Why did the RuneScape App icon install appear but say beta busy please try again 
len ratingtwo It also said this would be available for hours But I icon after few minutes disappeared 
len ratingtwo Does this even work 
len ratingtwo I DON T LIKE IT
len ratingone This app tells the exact nature apple is going day by day 
len ratingone It has become a nightmare for both testers and developers
len ratingfive  I ve had the most fun I ve probably had since before the rona
len ratingthree When i have new build then test note in previous build been lost 
len ratingfive  I can finally test thx so much
len ratingone Got Initial email to try the beta version 
len ratingone Downloaded the app and it had a redeem code I should have received when I downloaded never received code and did not give any instructions on how to receive the code 
len ratingone This was a very bad beta test with very poor customer service 
len ratingone I paid a lot of money for this app and I still haven t been able to use it
len ratingone I was trying to link my discord and this app was what I was going to use 
len ratingone Then a thing popped up saying you must be over years old to use this 
len ratingone  Not working
len ratingfive  Simply I love Tiktok
len ratingfive  Amazing app that i have ever seen
len ratingfive  Helps keep me busy during quarantine
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  My kids and I love this app
len ratingone I have not got a test this is a bad app since I do not get a test
len ratingone  I personally like the app 
len ratingone It gets the job done and does what it s supposed to do 
len ratingone What I hate is that the app is full of bugs and it makes it impossible to update apps that I am in the beta with 
len ratingone It takes tries and a restart on my phone to update ONE app because it freezes at the end 
len ratingone Please update and I may change my review 
len ratingone Thanks 
len ratingfive Wish I could roll with this one its lit to the leo 
len ratingone I m giving this a star because I wanted to play Runescape in its beta release 
len ratingone And this app pretty much screwed me over on getting a spot on the dot for the game 
len ratingone So I have to give this a one star sorry 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingone The minute the beta for RuneScape dropped I got numerous error codes then I was told it was full 
len ratingone Broken app 
len ratingone Doesn t actually open
len ratingfive  Guelor
len ratingone BRING IT BACK
len ratingone I have problems with the beta test I can open my game
len ratingfour This app is pretty fun to be honest 
len ratingfour I love getting the apps and testing the apps in this game 
len ratingfour I m concerned that you have to get permission from the creator which is stupid in my opinion 
len ratingfour I have the IPhone but others don t and they might even not have access to this game because of the stupid permission to get in 
len ratingone No apps available to test
len ratingone I need help with receiving emails
len ratingone Asking for a code 
len ratingfour Any chance u can give me an invitation code 
len ratingfour Please and thank you
len ratingtwo Don t even know why they wanted me to download this because it s not letting me do anything 
len ratingthree  Love this app but Needs More types of mediations for real life struggles like anxiety fear health manifesting loss of a friend or loved one bad habits sobriety overcoming new challenges taking on tomorrow like it s a new day motivational speech for an interview or dream striving for like a hype man more more more 
len ratingthree One for sleep and one for awake per thing would be amazing to use this more frequently for guidance throughout our days for overcoming obstacles 
len ratingthree I mean come on were paying a good amount here for this app 
len ratingthree Needs way more content for the users 
len ratingthree Not just kids stuff 
len ratingthree Adults too 
len ratingthree We have the real struggles that a meditation is very helpful for 
len ratingthree Please provide more 
len ratingthree Keep users intrigued 
len ratingthree My suggestion is to Do a NIGHT amp DAY SHIFT of each one FOR YOUR USERS TO CHOSE THEIR MOOD choose their vibe of mediation 
len ratingthree Like for example for the loss of a friend night shift could help guide you to sleep and think about your life presently and previously 
len ratingthree Where the day shift could be a positive memory of the loss of the loved one helping and pushing you through the day to finish strong 
len ratingthree See what I mean 
len ratingthree Work every angle 
len ratingthree Users want moreeeee for adultsss

len ratingone I downloaded this and now my TikTok account is suspended 
len ratingone Literally I download it yesterday to try out a beta version of TikTok and it suspended my entire account

len ratingfive  It s good
len ratingfive  Ok bommmmmmmmmmmer

len ratingfive I think it would be great but I don t have a code to test
len ratingone  I have tried to reach out to this company for days now 
len ratingone They are impossible to get a hold of 
len ratingone I have asked several times for them to call me but all I get is an email with useless information

len ratingfive Getting better each time

len ratingone I ll never accept again 
len ratingone I have lost days worth of work from my app that I was play 
len ratingone Now it wants to make me start from day one 
len ratingone Don t accept to be a tester 
len ratingfive I love this apps
len ratingfive Best social media
len ratingone The only reason I kept this app was to give it an angry review 
len ratingone WHY THE HECK DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO MAKE AN APP 
len ratingone I AM AND I THINK THIS IS RIDICULOUS 
len ratingone SO to you apple 
len ratingone  to you 
len ratingfive It was a great first experience I would recommend 
len ratingone I have totally lost my Township game by using this app 
len ratingone Now that I do not want to continue with the beta testing I can not just go back to the regular app
len ratingtwo I am trying to report an issue with my game glitching out 
len ratingtwo Up until this morning I have had no issues for the last days after accepting this beta test for township 
len ratingtwo I cannot seem to find a way to contact them even in Facebook 
len ratingtwo I have turned my phone off twice now to reboot but it is not working 
len ratingone What do I do with this app and how do I use it 
len ratingfive How can I get a new invitation code 
len ratingfive  They helped me with whatever I needed
len ratingfive  Sevnaz
len ratingfive Apple is the best
len ratingfour Pretty cool 
len ratingfour Will probably need a little bit more time to review 
len ratingfour Although as of now it is pretty great 
len ratingtwo I have been trying to update the war robots test server but it never shows up so I tried to reinstall and no I do have war robots at all I need help
len ratingfive  Perfect for keeping track of reps and times when following an exercise plan 
len ratingone Me diste que necesito una invitaci n 
len ratingone  I downloaded this app on my years old daughter s phone of which we both currently use 
len ratingone And even though this page said we could not continue because it s really 
len ratingone And now I have to click a star because this won t submit otherwise 
len ratingone My ZERO out of five still stands 
len ratingone Why can t I choose an account to log in through the app directly 
len ratingone Apple is really dumb sometimes 
len ratingfive It was quick and simple
len ratingone When trying to view the Beta version of Accuweather it shows no apps available What do I do 
len ratingone  Why 
len ratingthree Had trouble with scrolling through the chat the eye colors don t change also the clothing look a little weird as in they look a little too big on the characters 
len ratingthree Other than that it could be a really cool and popular game 
len ratingthree Not world wide or a smash hit but definitely a game that could potentially a very popular game 
len ratingthree My prediction if you guys continue to improve would be at least stars overall and maybe at least K people rating and at least K people trying it out when it comes out 
len ratingfive I like it 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingfive Going to share with out of town friends once ready to go 
len ratingfive Tr s bon app pour l achat des mat riaux de construction au Mali
len ratingone i used it on tiktok and now i cant get into my tiktok because it says beta has expired and then i got back this app and stopped testing on tiktok and it still says beta has expired
len ratingfive Great and easy process 
len ratingfive  I don t understand half of your reviews 
len ratingfive Is it possible half of you are too dumb to realize that your testing an app by another company through this app 
len ratingfive Like it seems most of you are leaving comments reviewing the app your testing which is in beta if it s being used through here but I don t think it was the developers idea to hear the opinions of the users was to come to the reviews of the Apple store just saying but I ve never even used it yet I was just snagging it and noticed the reviews that were about multiple apps isn t this like a virtual machine 
len ratingfive Bouts see
len ratingfive Very excited to start testing 
len ratingone I tried multiple times and I never receive an invitation email 
len ratingone I open the app and click next and get the message no apps to be tested 
len ratingone So it s kinda weird and not working 
len ratingone I m on an iPhone Xs 
len ratingone I also have an iWatch series but I never got anything on that either 
len ratingfive Need invitation code
len ratingone  This app is a piece of ca ca
len ratingone Me and my friends have many apps that we use together and this app works for them but for some reason it doesn t work for me I have found it impossible to test a beta on this app 
len ratingfive Love tiktok
len ratingone i used this app so i could become a beta tester for snapchat 
len ratingone within ten days of using it my snapchat was locked for using a third party app 
len ratingone i had to wait over hours for my snapchat to be unlocked 
len ratingone definitely don t recommend this app 
len ratingone Doesn t Work
len ratingfive I love this app
len ratingone  I can not test anything I have friends that use this app and can test things but for some reason I can t test anything 
len ratingfive Really a cool deal 
len ratingone I ve tried to do this to beta test TikTok but there are no instructions as to WHAT to test or anything 
len ratingone It tells you to send them a screenshot but not what you re supposed to have taken a screenshot of 
len ratingone Oh and while you re trying to figure it out they boot you out for not doing what they asked 
len ratingone At that point they re just collecting your data from your phone without you being aware anymore

len ratingfive  upmobi xyz is a very good aso service provider 
len ratingfive Rating review keyword install almost all the countries can do 
len ratingfive Come and visit at upmobi xyz if you want to get more organic users 
len ratingfour Nothing so much so developer if you could give me a invitation code please that would be great 
len ratingone There s never any apps available when I open this app and check for some 
len ratingfive Great way to hang out with friends and family during the covid lockdown 
len ratingfive Easy to have conversation and group laughs 
len ratingfive Plan to continue using after freedom returns 
len ratingfive  I love to start testing
len ratingfive  Best app ever
len ratingfive This app is great for wasting time of catching up on the latest trends but it could be more clear to newer users I ve hade it since it came out almost so now I know how it works but when I started using it I was a bit confused
len ratingfour Overall this version provides a similar experience to other shephard air products i have used 
len ratingfour My primary suggestion is to add a more clear response to selecting an answer choice 
len ratingfour As it is there is only a slight highlight on the choice i select and it makes me constantly double take to ensure my click registered 
len ratingfour Additionally i think having a more significant highlight would reinforce the connection between the answer and the physical tap 
len ratingfive The app Funimate send me a link for the funimbeta app it is amaizing I feel cool with the update before ppl without the beta app
len ratingone Can t login 
len ratingone Help me out 
len ratingone Using device iPhone Pro Max 
len ratingone Kind Regards Masud Mozumder From Chittagong
len ratingfive Enjoying Rapid Ring working very well 
len ratingfive Works just as expected 
len ratingfive Muy din mico
len ratingfive Need code
len ratingone Tic toc told me to instal yet never have me an installation code to redeem
len ratingthree I am a full time developer and tester most the times when I go to test for IOS games the link doesn t work and then it says I have to type in some verification code in which they never got one 
len ratingthree And then I have no way to actually upload stuff to TestFlight since it has this major step process it wants to go through 
len ratingthree I ll take the time with other programs thank you 
len ratingthree Please find a way to fix that code system though 
len ratingone  The very first thing this app does after redeeming the first code is asking for a review 
len ratingone One star for nagging 
len ratingfive When ever possible I always try to use signal 
len ratingfive It s like a open platform version of iMessage and is encrypted unlike many many other messenger apps 
len ratingfive Long time user on Android now on iOS 
len ratingone Can t log in for Nielsen
len ratingfive It seems more organized 
len ratingfive The new look is refreshing and easy to use 
len ratingfive I use this app to brighten and add more color to my pictures 
len ratingfive I like that all the settings are under the photos so you can get everything out of the way much faster 
len ratingfive Pleas help isn t open
len ratingfive  so creative and fun 
len ratingfive great app 
len ratingfive  I can t wait to try out all the stuff this has to offer
len ratingfive  Hey guys you really should check this app out 
len ratingfive It s a great way to track and treat people who may feel they have symptoms from COVID 
len ratingfive It takes you through the diff signs and symptoms that you may be feeling and you can actually communicate with your local hospital urgent care about coming in to get tested 
len ratingfive What really set this app apart from others I ve viewed is your healthcare provider can actually track you real time and know exactly when you will be arriving 
len ratingfive Excellent tool to help combat this virus 
len ratingone The test app seems to be a step backwards 
len ratingone Navigation is more cumbersome and labors 
len ratingone For instance getting to saved locations only required scrolling on the right side of the screen 
len ratingone Now you must tap the locations tap at the top of the page and then choose the new location 
len ratingone From my experience so far the beta app should be canned 
len ratingfive  abuses 
len ratingfive OMG IM A FAN IN CREATIVE PEOPLE amp when you stumble over greatness like this it always out beats the looser for not pushing the envelope to the next level 
len ratingfive Congrats and glad To be apart of history 
len ratingone I don t know where to get this
len ratingfive  ga
len ratingfive I sleep well after I use this app thank u very much 
len ratingfive Love this app highly recommended 
len ratingone This app won t work on my iPad 
len ratingone No apps to review why download this app
len ratingfive I can t use it yet until I am invited 
len ratingfive Hopefully it happens soon 
len ratingone  i got this app to add a link to my tiktok bio and i have watched multiple videos and followed the steps on this app and it will not work 
len ratingfive This app is amazing in sooo many ways
len ratingfour It s a good game reminds me of imvu 
len ratingfour Other than some glitches that I came across which is understandable since this is not the full release maby to make it more interesting add some mini games or something like that keep up the great work 
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingtwo  I personally have found it impossible to use this app at all being a developer and beta tester I should have access to various apps and points of communication with the developers in order to provide the most effective feedback 
len ratingtwo I have seen no such thing in this case and I think to most effectively fix this issue we should input a list of contacts for those either testing the upcoming releases of these apps or those in the Developers Program in order for these individuals to communicate easier with companies who need testers 
len ratingtwo I know this is no easy feat and will take some doing 
len ratingtwo However I really think this app is necessary for the improvement of any app being developed and the better the testing and reviewing the higher quality of app that is developed 
len ratingfive Wow amazing app
len ratingone The app rating says meaning all ages can use it then when I try to use the app it says you must be and up to use this app so why dont you change the app age rating to that way people don t have to be excited and then not be able to use the age rated app 
len ratingone Idk what I did when I downloaded this app but I need a code to redeem 
len ratingone How can I get one 
len ratingone Need ASAP my son is in BT for the Air Force 
len ratingone Thanks
len ratingfive Jalal
len ratingfive hagh
len ratingfive Perfect I love it
len ratingfive Love using the application 
len ratingfive Normally up all hours of the night scrolling 
len ratingthree It s telling me I need to redeem a invitation code how do I do that 
len ratingone How do I get a app out of testing mode I don t want it anymore 
len ratingthree You asked for a review when I m just at installation stage 
len ratingthree I ve rated it star only because I m hoping it meets minimum requirements
len ratingone I am and in the App Store it says and won t let me get on
len ratingfive Ojbk
len ratingone Then nothing 
len ratingone Redeem what 
len ratingfour Okay
len ratingfive  I ve been using this app now for the last week and a half and I find it so much more intuitive than other apps I ve used for meditation and mindfulness 
len ratingfive Some of the other apps I ve tried are kind of well phony where this feels like it was written by people who understand neuroscience and the nature of our bus lives 
len ratingfive I enjoy the experience 
len ratingfive It s def helping me quiet my mind 
len ratingfive good
len ratingone  I have no clue as to what the App is for for some reason it shows up in my iCloud account which I disabled on my iPhone as soon as I got 
len ratingone I can t get the test flight invitation code
len ratingone I don t understand why you need to be years 
len ratingone At least if your going to say that change the fact that the app says 
len ratingone When I signed up to test something it just made the app crash more and more and more I tried to use it
len ratingfive  This app like I thought it was a scam but like seriously fr fr I actually got paid 
len ratingfive I will seriously try any app they offer me if I get paid again because it s actually cool to try apps and just get paid for your feedback 
len ratingfive I highly recommend this and you will get paid for your work 
len ratingone Advertising does not clear when x is in left hand corner

len ratingone It is a bunch of junk 
len ratingone I was prompted to download this app by Scotia bank Caribbean as an update for beta testing 
len ratingone I did that and now this app tells me that the Scotia app is not recognizable for testing 
len ratingone Scotia app always redirects me to this app which gives the same message 
len ratingone Now I can t open my Scotia app 
len ratingtwo It was a ok game but it need more to it and no one is one it so boring

len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive R t tuy t v i
len ratingfive First screening app of the kind 
len ratingfive  It s awesome
len ratingone That s all it says even after updating 
len ratingone This has been the case for months 
len ratingone I think it s pretty sad that when I supported android I was invited to every beta test i applied for including xcloud now I have supported apple and I have all there gear including latest and greatest and can t get a beta invite to either Albion or project xcloud that s pathetic 
len ratingone And people will know my story thanks testflightfor proving exactly what I have said all along with apple
len ratingfive Quiero utilizar la app pero no se me hace posible me pide un codigo para canjear me pueden ayudar en eso
len ratingone App Store says but when I try to play it it says must be what it is 
len ratingone Waste of my time 
len ratingone I am currently using an old account for I don t have a new one and I m way over but the app keeps telling me that I must be over is it broken or something 
len ratingone I m just confused 
len ratingfour Wish I was able to test Out more apps Pleaseeeee 
len ratingfive  The app I have been looking for 
len ratingfive I love getting a notification when my family has posted something 
len ratingfive I like how it is private so I can just post a picture for my family to see 
len ratingfive Definitely going to tell my friends about this 
len ratingfive Thought it was gonna be another stupid app but it s fire highly recommended
len ratingfive Need Access Sent me Code
len ratingtwo This app is impossible to navigate 
len ratingtwo Impossible 
len ratingtwo Don t even bother try getting an app on multiple devices 
len ratingtwo Every app I try to test its the same problems 
len ratingtwo I don t give reviews but had to come here to express my frustration 
len ratingtwo Is there something else I can use 
len ratingtwo Just Horrible
len ratingfive  Abc

len ratingfive  It gives you a chance to be the first to do something
len ratingfive I CAN BE A TIKTOK TEASTER
len ratingfive This is the best app ever and also if you want to join Snapchat beta get this app 
len ratingone Latest update shows splash screen hangs crashes 
len ratingone No clue what to do to get to my beta apps which I need to do for testing publishing 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingone Repeatedly getting Couldn t load apps 
len ratingone TestFlight is currently unavailable 
len ratingone Try again later I ve deleted the TestFlight app amp reinstalled I ve restarted my iPhone I keep hitting the link in the email announcing the AutoMetrics app is available for testing via TestFlight 
len ratingone Always the same bad result 
len ratingone  p
len ratingfive I love this 
len ratingfive I am going to be able to enjoy my life more because of this tool 
len ratingfive I did a star because I m nice and I just got this so I don t know yet soo 
len ratingtwo  Why do you have to be years and younger
len ratingfour Good App
len ratingone I just downloaded it and nothing happened 
len ratingone No link to sign up 
len ratingone Not sure if download is bad 
len ratingone I tried twice 
len ratingone I do not know how to get an invite So i can not test any apps I have never tested before but would like to start testing
len ratingfour once you are into the beta programs for some of your applications all is good but the notifications are not coming have to be notified by email 
len ratingfour interesting that there is no notifications especially from an apple app 
len ratingfive I like
len ratingone  TestFlight has a limit of characters for a beta feedback submission and displays an error message if this character count is exceeded problem is TestFlight doesn t show the character count at all so the user has no clue if their submission entry is characters or higher making it hard for the user to correct their submission to meet the limits 
len ratingone Apple please show the character count in the beta feedback response to make it easier to provide meaningful feedback to iOS developers 
len ratingthree Still got issues I don t
len ratingone Don t understand what I m doing
len ratingone You have to be but be to use the app please explain how that makes sense 
len ratingone Have never been able to use it and it pulls the audio volume way down on the radios
len ratingfive This is the best stat app ever 
len ratingfive Cfgffjdjdjdjfrjjxjdjcjdcjdjcjdjxddff hi
len ratingfive  Creativo
len ratingone  test flight wont send a link to where i can download nine animator
len ratingthree  The purpose of the app is to see your Nest camera from your iWatch 
len ratingthree It does that but it doesn t send a notification to the iWatch when there s activity triggered on your Nest camera 
len ratingthree Unlike the old version of the Nest app before Google took over 
len ratingthree I do get notifications sent to my iPhone but not the iWatch 
len ratingthree I would love to see the developer s update the app to send notifications directly to the iWatch 
len ratingthree Thanks
len ratingfive Excellent way to keep in touch with influencers you follow 
len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingone Junk app
len ratingone I wasn t able to get the invitation code to complete the installation
len ratingfive I would love to do this it sounds very interesting and fun but I just can t find a way to get in unless it says I m not over which i am over 
len ratingfive This testing application is great
len ratingone Idk why I keep getting removed 
len ratingone What would be the reason why one would be removed 
len ratingone I know I didn t violate any rules 
len ratingone Doesn t work period 
len ratingfive Love tiktok it s amazing and has some great ideas on there and the video are cool
len ratingfive TestFlight is wonderful for allowing groups of testers participation in the IOS application development process 
len ratingfive Extremely efficient 
len ratingfive I really enjoy testing all kinds of stuff TestFlight allows me to do that 
len ratingfive TestFlight doesn t expect you to lie and say something is good when it s really not 
len ratingtwo It s not letting me open the beta app but I keep getting notification from the beta app which makes it annoying because I can t see or control the beta app now because it won t let me open it 
len ratingtwo Yet the notifications keep coming 
len ratingone I don t see anything in here
len ratingfive Get updates give feedback see versions 
len ratingone Every time I open the app I am getting error TestFlight is currently unavailable 
len ratingone Please try again later 
len ratingone I hav tried deleting and reinstalling the app 
len ratingone I have factory reset my device too but nothing seems to work 
len ratingone P simo
len ratingfour  Hey
len ratingone It says on the age but you have to be to use it 
len ratingone NOT HAPPY 
len ratingone Other team members have no such problems 
len ratingone There is no indication of what might be wrong or how to fix it 
len ratingfive  Tiktok is the future I can t wait to get verified 
len ratingfive  Won t install skype
len ratingfive The way my life is going now I know that this app is exactly what I m looking for so I left this review to let my past self and future self know what s up 
len ratingfive A fun and exciting new way to use your creativity to entertain and inform friends 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfour On the right track 
len ratingfour Crashes too often
len ratingfive  Best test tool provided by iOS 
len ratingfive Easy and efficient to use 
len ratingthree What is the invitation code 
len ratingfive Every team needs this 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingthree Can you pls send me a code
len ratingfive Love this app
len ratingone In the app store it says that the app is for year olds but in the app it says year olds 
len ratingone I am currently and wanted to get Discord Development 
len ratingone I am in fury right now know that I have had Discord since and i m still not able to get Discord Development 
len ratingfive Das dat crack
len ratingone This is the worst bc when I tried to find my invitation I couldn t and I don t know how to email the developers bc I don t have their email so EMAIL ME BACK ON THIS BC I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE HECK EVERYBODY ELSE CAN DO IT BUT ME
len ratingfive Best app ever
len ratingone It literally only has one option which is redeem 
len ratingone This is awful 
len ratingone I do not recommend 
len ratingone There should be a setting bar or a help bar because it doesn t even tell you how to use the app 
len ratingone Not sure why but TestFlight now can t load the app 
len ratingone It was working previously
len ratingfive Great I love being apart of the beta testing Snapchat is actually my most favorite app that I ve downloaded
len ratingone Anyone else unable to type vowels in their redemption code 
len ratingone Can t test the app I m trying to sign up for if I can t sign up for it 
len ratingtwo Loooong time user of this app 
len ratingtwo Over the years this app has always had some kind of usability kludge 
len ratingtwo As of this writing it s still showing expired builds and won t refresh 
len ratingfive I have finally been able to find many apps to participate in
len ratingone I downloaded this app bc I thought it would be cool to be a part of something but no now this is what it says every time I try to open tiktok TikTok Beta has expired WHY please help me get tiktok back NOW
len ratingfour Installation of test flight for the first time was simple and straight forward
len ratingfive Think this is a great app that lets you beta test almost anything form different companies best thing Apple made
len ratingfive I do not know any redeem codes and hints the title it won t tell me
len ratingfive Nothings happened yet
len ratingfive Great app nothing wrong at all
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive Please send me an email so I can redeem TestFlight
len ratingfive Quisiera que me llagara el c digo pero no lo hace y no se que hacer
len ratingone I can t even type in the code 
len ratingone I tried typing and copy pasting but it won t let me insert a code into the text box 
len ratingfive  Haven t used it yet I ll write another later
len ratingone I don t know how to get the redeem code someone please help me
len ratingone I can t get in
len ratingone I really was excited for the beta to be going to iPhone 
len ratingone I tried I TRIED 
len ratingone To sign up it was a hassle please Microsoft be relevant with us TRUE gamers you care about us gamers so make getting betas more easier would recommend to anyone who is trying another beta than xcloud I love betas when they work Thank you
len ratingone It starts out to be a great app 
len ratingone But after a while it starts to freeze when your doing the survey and not function of the app is really slow 
len ratingthree It s great Having this app to go to other apps 
len ratingthree But you have to be years old to access it and I m sure a lot of year old people have tried to get on but after wasting five ten minutes of your life it says To use TestFlight BetaTesting you must ve stop least years old
len ratingone  App stopped working days ago just get an error message on launch 
len ratingone No way to update beta apps for which new versions are out since TestFlight errors out even when following an email link to update a beta app 
len ratingfive Help me out ty
len ratingthree Still some buggy issues and missing features 
len ratingthree Don t know if notifications work until the build is live 
len ratingthree It would be great to be able to know if they re working prior to launching 
len ratingthree Sometimes new builds aren t in apps screen 
len ratingthree Can t share bug crash data through TestFlight for ad network and backend problems Fix these I m gonna star
len ratingone I should not need a code
len ratingfive Chicken go bok bok
len ratingone Latest versions are not matched each other
len ratingone Test Flight is constantly experiencing outages or delays in processing due to its incompetency 
len ratingone It has cost my business several customers due to its constant outages and inconsistent reliability 
len ratingone Builds rarely process sooner than two business days and there is little to no feedback on the status of processing or why the site is down 
len ratingone It says I need a code or I can t do anything so just wasted time downloading this
len ratingone I expired my latest build in AppStore Connect and uploaded a new one 
len ratingone AppStore Connect says the old build is expired and the new one is there but TestFlight continues to show the old one 
len ratingone Not only that 
len ratingone it happily installs the expired build like nothing happened 
len ratingone I have a release tomorrow and I can t install my freaking build to test it 
len ratingtwo  takes hours hours to update users in custom groups 
len ratingtwo Sometimes as late as week 
len ratingtwo You re better off using something else to share testers 
len ratingone Very unclear on how to join apps get redeem codes 
len ratingone Not quite sure what to do 
len ratingthree This app is simple to use but the wait to get the latest test version is exceedingly long 
len ratingthree Makes it difficult to test an app when speed is if the essence 
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingfive I highly recommend for those who have a lot of time on their hands 
len ratingfive Good way to introduce new ways to have fun or explore what the world has to offer I believe we all have something to prove to ourselves but rightfully for our mamas 
len ratingfive Be you be friendly be safe 
len ratingone I installed it and it says no apps can be detected at thus time
len ratingfive  Thank you
len ratingtwo Recording video from an iOS device is a necessary method for feedback 
len ratingtwo Yet The screenshot function only allows for photos 
len ratingone Even when there is a build available TF shows no build available for testing 
len ratingone In general whole developer workflow is klunky 
len ratingtwo I have not seen any applications available to load kind of a waist 
len ratingfive I have not had many major hiccups 
len ratingfive The app works just as well as the non beta version if not better 
len ratingfive Need to redeem the code
len ratingfive  Great 
len ratingfive I can see great profits made with this app
len ratingfive  Yesyesyesyes
len ratingfive Just what the world has been looking for
len ratingone Can t see any new builds 
len ratingone Expired builds still show to testers 
len ratingfive Buena
len ratingfive  Very nice 
len ratingfive My kids love it 
len ratingfive  stotm centre 
len ratingfive  Very good
len ratingfive Sensational 
len ratingfive And I m smarter 
len ratingfive Thank you math genius Chase Middleman 
len ratingfive I really love this app 
len ratingfive The drawings are exquisite 
len ratingfive I am a beginning birder and sometimes I find other bird depictions misleading 
len ratingfive The drawings on Flock look just like the birds in the real world 
len ratingfive The one thing that I think would make this app better is providing space for more than one list 
len ratingfive Thank you for including me 
len ratingfive I like podcasts but I don t like the podcast apps 
len ratingfive This will be the first podcast app I won t delete off my phone

len ratingfive Authentic

len ratingfive This app is quick fun and easy to use 
len ratingfive You re not an informed voter unless you re using this app 
len ratingfive Love
len ratingfive I enjoy TestFlight to allow the opportunity to download particular Apps normally unavailable on Apple iPad 
len ratingfive I ve noticed an increasingly more productive and secure way to work through the internet and manage my downloads faster cleaner images and an overall better quality way to spend d cadent time on the internet 
len ratingfive Thank You Respectfully BGMH
len ratingone  Is not opening at all this is bad 
len ratingfive Well

len ratingone I don t recommend this 
len ratingfive  This has really made running my business a ton easier 
len ratingfive No more taking my i pad with me 
len ratingfive So far so good let s hope it last
len ratingfive I ve it
len ratingfive This is starting to shape up as a very useful and nicely designed app for skiing snowboarding in the Aspen area 
len ratingone Will only show older builds 
len ratingone Very frustrating 
len ratingfive  Love it makes me lazy on Craigslist
len ratingone The app wouldn t let me use it 
len ratingfive I can t to open the app TestFlight 
len ratingfive Always ask me about the code on the redeem 
len ratingfive How I make to work this app again Thanks
len ratingone My redemption will not email to me 
len ratingfour  TikTok is funny inspirational and can t stop watching kinda app 
len ratingone App Store Connect says No Builds Available without a sufficient explanation
len ratingone I have been on this app and it has not gave me games I don t prefer for you to play it you won t like it
len ratingone I thought I could do this on my phone and tablet for township 
len ratingone Apparently I can not and now I can t use my game on my tablet which is my main platform for playing 
len ratingone How do I quit being a tester 
len ratingfive I can t get the Apple screensaver wallpaper
len ratingone  Downloaded the app and there was nothing to test per the message on the screen 
len ratingone There s a capability to redeem an authorization code but no info on how to do this 
len ratingone Seems like a premature announcement which really didn t provide mr with much faith going forward
len ratingone Your company is confusing and all you have are scamming Indian dudes 
len ratingfive I love this game
len ratingfive The information offered in this app has changed the way I plan my flights 
len ratingfive Well done AirWaze 
len ratingfive Can i have a code please
len ratingfive It s great for helping other grow and connect you with apps you couldn t without the help of test flight
len ratingfive  Love the concept and the mission behind this 
len ratingfive Keep going guys 
len ratingfive Lot s of features are still missing but with a good community this will help a lot 
len ratingone Too complicated to download
len ratingfive It will be fun
len ratingone Despite my being connected to the internet 
len ratingone Totally useless as such 
len ratingone  Copy
len ratingfive The Best Photo Postcard app ever 
len ratingfive Love the fact that they keep adding new features like reusing postcards and now the ability to personalize your messages when sending to multiple people
len ratingfive Been beta testing and the support is great quick to help if issues and easy to use app
len ratingtwo The entire TestFlight process is difficult to navigate especially when multiple release candidates are involved i e 
len ratingtwo app updates occur 
len ratingtwo When all about s are submitted and testers assigned email notices are sent immediately but in reality testers will not see apps in TestFlight until submitted apps have passed apple s review process a second email gets sent at this time 
len ratingtwo Apps that are updates may not appear if tester is testing previous app candidate 
len ratingtwo Resend invite option seems to be unavailable for some users I haven t figured out the logic yet 
len ratingtwo In summary TestFlight has a monopoly on Apple testing so we muddle through but the is so much room for improvements in the use experience that it only warrants stars IMO 
len ratingfive Fast and smooth love it
len ratingone  Thankful for this app
len ratingtwo Glad to be part of the beta on this 
len ratingtwo App has potential though a ways to go to get to that potential 
len ratingtwo Definitely not my default app for tracking my travel activity 
len ratingtwo I have confidence SWA will eventually nail this down 
len ratingtwo Their existing mobile app is GR I m sure they ll get this new app to that level as well 
len ratingone I got a new phone and restored my Information from an iCloud backup hoping that this would still work 
len ratingone I was mistaken 
len ratingone The apps downloaded but TestFlight did not recognize the apps I had redeemed for beta testing so I was unable to update the apps even though the beta apps were pushing for new updates through TestFlight 
len ratingone Great idea but poor execution 
len ratingone It says then when I get on to the app it says I have to be OVER 
len ratingfive  I am on the latest version of BBM for iOS and have the problems below 
len ratingfive When I am out of the BBM app I do not receive any notifications 
len ratingfive To see my messages I have to open the app and then they all come in 
len ratingfive Reception is very good 
len ratingfive  the other problem is when I try to send messages 
len ratingfive The intended recipient does not get them until I make a BBM call to them and hang up 
len ratingfive Then I see Delivered indicators 
len ratingfive  Before I call I see only ticks 
len ratingfive After I make the call I see D s 
len ratingfive Again I have good internet 
len ratingone Get Beta full yet I cannot get past app to install my office 
len ratingone Get me out of this mess

len ratingfive Shout out to Facebook too for making React Native 
len ratingfive  Great thank you
len ratingfive Waze is the best mapping software available and thanks for the opportunity to improve it with Test Flight 
len ratingfive I have not found a competitor the equal of Waze 
len ratingfive Thanks for such a high quality product 
len ratingone  This is gay like apple
len ratingfive  This app is hot for sneaker heads and helps you see the value of your perfect or torn up shoe the app is great 
len ratingfive Great app

len ratingfive Celebrate the winner with your own trophy and look forward to next years competition 
len ratingfive Well I m so glad to see this feature sorry to say it cuts out while using talk to text 
len ratingfive Allows for easy feedback from test users I think the App Store should implement some of TestFlights feedback mechanics because they are awesome
len ratingfive This app rocks 
len ratingfive I can recommend movies to friends abd keep a watchlist 
len ratingone When I try to play rec room it always says on the bottom that rec room needs a update 
len ratingone I recently download this app on my phone and I looked on the AppStore checking it s aging rating which is but when I go into the app it says I have to be years old and there is not anything inappropriate about the app 
len ratingone Ok if I could get in the app that would be perfect I have to be but powder app gave the link so I can alpha test this please fix you app it says plus
len ratingone I get locked out when the Beta version expires

len ratingfive Whenever I need to de stress and relax I listen to one of the many great sessions 
len ratingfive It works every time 
len ratingfive Whenever I have trouble falling asleep it s def my go to once I say my prayers 
len ratingfive The training programs teach you all you need to know to utilize relaxing meditation whenever and wherever you are even if you only have a few short minutes 
len ratingfive And it s not the weird meditation where you focus on a deity you just focus on your breathing 
len ratingfive The single sessions let you choose what your main objective is for that session

len ratingfive This is an amazing app
len ratingfive This a great database for those who are heavy into teaching and preaching Gods word

len ratingfive  this app is super fun and amazing you can make tons of videos with different sounds
len ratingfour I love to play this game and now I can t somehow inflight testers have blocked my game very sad player
len ratingfive Great way to track apps you re testing while also giving you quick ways to report bugs and read patch notes for most of your favorite apps 
len ratingfive I usually have a rough time with giving feedback for apps have public test builds 
len ratingfive But TestFlight gives me a way to keep them all together also great for if you transfer phones and want to continue testing 
len ratingfive Highly recommended for all tech nerds 
len ratingfive  This is very comprehensive well organized glitch free and easy to use app 
len ratingfive The app helps in keeping u on path of spiritual and self progress 
len ratingfive Features like RAK Random act of Kindness stories encourage you every day to step out of ur comfort zone to help someone everyday person to make this world a better place

len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive My whole family including my year old uses everyday for morning meditations 
len ratingfive Great tool
len ratingone App is no good without redeem code and did not get the email that included it 
len ratingone Deleted app to try again and app opens as if it was never deleted
len ratingone Why do you have to be when it says I don t understand
len ratingfive  Til tok make me so happy I love making videos
len ratingthree  On this Christmas Day I join and download these apps and there are no apps or anything for me to test or try 
len ratingthree Why is that 
len ratingfive It s a good app but why do we need to do all this stuff to get a code I wish it would be a little easier instead of going to different websites for different codes
len ratingfive  Hhh
len ratingfive Not to bad
len ratingfour There is entirely to much reading 
len ratingfour And I had a mission of collecting pearls 
len ratingfour I believe there was a typo because it wanted me to collect pearls in days 
len ratingfour Wow 
len ratingfour Also the regatta has some tasks that are completely greyed out 
len ratingone I opted in for testing and had trouble with playing my game 
len ratingone I then clicked on the link to stop testing and now I can t access my game at all 
len ratingone  plus years of lost progress and abandoning my team in the middle of a regatta 
len ratingone I m beyond upset
len ratingtwo  And let meIdk how get emails
len ratingfive Can I offer a suggestion 
len ratingfive Is there a way to avoid having to add my email address every time 
len ratingfive Maybe make my address sticky with a radio button next to it 
len ratingfive Or some other way to use my address without having to retype it every time 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingthree Ok so in the apple store it says but when you enter the app I explains that you need to be I think apple should change the age or they change it to 
len ratingone Sounded interesting but either I don t know how to get myself invited or there s nothing to test out there in Apple land 
len ratingfive  Sounds promising 
len ratingfive I love it SO much 
len ratingthree  Every time I try increasing its functionality through various installs I only encounter broken functions and endless waits 
len ratingfive Just another INNOVATOR creating an App that is needed by users that the big players won t develop natively 
len ratingfive BIG THANKS to the developer 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive Review
len ratingone I never got an activation code 
len ratingone I entered my email and nothing happened
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive I like Betas 
len ratingfive This app let s you run them 
len ratingfive The only thing that would make it better would be auto updating 
len ratingfive It d be nice if Apple allowed that 
len ratingfive By far the cleanest and most useful reddit client out there 
len ratingfive It simply has everything you could need 
len ratingone I just want Snapchat and It is full star
len ratingfive That s bbeatiful
len ratingfive This app works great for the beta versions of the apps 
len ratingfive It s seats to use and can deliver the test versions easily 
len ratingfive As an end user I like this simplicity 
len ratingone Been denied access to any apps
len ratingfour  I don t mean to sound snobby but a button that updates every app would be nice
len ratingfive Good app
len ratingtwo Me pide canjear la aplicaci n
len ratingfive Very convenient 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Does this go to the apple store reviews section 
len ratingone I just downloaded the test flight app and opened and next thing I see is a review 
len ratingone How can I give feedback on something I have not yet used 
len ratingone Looks like a little bug in your user journey design 
len ratingone YOU WILL NOT SHARE ANY PROCEEDS YET YOU WILL DO THE WORK FOR THOSE WHO WILL GET PAID FOR THE APP THAT MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IF NOT FOR YOU 
len ratingone THEY WILL CHARGE YOU HUGE SUMS OF MONEY TO USE THE APP THAT YOU HELPED TO DEVELOP 
len ratingone NOT IN MY WORLD 
len ratingone WHEN I BUILD A HOUSE NOBODY IS GOING TO THEREAFTER SELL IT TO ME OR CHARGE ME TO USE IT 
len ratingone STOP THE TREND BEFORE IT STARTS 
len ratingone ITS A SCAM AT MINIMUM 
len ratingone I downloaded it and then deleted and my phone bill was saying that I had to pay a month do not download 
len ratingfive  Good for beta testing or if you want to play around 
len ratingone I can t use the letter E Y U I and all numbers 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive This service has improved greatly 
len ratingfive It is fast and interactive now 
len ratingthree My code isn t working
len ratingfive Love this ios synth on the iPad and desktop love how it was ported to the iphone love the micro GUI interface it s easy to start creating patches this is great 
len ratingfive Fantastic app 
len ratingfive This allowed me to get to everything I need in just seconds 
len ratingfive WOW 
len ratingfive Making my home based business even more efficient 
len ratingfive Thanks Rank Makers 
len ratingfive  Best app
len ratingfive A 
len ratingfive  Really nice
len ratingfive Great and easy to use design 
len ratingfive Loved it 
len ratingfive Totally recommend
len ratingone The app age requirement is and I m but it keeps telling me I have to be when I try to open the app
len ratingfive I am looking forward to using and reviewing in TestFlight 
len ratingtwo For at least the last months I have been trying to impress upon your developers the incredible disfunction of the app in combination with the driver app 
len ratingtwo I really don t think anyone is listening or cares about this issue because it is STILL the main problem with the app 
len ratingtwo It can often take minutes from the time I pick up the rider before the appropriate navigation to the destination is displayed 
len ratingtwo I often must confirm that I have picked up the rider more than once before it presents the navigation instructions 
len ratingtwo This issue with switching back and forth between the app amp the navigation is deplorable and needs some serious attention 
len ratingtwo I continue to be disappointed in the ability of your developers to address this important issue 
len ratingtwo I encourage your organization to acquire some competent app software assistance ASAP 
len ratingfive The ODIN app is easy to install and setup 
len ratingfive I was connected to my site in seconds 
len ratingfive Very easy to view all of my HVAC systems including trends schedules and alarms 
len ratingfive This app is a home run 
len ratingfive For anyone who wants to efficiently and safely deal with passwords this is the app to get 
len ratingfive This is a great new creation for those of us that enjoy life 
len ratingthree I don t know how long I ve had this installed but not once have I received a request to test an app 
len ratingthree I believe I was invited to the app initially so it s all the more ironic I ve had nothing happen since 
len ratingthree Maybe a developer can fill me in on what s going on and how I can be involved 
len ratingthree  So I was invited to the beta testing app 
len ratingthree I download the app but I didn t get a code maybe I did something wrong but I d like to participate if still available
len ratingone Nothing to review
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone  I really want to love this product 
len ratingone The potential is amazing and for the first few months it worked great 
len ratingone Now all we seem to experience are terrible issues with the app not working 
len ratingone It always seems to start out great at the beginning of the night but shortly after the sound For the camera stops working and will continue to in and out throughout the night 
len ratingone The sock is constantly searching for the base station 
len ratingone I know our internet connection is not the issues either because we have a separate router and extender specific for the camera owlet 
len ratingone Very disappointed in customer service as they always repeats the name uninstall and reinstall app restart your internet routine 
len ratingone Really hoping owlet figures it stuff out because I was looking forward to purchasing for both my sisters but will definitely be rethinking after the headache it s been causing us 
len ratingfive Mobile app is excellent 
len ratingfive The web browser has more features I m hopeful will added soon 
len ratingone Have to cancel ride after ride while dropping off a passenger at the airport and heading for the queue all over minutes away 
len ratingone Really 
len ratingone Unable to add promo code
len ratingfive I ve used this app for at least a year now and have found it always working perfectly 
len ratingfive What more can you ask for 
len ratingfive NADA 
len ratingfive It works flawlessly 
len ratingfive If you ve ever been worried about being a beta tester there isn t anything that s ever happened during my time using it to cause me concern 
len ratingfive So as far as with the app I m testing no problems 
len ratingfive As far as the TestFlight app no problem 
len ratingfive Try it if you get a chance 
len ratingfive I have used this app for two years 
len ratingfive I wish I have discovered it sooner 
len ratingfive Allows me to manage my two teams 
len ratingfive Love the new D field view and the ability to swap players in field view 
len ratingfive More features available that I don t currently use 
len ratingone I was trying to get tik toc but it never worked What do i do
len ratingfive Use this to test your apps 
len ratingfive  Cool
len ratingfive Super fast 
len ratingfive Since Xcode x was release uploading to the AppStore is super fast 
len ratingfive How fast is it 
len ratingfive Prior I would get email notification updates within minutes 
len ratingfive Now notifications are arriving within min sometimes less 
len ratingone Garbage 
len ratingone Makes the app unable to work at all 
len ratingfour Great app for testing apps in development 
len ratingfour I wish the welcome wouldn t pop up so often multiple times a week 
len ratingfive Esta bueno
len ratingfour Work in progress but very good and getting there 
len ratingfive This app is really good to know if something coming is game should be acceptable or not
len ratingone Please add a feature to auto download all new versions of test apps 
len ratingone Manually updating them all of the time is a huge annoying hassle 
len ratingfive Can t use this
len ratingone Test Flight totally destroyed my NYT app 
len ratingone It hasn t been updated for hours 
len ratingone Don t put out a new version on Friday if you can t provide tech support over the weekend 
len ratingfive Every health app I ve ever tried to use has been impossible to customize 
len ratingfive This ones easy to use and easy to customize 
len ratingfive Very good app for meet new people
len ratingfive Gee things just keep getting better and better all the time thank you
len ratingfive You really feel like you re gliding and flying in Repulsive 
len ratingfive The movement is exhilarating and the game can be as challenging or relaxingly playful as you want 
len ratingfive Two thumbs up 
len ratingone We have been dealing with nonstop updates and delay 
len ratingone Please 
len ratingone Get it together 
len ratingfive Amazing app 
len ratingfive I love this app so many great betas 
len ratingfive App functions flawlessly and hopefully helps development 
len ratingfour Idk
len ratingthree It works 
len ratingthree I have more things to say about the apps I test 
len ratingfive Awesome job 
len ratingfive Excellent application 
len ratingfive EXCELENTE para la difusi n pr ctica del conocimiento de la Divina Voluntad 
len ratingfive  there are opportunities for improvement Screen Recordings On the iPhone it is very easy to show app behavior by turning on Screen Recording While showing buggy or strange app behavior 
len ratingfive  Even the ability to send multiple photos would be an improvement 
len ratingfive  It would be helpful if past feedback was kept and visible to the customer like past message communications are kept when you message sometime 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work Ray
len ratingfour Why when I launch the app from a notification does it show the app I tapped then flash and snap back to the main list 
len ratingfour Pretty dang clowny 
len ratingfive  Very fast 
len ratingone Testing an app that has a VPN will render further updates completely unable to complete 
len ratingfive I enjoy getting the latest updates and providing insight TestFlight makes it easy to do this 
len ratingone We should not be limited to only seeing the last builds 
len ratingone It should be more like 
len ratingone We pay for a service to keep things pure 
len ratingone But with this comes the inability to function properly 
len ratingone This is especially true when the Beta whatever thing expires why does it expire anyway 
len ratingone It doesn t work like its supposed to 
len ratingone So my browser expires 
len ratingone I try to update it but there is nothing to update 
len ratingone Now I have no usable internet which I use frequently for work 
len ratingone I may not be able to see anything bad on my phone but I can t see ANYTHING at all so now it s just a iseless service that I pay for 
len ratingone I got the app and it said ages and when I got into the app it said I needed to be over 
len ratingfive Meets all my needs 
len ratingone  Very slow and takes a while to load I have a app that updates every day and it takes minutes to load every time I open the app I restart my phone does not help I reset my phone does not help
len ratingfive I Love Free EDITOR Infor 
len ratingone I have tried to find a way and am unable to delete this 
len ratingone I don t want it on my phone
len ratingfive  Great for swapping info quick 
len ratingone You guys send me to test the Uber app but I already have so thanks
len ratingone If your gonna put its recommended for ages four and up then don t have people download the app just to be told you need to be older than thirteen for this app
len ratingfive Roblox is the best I m sorry
len ratingfive  very good
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfour Epic
len ratingfive  Bxhdh

len ratingone So I was a beta tester for your township it crashed and had to reinstall now I lost everything and I can t get back in with you guys to fix it because it s full this is bs
len ratingfive Hay
len ratingfive The absolute best tool on market to train pitch recognition
len ratingfive It s amazing and I love the app 
len ratingone The App doesn t want to work on my phone and it just does not cooperate wouldn t even give it one star
len ratingfive OMG THIS IS THE BEST
len ratingfive  Great for kids
len ratingone The redeem codes can t be entered properly on my iPad Air running OS It uses ALL CAPS no matter what including cut and paste 
len ratingone Useless app
len ratingfive Twahjy hiid stuj
len ratingthree Then every app on the iOS store should have the dev code listed or the the ability to call developers from the app should be available 
len ratingthree The app just says redeem and shows a blank screen 
len ratingfour  It s ok
len ratingfive I love Apple and Mac mostly because they cost more than any device which it s worth
len ratingfive Love it
len ratingfive Love testing with this app
len ratingfive  Must have app
len ratingfive  Yes
len ratingfive Just excited to check out this app 
len ratingfive I am sure I will have more to say once I start exploring
len ratingfive  I just want to get fandoms and for tik tok to follow me
len ratingone I m not familiar with this but it should be simplified more
len ratingone Hate apple now that the jobs croaked What a waste of time 
len ratingfive An excellent approach to private communications without being subject to the public gaze memorializing or hacking less so at a minimum 
len ratingfive Get it 
len ratingone Make app called osu
len ratingfive I love my Jaybird Vistas 
len ratingfive The app is easy and fun to use with my wireless earbuds 
len ratingfour karafs
len ratingone I dont know how to dark mode tik tok
len ratingone How do I stop the app from coming on your phone after deleting it so may times 
len ratingone I downloaded and opened now it just shows the redeem screen
len ratingone After i reviewed it they removed me from the testing 
len ratingone Maybe i reviewed something wrong but they didn t exactly tell me what i was reviewing in the app 
len ratingone I definitely am not gonna try this again anytime soon 
len ratingfive  I ve been waiting for this app 
len ratingfive It s brilliantly created amp gives a objective way to track happiness 
len ratingfive Great work to the creator
len ratingone Need a code
len ratingfive  Nice
len ratingfive  bjubbj
len ratingthree  Just loaded the app now it wants to be rated 
len ratingthree So three stars the download was quick 
len ratingone You asked me to download this app i did it then when I open you ask me for invitation code 
len ratingone But don t get one from you 
len ratingtwo Downloaded TestFlight it says a code wat is the talking about I did wat the township said and nuthin
len ratingfive  It s great I love how easy it is to use and very relaxing and fun for everyday life thank you so very much
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive I love the app 
len ratingfive Keeps beta apps easy and safe and idk what to say
len ratingfive  Easy to use
len ratingone It says it s but in the app it says you must be but for TikTok if it s connected it should show that it s but yet it still doesn t 
len ratingfive Why am I asked to rate an Apple app 
len ratingfive  Once more time spent my review will be updated but so far it s great 
len ratingfive  Awoken I love it
len ratingfive  Followed instructions cat ended up in toaster
len ratingone Doesn t do anything except says no apps to test
len ratingfive Indeed
len ratingthree  Not a good app very difficult to navigate
len ratingfive Not as good as it was before Apple acquired it but still handy nonetheless 
len ratingfive Wish test deployments were instant 
len ratingfive Takes too long to notify users if at all 
len ratingfive Can please get dark mode on TikTok
len ratingone  No apps available brought here by another app it s probably a scam be careful
len ratingone  Don t know how this app
len ratingone It s expensive but what makes me mad is it locks u out of your app
len ratingtwo I think we are mature enough to be able to do this 
len ratingtwo I came from tik tok to join the testers but right when I downloaded it when I clicked continue it said that we had to be or older 
len ratingtwo Aren t and older mature enough 
len ratingtwo well I could have rated it a star if I could access it but no 
len ratingone App is keep getting freeze 
len ratingone Everytime have to force stop it in order to work
len ratingfive This is good for getting games that haven t came out yet 
len ratingfive Great Product Everyone should try it 
len ratingone Moral and ethical concerns 
len ratingone Where do I get an invite code 
len ratingone Can t even type in my code
len ratingfive  C mo puedo obtener un c digo de invitaci n para instalar Siju
len ratingfive It helps me get the app out there efficiently 
len ratingfive  Can t wait to drop feed back and test out beta apps
len ratingfive  Wouldn t it be nice if the testers maybe got payed a little something for doing this 
len ratingfive I know it s not hard but also the work is done through our apps and info we send 
len ratingfive Just a though bit not a big deal but would be sokoto consider 
len ratingfive Maybe a gift card to somewhere would be nice 
len ratingfive Just shows a little appreciation makes the people feel better 
len ratingfive I m a senior manufacturing engineer in the SF Bay Area 
len ratingfive I do work in one of the big tech giants 
len ratingfive Like a said it s not the money just the though and action is what makes it for most
len ratingfive This app is so amazing not only does it fix me a sandwich wirelessly it also lets me leave the kids at home while I go and sit at the park staring at the pollution in the grey skies 
len ratingfive I mean come on 
len ratingfive It s such a great deal 
len ratingfive It even has a secret feature that lets you make Wendy s salty fries bearable to eat 
len ratingfive I couldn t ask for more and neither could my year old son and year old daughter when they get to be home alone and put forks in microwaves to see the shiny little lights 
len ratingfive If this was payable I would be broke 
len ratingfive Follow me on Instagram skondior 
len ratingfive Very good improvement of the mobile app 
len ratingfive This is what everyone should have in there home 
len ratingtwo I want to become part of the tiktok testers program so I download this app it says but when I enter in it says I must be or older I m and play assassins creed for goodness sake
len ratingone No deber a ser por invitaci n
len ratingfour Program very seldom works at a speed that is acceptable and often does not load at all 
len ratingfour Direction of view is seldom correct yet when taking field pictures 
len ratingfour This will be an awesome tool when it is perfected 
len ratingfour I need patience 
len ratingfour Keep up the good work 
len ratingfive  Awesome app go keto family 
len ratingfive Slimfast your the best and always make losing weight so fun and easy and not just that healthy 
len ratingfive And delicious 
len ratingfive Alertmeter is product of many years of research and experience in industrial safety 
len ratingfive But anyone who does anything hazardous including driving should use this app 
len ratingfive Makes it very straightforward when additional versions of software are to be downloaded tested always with a notification reminding me to do so 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingone War of thrones game stopped working after years of playing 
len ratingone Never got test flight update 
len ratingthree There is nothing to test
len ratingfive  Easy to use
len ratingfive This is nice very nice
len ratingfive My like 
len ratingfive Truly gives freedom in worship at the tips of your fingers 
len ratingfive With out the bulky computers or extensive programming 
len ratingone As soon as I join the app it says no apps available
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive  APP APP APP 
len ratingone  It says full 
len ratingone First of all I ve been trying to get TikTok to turn dark and I tired this app and it showed tik tok so I m like oh great and I try it it doesn t work
len ratingone Why
len ratingfive The game involves both strategy and skill in battle 
len ratingfive You go from four characters to eight as you earn skills 
len ratingfive There are healers archers Knights Cardinals and many other characters with a range of protection powers and lives 
len ratingfive There are missions and portals to get rewards 
len ratingfive I have beaten the game in regular and hard core mode on both IOS and Android 
len ratingfive Beta is fire
len ratingfive Fasil de usar y muy completa
len ratingfive  DARK MODE ON TIKTOK THIS HELP ALOT 
len ratingone The app isn t loading not on the invitation game
len ratingfive First time to use it 
len ratingfive Really cool and easy
len ratingfive  It always let u have dark mode
len ratingone I want my township game on both phones and it will not work On my LG now Why 
len ratingfive Love getting beta apps 
len ratingone Null
len ratingfive  I ve been meditating through my adult life and usually had to seek out teachers for many reasons but the teachings here are concise and easy yet powerful for all levels 
len ratingfive TestFlight just works 
len ratingfive Great job 
len ratingfive Magnifico e inigualable
len ratingfive Muy buena aplicaci n interesante y sobre todo puedo ayudar a muchas m s personas a que disfruten al m ximo 
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingfive So amazing how your feed changes as you go from one location to another 
len ratingfive What to see what is happing around you 
len ratingone There are not many concepts in play here there are users they are part of groups and they have access to different apps 
len ratingone It is so hard to invite a user 
len ratingone You have to invite them once to the developer program then after they join and verify their email you have to invite them again to be an iTunes TestFlight tester 
len ratingone Both of these steps are not obvious at all 
len ratingone Then once they join they might already be logged in to the TestFlight app with that email address but for some reason they have to redeem a code before they can see their new membership 
len ratingone Figuring out why a new user can t see the app you want them to test is SO OPAQUE 
len ratingone It might be because they are on step one of two of the invite process or it might be because they didn t redeem a code or because the build hasn t finished processing or because you need to finish the encryption compliance flow 
len ratingone If your goal is to prevent me from adding more testers you have succeeded 
len ratingone I would prefer to not add any more testers because it s a process that can easily rob me of hours of my time only because TestFlight is so poorly designed 
len ratingtwo This is a pointless app that loses a customer 
len ratingtwo Why make the pathway to download hard and a wall 
len ratingtwo Taking min to find way out and restart 
len ratingone I never got the code
len ratingfive Valuable tool for therapist to use with their clients and for individuals to use to learn more about their feelings and emotions 
len ratingfive Need some tests
len ratingone What the heck
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive  Coding
len ratingtwo Never once have had an app to test
len ratingone Invite emails never arrive on time
len ratingfive Yasaman
len ratingfive Well I wrote it so I better love it lol
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingone  Waste of time and life
len ratingone No instruction how to start
len ratingfive Plz help
len ratingone It asks if I am enjoying the app immediately after downloading before I have used it 
len ratingone No enjoyment in downloading 
len ratingfive Great app to keep track of goalies goals 
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingone Where s the beef
len ratingone For some people updates are displaying and for me I have to ask for dev team
len ratingfive This is allot more usable than vemno for family and friends 
len ratingfive Also a great way to keep budgets and teach kids to budget 
len ratingfive Love The New Jelli App
len ratingfour Can t use because it hangs and then times out
len ratingone  It doesn t work
len ratingone Was done beta testing so deleted app on s 
len ratingone Deleted the app I was testing as well as TestFlight 
len ratingone Did a hard restart of phone only to have the TestFlight app return 
len ratingone I am unable to open it 
len ratingone I am unable to delete it in the various ways possible 
len ratingone The icon just stays on the home screen 
len ratingone There is a new build available for the app I was testing but I can t access 
len ratingfive It is a dream app for all to cheers when not together
len ratingfive So good bro 
len ratingfive This App is amazing and so is this florist 
len ratingfive Highly recommend

len ratingfive It was interesting to participate in testing process 
len ratingfive Thank you for inviting me 
len ratingone The app does nothing
len ratingone It gave me no instructions nor show tell me what I was supposed to be doing with it 
len ratingone I don t know what it wants me to do 
len ratingone So thanks for nothing 
len ratingone If I could give it zero stars I would have 
len ratingfive  Simple and easy to follow instructions for installation
len ratingone How do you use this app 
len ratingone Where do I get a testers code 
len ratingfive Garmroodi
len ratingfive Street deals is the ideal solution for merchants looking to drive traffic to their stores 
len ratingone Takes over a minute to load a list of apps and sometimes fails 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingone  Won t let me go home
len ratingone Give me acsess to somthing and i will work with u
len ratingfive Best App easy to use and make good money and boys are great and very helpful
len ratingone Doesn t work
len ratingthree Too complicated 
len ratingfive Wow this is awesome 
len ratingfour Overall great testing app but if you upload a package it s supposed to send your testers an email 
len ratingfour Instead I have to delete all my testers re add them and then it sends the password for TestFlight 
len ratingfive I have enjoyed using TestFlight and being able to test beta products 
len ratingfive It is a great experience to give feedback on products before they are used 
len ratingfive  VPN VPN 
len ratingfive Cheers to modernizing CCC hymn books

len ratingone I dont know what I am supposed to do with this app 
len ratingfive Gung

len ratingfive It s great and awesome
len ratingfive This app rocks our company 
len ratingfive TestFlight is easy to use for new users 
len ratingfive Users are made aware when a new version is available for testing which makes it convenient for the developers without having to send notices out to everyone 
len ratingone I don t know how this works 
len ratingone And there s nothing ever available to review or whatever
len ratingthree  I cant use the beta for Snapchat cuz all the link does is bring me to the App Store rather than bring me into the app itself
len ratingfive The single best fleet fuel payment decision I made for my business 
len ratingfive Drivers are saving time reducing liability on our vehicles more awareness when fueling less drivers stranded at the fuel pumps I could go on and on the app is easy to use and so intuitive 
len ratingone I open app for the new runescape beta and received no selections at all after opening 
len ratingfive I don t understand why I was dropped from the testing and now I cannot play the game on my phone I can only play on my iPad
len ratingone Repeated attempts to activate light therapy for jet lag has failed 
len ratingone On activating the program with tapping no sign seen that states Light therapy in progress on the screen 
len ratingone So far Adjustment after multiple attempts though on repeat tapping states program running on the mask 
len ratingone Multiple international travel with failure of the light therapy to perform 
len ratingone George Thomas
len ratingfive It s Great game addictive 
len ratingtwo No puedo descargar lo que quiero
len ratingone it s not sending ANY emails to my inbox to get my code 
len ratingfive Outstanding app the most creative way of telling the story of Earth 
len ratingfive Once started I couldn t stop listening and walking 
len ratingone Following instructions to load Smartfind Express 
len ratingone Msg says no apps to test 
len ratingfive The statistics available from the app are as valuable as its game playing purpose 
len ratingfive Once in the user can assess their performance in a variety of ways 
len ratingfive The club can even award members for their year end statistical results 
len ratingfive What s next a putting lesson

len ratingfive Hands down the best meditation experience out there 
len ratingone Not working
len ratingone I haven t received code
len ratingone  I am currently using an old account for I don t have a new one and I m way over but the app keeps telling me that I must be over is it broken or something 
len ratingone I m just confused 
len ratingone When I try to redeem a code it only lets me type in one letter 
len ratingone Completely broken junk
len ratingfive good good
len ratingfour  Tik ToK is a great platform for the world community to share experiences and their personal view of life on our sphere 
len ratingthree Hello 
len ratingthree This app is wonderful I use it for plenty of movies 
len ratingthree The only problem is that I purchased a annual good quality and now I had updated my phone 
len ratingthree And for some reason when I click verify it does not work please work on fixing this problem 
len ratingthree But otherwise I love this app 
len ratingfive This app will help AHO reach thousands of youth throughout CA who are struggling 
len ratingfour So I don t know how the app is but it says ages but when I clicked continue it said I had to be at least years old 
len ratingone My camera stopped working months ago 
len ratingone It only records my path and no longer records live 
len ratingone Nowhere in the description of this app say you are required to be years of age and this is absurd 
len ratingone I have to wait years to use this
len ratingtwo my code doesn t work

len ratingfive I appreciate the notification 
len ratingfive I am enjoying the test streaming device 
len ratingfive Everything is working well 
len ratingone It wastes my time by not letting users test the apps quickly
len ratingone Hi It states that you must be or older to use the app and I find that kind of irritating especially for someone like me who now can t change the date BECUASE it was the wrong year 
len ratingone Please I understand this app needs to be that way but if it s not including to a younger audience normally it s not all inclusive 
len ratingone Please fix this or just let me download the app and also it says that the developer only has access to name and email which is bogus
len ratingfive Test Flight delivers updates to my scheduler works every time 
len ratingfive Lit app will be the future
len ratingone This app wants me code while it hasn t gone me any code 
len ratingone Thank

len ratingone Nothing to indicate it isn t working as the game isn t even available in the second device 
len ratingone I hate this because i m not allowed to even get on 
len ratingone I was so excited so download this just to be disappointed

len ratingfive Bravo 
len ratingfive What we need An Update All Button A way to find TestFlights starting with apps you have installed and TestFlight can read that 
len ratingfive If it can t yet Apple Apps have been granted powers before 
len ratingfive Here s a good use case

len ratingone Confusing in design lacking in features 
len ratingone Terrible 
len ratingone Website is very hard to navigate
len ratingtwo I m glad that we can participate in beta programs for apps but I m also confused why I need a separate app to install and subscribe to them 
len ratingtwo Why not build the beta features into the regular App Store and allow people to manage the beta apps from there 
len ratingtwo It would be so incredible if you would integrate it like this 
len ratingfive Test
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It s so nice to be able to document my work report and clock in and not have to submit my recap and hours at the end of the week

len ratingfive  Loved the beta for TestFlight too 
len ratingthree Every week I get ride requests that I answer and the system fails to complete it and sends the message that something went wrong 
len ratingthree Today it happened for three rides in a row 
len ratingthree It happens far too frequently to be ignored 
len ratingthree I have pictures of some of them and have registered my concern before but apparently it s not a high priority item 
len ratingfive Awesome game
len ratingone Not useful
len ratingone I was directed by Ring to download this app in order to participate in their testing program 
len ratingone One was Rapid Ring and the other was Ring Always Home 
len ratingone The second has an update that I need to download but it won t finish so I m stuck 
len ratingthree  I just downloaded the new beta testing and I put report a problem and it says oops there s something wrong 
len ratingthree So I guess that s a coincidence lol 
len ratingthree Another thing is I would like to delete all of any of my conversations with anybody AT ONCE

len ratingfour  It would be good if you don t even have to write down the redeem code when you are invited to test an app 
len ratingfour It would be better if it somehow gets that you ve been invited automatically from your email or something 
len ratingfive So I m still waiting for the tik tok beta tester for me but so far I like this
len ratingfive thanks a lot for making this app now I can play all apps for iOS I used this to download discorder and it was amazing without this app I would have never been able to play discorder so thanks a lot for making this app 
len ratingone Please fix this feature 
len ratingone It is essential for testing using TestFlight 
len ratingone I don t get the notifications and emails anymore 
len ratingone Both my TestFlight notification settings and my application notifications settings are set to receive push and email notifications but they rarely come 
len ratingone When they do come they are days to weeks late 
len ratingone This is a legitimate problem 
len ratingfive This is a wonderful fun game with a competitive advanced type of game style that can be enjoyed by everyone 
len ratingone Very disappointed
len ratingfour This app is very useful and the creator did a great job he s always working that helped out 
len ratingfour Thanks again
len ratingfive  Dungchuot
len ratingthree It keeps saying that I have no apps available 
len ratingthree I haven t had an update on Snapchat in about two weeks 
len ratingthree It s saying that I have to update the app but Snapchat won t even show up
len ratingone I m years old and I saw that that TestFlight is so I downloaded it and it said it was for 
len ratingfive Yasha y all should keep this baby version beta 
len ratingone I m having problems completing the initial install 
len ratingone The send button was grayed out 
len ratingone I ve downloaded the TestFlight app now I m trying to download the lightning app and it s on able to do it 
len ratingfive Olloh fayz barokat bersin 
len ratingfive Whoever designed this thing should get a raise 
len ratingfive Hi I m looking pls
len ratingfive  Thanks for trusting my ideas 
len ratingthree I was asked to do the J J Scout beta 
len ratingthree I was halfway through it a diary you do daily and now when I click to do the daily task it says it s expired 
len ratingthree When I open Test Flight the only thing showing there says there is no apps available now 
len ratingthree There is no place to question or find help 
len ratingfive  Great and easy to use design 
len ratingfive Loved it
len ratingone TestFlight has been buggy and unreliable since the last update 
len ratingone At times I can t even get the apps to load 
len ratingone Apple you can do better than this 
len ratingone Come on 
len ratingone  This app will get your personal information for a cents literally and who knows when or if you will ever be given an item to test or review 
len ratingone It hasn t happened yet for me but they want me to rate their app 
len ratingone  Stop being unavailable th
len ratingfive The app is great from everything I ve seen but why do you need to be or older to use it 
len ratingone Needs to be able to auto update 
len ratingone It should also be simpler to onboard new users 
len ratingone Apple is way behind Google in beta testing
len ratingone Much like the rest of Apple s development ecosystem Testflight is plagued by poor interface slow updates and unexplained phenomenon 
len ratingone If you push a build out to your new testers you may find them waiting an hour or hours before they get the invite if they get it at all 
len ratingone Then they may have to be removed re added and uninstall then reinstall both your test build and this app itself 
len ratingone I strongly recommend bypassing Testflight as much as humanly possible 
len ratingone  Makes me accept the new terms frequently when starting it and much slower to refresh than it used to be
len ratingfive This app is amazing it helps u get famous just for being on a trend 
len ratingfive The only problem is that it picks only certain people I wish they could fix that otherwise 
len ratingfive  I have not been given any redeem codes as of yet however am looking forward to using the system
len ratingfive  I have received one Testing if an app
len ratingfive  very great app 
len ratingfive it s starting changed my life in first day use 
len ratingfour Please
len ratingfive So far easy to use basic set up an has all your apps right on the main page when you first open app 
len ratingtwo There s a bit of irony for you 
len ratingtwo Locks often particularly when trying to send feedback 
len ratingthree  With new release is ok 
len ratingthree But with old app release in Testflight is lost 
len ratingthree You can fix it pls
len ratingfive  This dope
len ratingfour Most of the time it works times I know I slept hours and recorded only 
len ratingfive There are no bells and whistles in the program but it does what it is designed to do quickly and simply 
len ratingone  On the App Store it says and up is allowed 
len ratingone When I launch the app it says and over 
len ratingone I m doing this for a game called rec room 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingone Downloaded this app from the Apple App Store and just like many other downloads of apps it is not useful and the app support is minimal to resolve issues reported 
len ratingone One pays for service and protection but only receive dissatisfaction and problems on top of problems with no support from App Developers Service Providers and Manufactures leaving the consumer to fend for themselves to obtain justice 
len ratingfive Greatest and easy to use file share and organizer and so much more 
len ratingfive In minutes you can learn and are up and running 
len ratingone I never receive the requisite code in the invitation email that allows me to do anything more than download the Test Flight App which I ve had for years with all the updates I d love to Beta Test Adobe s products but there s a disconnect somewhere in this routine 
len ratingfive  Qua t t
len ratingone Can t get invitation code
len ratingone So if this is then why do you have to be years old am like years old but you have to be joking
len ratingone How do I get an email for a code
len ratingone The thing doesn t let me put in certain codes it doesn t let me use certain words either
len ratingone No invitation
len ratingone huh 
len ratingfive  It s like when he s like uhhh I m not a good guy and I don t wanna see what I mean I wanna see you this is the one that I will be in the next three months and a lot of time to e
len ratingfive  This is the best app I have used for Sleep monitoring so far 
len ratingfive The heart rate feature literally saved my life 
len ratingfive It showed consistent high heart rate every day I was having other problems but did not connect until then 
len ratingfive I went to my Dr and after testing he found a blockage I had angioplasty and all is well 
len ratingfive This feature needs to remain 
len ratingthree Have to type it in manually
len ratingone It s not working 
len ratingone App is asking for code 
len ratingfive I m beta testing the new rec room mobile and it works perfectly 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Very good app so far 
len ratingfive keep up the good work 
len ratingfive  App is super useful
len ratingone Ok so I have this app on my phone and iPad to try to get it to work but it won t 
len ratingone I never got a code and neither did my friend and I would really like to have this work 
len ratingone Please help me to get this to work and send me a code 
len ratingfive Love using this Easy To Use Easy To Read calculator 
len ratingfive I have this app on both my iPad and iPhone as my Ready To Go To calculator 
len ratingfive The new app is great
len ratingtwo I m wanting to use this for Snapchat s beta but when I hit install it says I might loose the data 
len ratingtwo Has this happened for other people 
len ratingfive  It is amazing 
len ratingfour I like this Crowdtap app testpanel it works awesome 
len ratingfour It works a lot better then site 
len ratingfour When I answer questions it lets me select my answers 
len ratingfour On the site doesnt work to well 
len ratingthree Why does it keep saying beta is full then it say we enrolled you on the list wait while we keep things tight like how long because I been waiting 
len ratingfive Hey I really wanna try this app out but I can t seem to find the code or get another one thanks 
len ratingfive At first I was a little skeptical 
len ratingfive But these developers definitely know what they re doing 
len ratingtwo This app says can use it and my yr old daughter needs to use it but once I try to download it on her phone it says and under can t use it 
len ratingfive Supa Weenie is hilariously fun 
len ratingfive The visuals are engaging and bring a unique sense of humor 
len ratingfive It s an awesome challenge and it runs very smoothly 
len ratingfive So far I m the Supa Weenie champion in my household 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I couldn t stop playing 
len ratingfive It s a fun challenge while also being sentimental 
len ratingfive So excited about this 
len ratingfive  Testing
len ratingfive Finally the Netflix Facebook for podcasts 
len ratingfive Seriously 
len ratingfive Check it out 
len ratingfive It does everything except walk the dog 
len ratingfive After being invited through TikTok to try this app I read into it and I m super excited to try 
len ratingfive I ll update my review but so far stars for the idea 
len ratingfive Trying apps in their beta phase is great 
len ratingone How to get an snapchat redeem code 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingone  This is the best app ever omg Jenna u r so hot right now like omg
len ratingfive  Useful app
len ratingone I ave had this on my phone for quit some time and have yet to see anything 
len ratingone I m sure it a wonderful app 
len ratingone It I guess is just not a wonderful one for me because again it s a waste of space 
len ratingfive  I love everything about just fab 
len ratingone I am added but I cannot see any apps
len ratingfive Blew my socks off 
len ratingthree Gg
len ratingtwo Good when it works annoying when it takes its own time getting the beta app to me 
len ratingtwo For example right now I m waiting for an app to show up released a day ago and it just doesn t 
len ratingfive Add Dark them
len ratingfive I ve been testing the Low On app and love it 
len ratingfive It is easy to help me keep up with my shopping list at which store plus I can share it with my husband 
len ratingfive This way he can help out with the shopping 
len ratingfive It s been a big time saver 
len ratingthree  The keyboard in the app is not allowing me to put in numbers 
len ratingthree So how am I suppose to type in an invitation code 
len ratingfive  I love this app Credit Karma has helped me build my credit
len ratingone Why am I getting pop ups reminding me to leave a review on this app 
len ratingone I was in the middle of leaving feedback on an app when the pop up came 
len ratingone I couldn t click the pop up because my keyboard was in the way 
len ratingone Couldn t get back to my email either 
len ratingone Guess what happened to my long feedback email 
len ratingone Leaving a star for that exact reason 
len ratingone I can understand reminding me to leave feedback on apps im testing but not the app I used to test the apps 
len ratingone That s ridiculous 
len ratingfive One of the few message apps you can enjoy privacy 
len ratingfive App is easy to use 
len ratingfive Clear instructions 
len ratingfive Immediate results 
len ratingfive Would definitely recommend 
len ratingone This app says when you get in the game it says you have to be DONT GET THIS IF YOUR UNDER 
len ratingfive Honestly I just would like to stop a second and thank TestFlight for the opportunity to be a public tester 
len ratingfive It is a great honor to be a part of your team 
len ratingfive Using different strategies than Angry Birds Friends 
len ratingfive Enjoy having the option of using all power ups 
len ratingthree This latest update for JustFab has caused the app to stop working timeout 
len ratingthree Pleaser look into this and correct ASAP 
len ratingthree Thanks 
len ratingone Ii need a redeem code 
len ratingone I can t even open the program
len ratingthree Hey Apple When emailing a developer from within TestFlight why doesn t the email form remember the address that we used previously as the sender 
len ratingthree Mail app does this as soon as we enter a recipient s address Mail automatically changes the sender address to the one we always use for that recipient 
len ratingthree You ve already addressed no pun intended this issue in Mail 
len ratingthree Why can t the mail form in TestFlight do the same 
len ratingthree The fact that it doesn t makes it far too easy in TestFlight to accidentally email a developer from the wrong address 
len ratingone  I 
len ratingone Red a redeem code 
len ratingone I can t even open the program
len ratingfive  Bitam
len ratingthree There is no reason to have the top left redeem button when you have an app in beta with nothing to redeem 
len ratingthree This button should not even be here 
len ratingthree TestFlight has to have many more features added and work better with App Store Connect 
len ratingthree Technically these apps should be merged into and only developers get more access when they sign into their Apple Developer Account 
len ratingfive I value you this app and its technological abilities with the combining elements of art and augmented reality 
len ratingfive I m just appreciative to it and I just continue wanting to work with this material and show works I have done I m expanding my craft and love for tech to think different 
len ratingfive Me
len ratingone  Every time I start it it gives me the welcome to test flight screen 
len ratingone Then it just sits there and spins 
len ratingone Most of the time it doesn t display my list of apps 
len ratingone Everyone once in a while it will but I have to wait maybe minutes and keep my screen alive 
len ratingone I have to uninstall and reinstall to get the list to display again 
len ratingone I have gotten notifications that there is an app update I click on it and it just says open 
len ratingone There isn t an update 
len ratingfour  I love this game so much 
len ratingfour It s fun and amazing with some what balance in it 
len ratingfour Only thing is that there are way too many Afk in matches 
len ratingfour I hope that the punishments for Afk would be much harsher so then Afk would exist no more 
len ratingfour People get discouraged after first few deaths even first blood 
len ratingfour Also sometime it is a bit laggy 
len ratingfour I haven t had much experience with it but when it lags it goes hard 
len ratingfour Lag spikes are crazy shoots up to ms 
len ratingfour But it s over all a good game in its Beta stage 
len ratingfive Love testing new apps
len ratingfive Best app ever 
len ratingfive I can t believe it 
len ratingone  Jjd
len ratingthree  I haven t seen the app too soon to rate it
len ratingfive Great App 
len ratingfive Finally all Jooish News in one organized place 
len ratingfive This is what everyone has been waiting anxiously for 
len ratingone LXCBDTNB
len ratingfive  Goat for this thx my aim is trash hopefully it helps 
len ratingone i dont know how to get the invitation code just say No app available to test and i dont know where or how to do it
len ratingone Rfhruefvhurfehrfuvhrdwuuchferruiornerfiofrejorrferref
len ratingfive I was happy to see how easy it is to use 
len ratingfive The notifications make it easy and I won t miss anything
len ratingone Really terrible 
len ratingone Nightmare 
len ratingfour Good
len ratingtwo Sleep aid doesn t work right and no way to send beta feedback in app 
len ratingtwo Uninstalled
len ratingone When I opened TestFlight it said the new version is required 
len ratingone After update it still says the same error 
len ratingone Its already updated but does not run 
len ratingone Not expected from Apple 
len ratingthree  Not exactly sure how much I enjoy this being that it s using IE to track my workouts 
len ratingthree It seems to get the times I actually workout out of the rest of the time it s picking up random times that I need to adjust 
len ratingthree Not really sure of the concept of it and if at any point it will show my status of what I ve actually done and burned and other information 
len ratingthree Right now it s just asking me if I ve been to the gym and the times 
len ratingfive Wow 
len ratingfive It only takes time 
len ratingfive Follow along with the app give it time 
len ratingfive You ll get there 
len ratingfive TestFlight was essential to being able to test my first app 
len ratingfive It was so easy to get my beta in the hands of other people for feedback
len ratingfive Text is HUGE after latest update using larger text in accessibility but still humongous 
len ratingfive Good game
len ratingfive  Epic
len ratingtwo App will not install on my iPhone 
len ratingfive I hate this app
len ratingfive  Best app on iTunes right now 
len ratingfive Updated to the newest relaxed melodies now it won t open
len ratingfive  This is the only sleep app that i rely on everyday to wake me up for work 
len ratingfive I recommend it to everyone 
len ratingfive Its user friendly and analyzes your sleep
len ratingtwo I can t get in my phone is plus
len ratingfive Ok
len ratingfive Great concept 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingthree The admin tools are not intuitive 
len ratingthree Bulk adding user management and group management don t always support basic use cases 
len ratingthree We also found that a variable lag time between uploading a new build to test fight and users being able to download the build 
len ratingthree Only sometimes did users receive push notifications about new builds 
len ratingone App developers ask us to help them with their apps and then force us to sign a release absolving them of all liability for damages they may cause 
len ratingone I m done with overly broad releases 
len ratingone I deleted this app 
len ratingfive Fun way to get to know people 
len ratingfour Great
len ratingfive Edge works great on ipad 
len ratingfive Performance is as good as Safari appearance is cleaner shares bookmarks with Edge on Windows PC 
len ratingfive  So usefull
len ratingfive This app is fabulous 
len ratingfive It assures me that I m getting the best price for each item 
len ratingfive I pick what I want and Popcart does the rest 
len ratingfive Wouldn t be with it 
len ratingfive Probably one of my most appreciated apps 
len ratingfive  This is nice for ios testing beta s
len ratingone Not getting email verification in a timely manner
len ratingfive The innovative methods in ACCOMPLISH READING help readers activate fix up strategies in order to better understand the meaning of paragraphs 
len ratingfive Very good
len ratingfive Outstanding concept and overall app design 
len ratingfive Looking forward to live release 
len ratingfive  Finally someone came out wit a app that combines notes a calculator and phones all in one and you and edit the photos to add words and symbols 
len ratingfive Great for estimating repairs or an construction work 
len ratingfive What a pain it use to be going from notes to put in measurements then out of the app to go to calculator then back and forth times to add everything up 
len ratingfive Also the picture function is great I can write on the pictures of each room im estimating A 
len ratingthree Jumping through the Freefly hoops because I have no other choice 
len ratingone The keyboard is not allowing me to use the letters U I O A M and L on TestFlight so I cannot redeem a beta code 
len ratingone Please fix this 
len ratingfive  Great
len ratingfive Thanks Apple for this utility 
len ratingfive One recommendation I have for this is to enable the Apple feedback app to also communicate with developers for apps which are in TestFlight 
len ratingfive  Rapchat gets a star all the way they support and help my career a lot would love to thank Rapchat for everything 
len ratingone I wanted to beta test a game 
len ratingone I got an invite from the game 
len ratingone I downloaded test flight and went back to the game to download the beta version 
len ratingone I repeatedly get an error message to try again later 
len ratingone No apps to test and I ve reloaded it several times
len ratingone Try townships Beta Decided to go back to the normal Township and it starts me all the way back to level one
len ratingone  Nothing was there after I download it 
len ratingone Don t know what to do now
len ratingfour I love playing this game I feel that it could be better if you went back to the old zoo though 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive Really think this is a brilliant idea 
len ratingfive Can t wait to use it more 
len ratingfive Not everybody has family and friends with same interests this will make it easy to find people with similar interests to enjoy specific activities 
len ratingfive Liiiike
len ratingfive  Voy a checar esta app a ver qu tal esta 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I can find staffing in of the time than I used to 
len ratingfive Amazing 
len ratingfive  Superrrr
len ratingfive The meditation program is wonderful 
len ratingfive I use it daily to relax when stressed and love the controlled breathing program 
len ratingone No instructions on how to use
len ratingone I never got an invitation code 
len ratingthree  plz remove persistent orange dot from app 
len ratingthree tnx
len ratingone Get off my phone 
len ratingfive  Muy buena app
len ratingfive  I ve been watching XO for years and the memes are just as spicy 
len ratingfive If a developer of this app is reading this can you respond back letting me know how do I add beta tester codes or public links to this app 
len ratingfive I ll star TestFlight app ratings if you re helpful 
len ratingone App prompting for review right after install it 
len ratingone Very very frustrating 
len ratingfive Very user friendly and convenient to use 
len ratingfive Bravo 
len ratingone Tasks will not load and I followed your instructions to delete and reload app 
len ratingone Now I have lost all my data went from level to level not happy with beta 
len ratingone Annoying
len ratingone Not sure why it asked me to be a beta tester because I did not get an email or anything regarding Township app
len ratingone This is not Business Class call quality 
len ratingone The biggest issue is you cannot get a clear call 
len ratingone Period 
len ratingone Not thing else matters without this
len ratingone Send the password
len ratingfive This is awesome
len ratingtwo I Just wanted to play OSU 
len ratingtwo Lazer
len ratingthree So you see that it says on the age rating 
len ratingthree You think you can go on it right 
len ratingthree So you take time out of your day to download it only to find out you have to be 
len ratingthree This is infuriating 
len ratingthree Why give it a rating if a lot of the percentage of Apple can t use it when the rating says they can 
len ratingthree What makes this app so bad that you have to make it 
len ratingfive This is a super handy app 
len ratingfive I have waisted many hours looking for keys and wondering what a key is for is 
len ratingfive Sending someone to a property with the correct key rather than a large bunch is very useful 
len ratingfive I wish I had this years ago 
len ratingone There is never any apps to try 
len ratingfive Buena
len ratingfive Test flight is the best app for the newest releases and offers it is a great way for you to voice your opinions on a variety of applications 
len ratingfive While giving you a way to voice and suggest to many of the apps you use on a daily basis how to improve from their current versions
len ratingfive This is awesome 
len ratingfive I like the continuous improvement for this project
len ratingfive Wail
len ratingone I got no invitation code and can t move forward
len ratingone I never received the invite and had to create a new appleID for work in order to get the invite 
len ratingone The whole process is awkward 
len ratingtwo  Today TestFlight just stopped working 
len ratingtwo No longer can connect 
len ratingtwo No explanation no warning 
len ratingtwo Nothing from the app developers 
len ratingtwo Nada 
len ratingtwo Useless 
len ratingone Why it is periodically not working 
len ratingone Am getting TestFlight unavailability error 
len ratingone Is there a way to resolve
len ratingfive What a great bag reminder app 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive I m inquiring about the TestFlight beta and I would like to participate if you have room for me to join 
len ratingfive Sincerely Christia Costello
len ratingfive The UI is very intuitive 
len ratingfive The progress of the initial idea to where it ends up is surprisingly good and sometimes just surprising 
len ratingfive lol
len ratingfive sMDaepi
len ratingfive Excellente appli ouafa mkou
len ratingfive Never thought much of keeping track of things I ve done 
len ratingfive This app has become a daily reminder of what I ve done but more importantly when the last time and this turns into motivation 
len ratingfive For instance snow skiing 
len ratingfive Each day I see its been week weeks then longer until the reminder turns into motivation to plan the next trip 
len ratingfive Working out is same thing 
len ratingfive If I see it s been two or three days or longer it gets my butt into the gym 
len ratingfive When was last time I took wife out on date 
len ratingfive When was last time I got a haircut 
len ratingfive Saw a friend 
len ratingfive And on and on Of the dozens of apps I have on my phone this one stays first page always 
len ratingthree This is one of the best apps i have ever found but my little brother gets really mad because he cant use this app because you allegedly need to be over Why is that 
len ratingfive Very decent app links me to the community of university friends 
len ratingfive This is a great way to help developers create great apps 
len ratingone  Hit a wall 
len ratingone Couldn t get into site 
len ratingfive  TestFlight sheds light on a whole new world of variety and uniqueness based on the horizon of new age development 
len ratingfive Definitely worth the download and the experience of Beta testing 
len ratingfive  Hello
len ratingone Apple Watch apps fail to install due to a bug in this app 
len ratingfive Excited to be a part of this new venture to train us all to maintain a healthier lifestyle from the start 
len ratingone Loaded fine but will not open app I am trying to test asks for certificate
len ratingone There s a lack of information on how to actually download the test app content 
len ratingfive What can I say this is great 
len ratingfive  I was honored to have been one of the first to get to test this out before it went to market 
len ratingfive It was an extremely scaled down version than what it is now 
len ratingfive Even then I was excited about it 
len ratingfive Now it s a must have for any blind or visually impaired person who wants to increase their independence within a metropolitan area 
len ratingone Trying to get in to test Habits of Heath 
len ratingone I can t even get in 
len ratingone Don t receive the emails 
len ratingone My test device does not have email 
len ratingone So manually getting started is a pain using another device 
len ratingone Developer sends and resends invite but no success 
len ratingone Don t understand why the invite is not present immediately when I open TestFlight 
len ratingone I was able to download the MESSENGER TESTFLIGHT but when I go to redeem it it requires a code which was suppose to sent to me prior to my ABILITY to download the TESTFLIGHT 
len ratingone SO who has my code because I sure never got it 
len ratingtwo Miss orders with no alarm
len ratingone Needs to be fixed 
len ratingfive  This is great for women like me who need to really understand that the party on other side is genuine 
len ratingfive Thanks for this app 
len ratingone I watched a video that supposedly told you how to use Testflight to add MovieBoxPro to your Apple tv but it works nothing like they say it does 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive I love everything about Notability 
len ratingfive I just wish it could have something like tabs on Safari 
len ratingfive It s the most used productivity on my iPad 
len ratingfive I ve never been able to meditate because I didn t know how to focus 
len ratingfive This guided meditation has solved that problem 
len ratingfive I really like this app I have used it almost every day since I started 
len ratingfive Thanks Kathleen Gomez
len ratingfour The volume control is not very sensitive either too soft or too loud 
len ratingfour I have had to repurchase the app numerous times
len ratingfive  The developers are great 
len ratingfive They communicate and are so sweet 
len ratingfive I can tell this complaint is amazing and the people are great along with the addicting game 
len ratingfive The game is so convenient it s quick fun games on the go

len ratingone So far nothing new too test
len ratingone Because you can t even go back how do you go back
len ratingfive  Amazing 
len ratingfive Sugoi 
len ratingone  It wouldn t even allow me to do anything at all
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive Was looking for a simple app for lists and this is it 
len ratingfive No gimmicks super user friendly 
len ratingfive Has all of the tools I ve needed sharing pictures organizing tools etc 
len ratingfive without unnecessary complications 
len ratingfive  This tastes like raspberries and it tastes good 
len ratingfive As raspberries do 
len ratingfive Great way to test new apps 
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfive Haloha makes you stop think amp write about where you are in the moment in your day in your life by answering thought provoking questions which connect you to others who also write and send their answers in circle color feelings amp messages

len ratingone This is a pretty bad bug 
len ratingfive This is the best mobility app on the market 
len ratingone I just downloaded the app

len ratingfour You guys should add an option to scan a QR code to redeem invitation code
len ratingfive Starting testing from now on
len ratingfive  Tu
len ratingfive Well designed easy to use app 
len ratingfive How can I get an invitation code for TestFlight 
len ratingfive Have been using this app for a while and find it useful to understand hour by hour current flows 
len ratingfive Love this app and it s improvements just wish the men were friendly
len ratingfour  I would prefer if updates launched automatically vs needing to go into the app to do so
len ratingfive nnnn
len ratingone  I m not old enough to use it But I m a developer Why 
len ratingone Ps developer on sololearn 
len ratingone But Anyway Apple I ve heard rumors about iOS having dark mode First of all Is it true Second of all will it support iPod touch th generation GB Pss I m a tech geek

len ratingfive Test Flight always works as expected 
len ratingfive Never a crash or delayed delivery of the beta apps

len ratingfive The app is amazing 
len ratingfive I can write stories I am interested in and express my ideas I will keep it 
len ratingone Why do I have to have a code and I used my old email and never got any codes I downloaded this years ago and still nothing
len ratingfive Its nice to have something that helps you find an app and able to test its beta out for you 
len ratingfive Very cool idea 
len ratingfive Im enjoying this app 
len ratingone I followed all the directions downloaded the app and now it says I need a code but there was no code given 
len ratingone This is one of my frustrations with these testing apps 
len ratingfive I need a code for then I can start it so if anyone has the code thxs

len ratingfive I love testing apps before most other people makes it so much more better 
len ratingone Can t get it to open

len ratingthree I just did the latest update today and now messenger will not stay open 
len ratingthree As soon as I open it within seconds it closes 
len ratingthree What do I need to do 
len ratingfive Awsome
len ratingfive Perfect
len ratingone What is the game called 
len ratingfive This is One of the best ways for developers to enhance their apps and for gamers to test out the games 
len ratingone It won t let me put in my email again cause I pressed the wrong button and now I can t put my email smh
len ratingfive  it is awesome background color slowly dim depends on enemy attack mode gravitational influence is quite spectacle in terms of defense mode proximity effect is impressive when enemy approach the infinite wave platform 
len ratingfive  I use SongSheet EVERYDAY as I m constantly working on my music and playlists for my gigs 
len ratingfive I ve been performing for years and when I found SongSheet it was a game changer for me 
len ratingfive I have many playlists for the different places I go and perform and the app works like a dream every time I use it 
len ratingfive I work on music while I m traveling as my iPad and this app go everywhere with me

len ratingfive Thank you so much for creating this app 
len ratingone Really confusing flow
len ratingfive Clean and simple
len ratingfive Umm tik tok sent me and I need an invitation please
len ratingfive It litty titty
len ratingfive This seems to work exceedingly well 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive  Once again That Game Company weaves a tapestry of images and sound into a captivating and engaging experience 
len ratingfive To assign the word game truly does a disservice 
len ratingfive Checkers is a game this is a sojourn into one s dreams and perhaps even to that part of ourselves we wished could exist out in the everyday world 
len ratingfive Like Journey you find yourself amidst the background of awe inspiring images and landscapes that are in essence like a character in itself 
len ratingfive Without disclosing anything more I will say I was engrossed from the first moments and the experience is one that remains long after you ve paused your visit and joined the world of the mundane 
len ratingfive I like to test apps but can you please send or text me a code 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive This might be the best app ever created 
len ratingfive  stars
len ratingfive Great app to organize my household 
len ratingfive  It is working out great for me

len ratingfive  Nice and clean 
len ratingfive Easy to use and I like the security features 
len ratingfive  It s Awesome congrats Regards Taslim JFK Ambassador 
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingthree After logging into TestFlight with one account your unable to switch accounts even uninstall reinstall doesn t work 
len ratingfive This app is very easy to use 
len ratingfive Just opened it and started exploring 
len ratingfive It doesn t have all the parks yet but more are added regularly 
len ratingfive It took me a bit to figure out how to load offline maps but once I did they worked great even in airplane mode 
len ratingfive Can t wait to try it on a Great Smokeys hike 
len ratingfive Great and useful for everything keeping in touch with friends and family and loved ones 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingfive Helps me appear much more organized with my clients saves time and money 
len ratingone I installed in my iPhone but all the app does is ask for a redeem code 
len ratingone I haven t received a email asking me to confirm the app either 
len ratingone Hopefully this is resolved as I d like to see how well this platform works
len ratingfive I love the concept of this app 
len ratingfive You can literally win a contest and be able to win a rewards 
len ratingfive I use the app daily because it s the easiest way to access Ray s principles as well as my own 
len ratingfive It has become a habit for me to use the app in many day to day situations as a means of reflection and of strategy 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingone I signed up and have never received an app to trial 
len ratingone Thus a waste of available space on the device 
len ratingfive J aime trop cet trop cool
len ratingtwo When do I start that
len ratingfive  An honor to test Cortana for i because she has been down with me and The Chief since The Covenant we re first seen
len ratingone Why is this app available if there is nothing to test 
len ratingone I wanted to get Retail Box in order to rub the Apple screen savers that are not available but this app does nothing 
len ratingone I am very disappointed 
len ratingfive This is so simple
len ratingfive I love you BandLab
len ratingfive  Great had it for a long time now and I like it 
len ratingfive  Best app ever
len ratingfive  Shout out to the guys behind this app it s great to have for personal notes and sharing information 
len ratingfive Simple to use and a huge time saver 
len ratingthree I turned off email notifications for all the apps I have in TestFlight but I still get email notifications 
len ratingthree The idea of the app is great but the settings don t work 
len ratingone I need to login with a particular work account 
len ratingone Yet again Apple makes an app TOO simple by preventing me from logging into a particular account 
len ratingone I didn t get my redeem code in my email
len ratingfive  So TikTok asked me to beta test a new update and I don t know if it s real 
len ratingone I was ask by a company I use Square to try their Beta program but it didn t show a cost when I downloaded it 
len ratingone Then after it said I was charged 
len ratingone I don t appreciate this 
len ratingone It doesn t even say how much or if it is a recurring fee 
len ratingone  It takes literally a minute to load the list of apps I am testing 
len ratingone Just a white screen and a spinning indicator 
len ratingfive  What a fun app and super easy to use 
len ratingfive This fit perfectly into my lifestyle and look forward to watching the progression over time 
len ratingfive Would definitely recommend to friends and family 
len ratingfive  Love it 
len ratingfive I think this will be the new wave giant of apps and outdo Facebook Snapchat and instagram 
len ratingfive Guys I love this app
len ratingone  Nothing to see 
len ratingone  No sirve
len ratingfive  Awesome seamless setup that took only seconds to have the new beta app installed 
len ratingone Codes Can t be reused when changing phones if u lost the the first phone that redeemed
len ratingone There is nothing to test 
len ratingone I got all excited for nothing and it is really annoying and stupid
len ratingfive Extremely fun to play 
len ratingthree Hey TestFlight I never got a code to join the Beta club can you send me a invite please if you can t I understand thank you 
len ratingone No redemption code sent to my email each time i hit test now app will open i hit accept and it loops back to the steps again
len ratingone  No code
len ratingtwo I release Apps for testing between AM and PM Central Standard Time 
len ratingtwo Apple sends notifications and an email to all testers between AM and AM 
len ratingtwo It happens to multiple testers and they are complaining 
len ratingtwo It is very annoying 
len ratingtwo Please fix TestFlight so the App available notifications and emails are sent within a few minutes of when the TestFlight Apps are actually released for testing 
len ratingone Did everything it said do in Snapchat and still no invitation code 
len ratingone Can t try something if you can t use it 
len ratingone  Still waitin
len ratingone this beta isnt accepting new testers right now 
len ratingfive  How do I get a invitation code for my TestFlight app
len ratingfive  Ok m
len ratingfive User friendly faster better smarter more to follow 
len ratingone No Apps to test even though I am following my company s instructions to test an app 
len ratingone Frustrating 
len ratingfour  It s a good app I enjoy it but at times the ads do have some glitches 
len ratingone There s never anything here to test 
len ratingfive  Amazing app highly recommend everyone should download 
len ratingone  Say it all
len ratingfive  Absolutely amazing technology
len ratingone  It is very sad how i apple wont let me do an airplane physics game on this but let me play Fortnite
len ratingfive I ve used this app for EchoLink to find problems with software connections from one end of the spectrum to the other 
len ratingfive Work flawlessly and gives to views of coding and to isolate problems 
len ratingfive Not much interaction except when an updated version is released 
len ratingfive This one has about one per week 
len ratingone Wanted to love the owlet and being a beta but I hate everything about it 
len ratingone I cannot get many features to work I can t get push notifications on my phone and I need to download a new app every days and now the most recent on I was just emailed says it will only last for days 
len ratingfive How to get a verification code
len ratingone Does not work at all 
len ratingone It just keeps telling me TestFlight is currently unavailable or Failed to Load App I ve deleted reinstalled and updated multiple times 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive Wonderful technology 
len ratingfive Is a good opportunity for consumers Makes it possible to share opinions with game developers
len ratingone The app stops entering the permission code on the third letter 
len ratingone I cannot have access and the is no help info or who to contact for tech support 
len ratingone I didn t feel as if you released a valuable contribution to my team building accommodations 
len ratingfive  Hope enjoy new app and win
len ratingfive Excelente
len ratingfour  I ve had the app before but could never get in I never received a code how do I get said code 
len ratingfive What s the redeem code 
len ratingfive Fire
len ratingone Get always Can t connect to the server and build is no longer available even just after getting the invitation 
len ratingfive  I love it
len ratingfive Ability for clients to test the mock up and apps 
len ratingfour  very nice app
len ratingfive  Dope app you won t be disappointed
len ratingone Abelllll
len ratingone  I don t know how can I receive the invitation code 
len ratingone I this this good app but need more fix
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive  Can I please get an invitation to join the beta
len ratingfour I love the animation
len ratingfive  Yesss 
len ratingfour I like this approach more than the book approach 
len ratingfour It seems a lot quicker to use 
len ratingfive  I m going to looooove using this app 
len ratingfour Can you please send me a code 
len ratingfive  This is the way to get everyone involved in creating or helping to create better apps for everyone
len ratingfive  This is honest a really cool opportunity you guys are doin quick way to make so extra cash too 
len ratingone It s really not possible to add notes before I upload the build 
len ratingone I have to go to the website and fill in the details and I have no clue how long it will take for processing 
len ratingone It would be good if we can add test notes from the testflight app after it has processed 
len ratingone It would be great if we can add notes before uploading 
len ratingfive Keep it coming 
len ratingfive I m really enjoying this app and it works for the blind and physical Lee impaired people 
len ratingfive Optional
len ratingfive I m enjoying this app 
len ratingfive I m hoping to use it for my business but first I will watch and learn
len ratingfive Simple and easy to use 
len ratingfive I can t wait to get a notification that a new beta is available 
len ratingfive This app has been indispensable for testing our apps 
len ratingthree  Bdjdjf
len ratingfour Very easy just convenient 
len ratingone It is impossible to know how TestFlight is connected to various apple ids 
len ratingone Horrible UI and UX 
len ratingone I dread using it 
len ratingone I did not get a invitation email and I tried deleting it to just see if I could try again and it didn t work
len ratingfive  Easy to install went right to the app I m trying to test 
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive Stay tuned 
len ratingfive Thanks
len ratingone Received a public link to install a beta app 
len ratingone Had to install TestFlight first ok no problem 
len ratingone Once it s installed it tells me I have no apps to install and need to Redeem a code but there is no code 
len ratingone Had to quit and restart TestFlight and then go back and find initial public link before TestFlight woke up to realize that I do have an app to install 
len ratingone Might expect this from rd party products but very poor flow and continuity from a process of entirely Apple controlled components 
len ratingfive Many different interesting talk shows as well as music 
len ratingfive I enjoy listening to stuff going on around the word 
len ratingfour Why does apple make you get a whole other app to download beta testing apps 
len ratingfour Google does fine with just the one play store 
len ratingfive  Good app
len ratingfive  good app
len ratingone I don t have a code to get in and I don t know where to get it
len ratingfive I love the ease of the app for testing beta versions of some of your favorite apps 
len ratingfive Install participant provide feedback it s that easy 
len ratingfive I only wish you could go to a site to see what opportunities are out there for testing 
len ratingone Highly annoying
len ratingone Hi
len ratingfive Just works 
len ratingfive This is the best app for a owner operator
len ratingfive Perfect for testing my own apps and gets insights from others 
len ratingfour Like the simple straight forward approach but this really needs the ability to have structured input specified by the developer 
len ratingfour Apple Radar Bug reporting while perhaps the most frustrating service Apple provides has a reasonably decent web tool for collecting bug report information in a semi structured way 
len ratingfour This tool not the service oh H no needs to be extended to a real app interface and provided as part of test flight 
len ratingfour The system report in the bug report is nice but the unformatted email reports are a cumbersome undisciplined approach that needs to be addressed 
len ratingfour Bear in mind this app is not in any way free as it costs developers of their app revenue to publish apps for the iOS market 
len ratingfour At that price it is reasonable to expect more from the app 
len ratingone No me llego ning n c digo y no tengo mucha idea de lo que tengo que hacer para poder acceder a la aplicaci n 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive Easy to use great
len ratingfive My WiFi Not Yours Poolgate
len ratingfive This app does its job and is pretty easy to use
len ratingfour Definitely getting better with this app would like to see the desktop version for pc s Also would like to have the option of manually select the which workouts you choose send to Strava
len ratingfive  Thank u for helping me get Beta for Highrise your the best 
len ratingfive I like that I can get the beta version of my apps 
len ratingone This app will not even open 
len ratingone I emailed support several times and have never received a reply 
len ratingone I do not see an invitation code in instructions after dL app 
len ratingfive  Evident the team behind this are quality 
len ratingfive This app is fantastic 
len ratingfive Previously I was using an Android tablet than got slower and slower in responding to my choices 
len ratingfive I am very pleased with Newzik and especially the support that I have received from the developer 
len ratingfive I highly recommend Newzik 
len ratingfive You ll not be disappointed 
len ratingfive WDW Beta Tester
len ratingfive The ability to organize photos on the phone and it is so easy to do 
len ratingfive I really like this app 
len ratingfive This is one to share with Family and Friends 
len ratingfive Still don t know how to get a link or code to use in the redeem code
len ratingfive Very easy to use 
len ratingfour So I downloaded this app because I had no idea what it was 
len ratingfour So a few months later and I notice this beta test area on Snapchat

len ratingfive It s a good app
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive Ceviche Hi just got rcchyvrcgr

len ratingfive Super fun game 
len ratingfive Couldn t stop playing 
len ratingone I m always getting emails stating that I have a beta test to check through test flight 
len ratingone When I try to access it I get that it can t be accessed 
len ratingone If I could give this a zero I would 
len ratingfive Nice UI and easy to use
len ratingfive Enjoy finding different gifs to express what I want to say 
len ratingone I don t know where to find any beta apps for testing 
len ratingone I will give better rating after I find something I can test out
len ratingthree Asks for a review before you ve installed a single app or done anything at all with it yet
len ratingfive  Just got this app and it s amazing 
len ratingfive Love the content and all it has to offer 
len ratingfive Definitely would recommend
len ratingfive  Mar am
len ratingfive Keep going 
len ratingfive The activities categories are easier to find 
len ratingfive Can now see the charge amount for a particular activity and immediately after entering the time entry 
len ratingfive  THE best
len ratingfour There s no option to delete recent calls
len ratingfive  We made this app for you 
len ratingfive To make you better in Jiu Jitsu for the love of our art 
len ratingfive So nice to have such easy access to what s important to me 
len ratingfive Great and comprehensive service 
len ratingone I downloaded this app to get retailbox but when I open TestFlight it says that the beta is full plz help

len ratingone Just make it go away 
len ratingfive Quick easy way to check next few days weather 
len ratingfive Easy to us with great user interface 
len ratingfour Paper work is hard to follow on instructions 
len ratingfour I do like the small device 
len ratingthree Feb It s telling me that I have no apps available to test 
len ratingthree I switched my rating to stars from because it might be something I am doing wrong or the app I am trying to test 
len ratingthree I will update again
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfour This app is amazing I use it every day 
len ratingfour Although on Android you can set times for your classes you can t set times like on iOS 
len ratingfour It only goes up in s and not by s 
len ratingfour This seems like a very easy fix and one that I need before I and other students can fully use the app on iOS 
len ratingfour Please fix soon 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive  So far so good
len ratingfive It s just as easy to install things on the AppStore but you need to get an invite code to download any beta apps 
len ratingfive I have been using test flight since last week 
len ratingfive I love the added station Country pop classics 
len ratingfive I have not yet used video will test today
len ratingone App is always slow to open and there s always a loading icon in the center of the screen 
len ratingone Frequently an error shows that it can t load 
len ratingone Doesn t seem like a quality Apple app at all and it makes it hard to beta test apps 
len ratingfive  Please give me the code 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive good
len ratingthree Receiving notifications that a new test flight version of the app I m testing is available but it does not show up in test flight 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It s amazing to watch your money grow in nano seconds 
len ratingfive Better than any game 
len ratingfour Just needs to show in color Blm and forest service land when the claims come up but miners need this program for research thank you for making this app
len ratingfive The app works very fine so far i have no complaints keep the hard work 
len ratingtwo Its asks for the review too many times which is really unusual and annoying
len ratingfour  Other than you can add multiple different pay rates for the same hour week it s a good app so far 
len ratingfive I wanted to use this application and I didn t receive any Test code thing in my Email someone help please 
len ratingfive Is there a resend option 
len ratingfive This game has so many different aspects to it 
len ratingfive You have a lot of exploring to do but it s a good mix of old school and new school favorites that keep you hooked

len ratingtwo Why is it age rated why do you have to be to test beta apps make a update so people of all ages can use it ps it puts a virus on your device

len ratingfive App was easy to download and easy to test 
len ratingfive High recommend it 
len ratingfive So far so good works almost the same on phone Can t delete trim marks though like usual 
len ratingfour Needs a better feedback system that maybe could provide developer defined fields to get info from the user 
len ratingfive Downloaded the app but have no idea what my email address is or what to do with the app 
len ratingfive Hopefully I ll be able to figure it out 
len ratingfive I just happen to see something that asked for my test flight email but I have more reading to do to see if it tells me more about it

len ratingone The app does absolutely nothing 
len ratingone Then it asks for me to write a review 
len ratingone Not so good so far 
len ratingone I ll update this if the app does something in the future 
len ratingfive Excellent app
len ratingfive Nice work 
len ratingfive  The best ever
len ratingfive Wow what a great idea an app that allows you to look at hay in your area or around the country 
len ratingfive Someone was really thinking when they put the app together 
len ratingfive Just like Amazon you can click and buy hay 
len ratingfive Thank you Haymap
len ratingone TestFlight is impacting team performance with day review process 
len ratingone This is silly and wrong 
len ratingone Apple should fix the beta review process 
len ratingone It should be no more than an hour to approve a beta build 
len ratingone Heck they get real App Store builds approved faster 
len ratingone Or maybe this is where the time went 
len ratingone Open app Are you enjoying testflight 
len ratingone Install beta are you enjoying testflight 
len ratingfive TES is the missing link 
len ratingfive The evaluation tool is quick easy and super informative 
len ratingfive  Double blind data is very cool 
len ratingfive Messaging and media wall are really helpful 
len ratingfive Finally an App that provides Value and Answers in a space with so many unanswered questions 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingone Invitation code pls
len ratingtwo  Why is it age rated why do you have to be to test beta apps make a update so people of all ages can use it
len ratingone I received an invite to test it was a pop up in Messenger and when I went to download the App the invite went away no way to retrieve it 
len ratingone Now I have a useless app 
len ratingfive  This app is my favorite dating app
len ratingfive I love this App 
len ratingfive What an awesome app this is 
len ratingfive I like the improvements connections are much better 
len ratingfive We did have the game freeze a few times but overall it s a much stronger connection 
len ratingone It s very slow 
len ratingone Causing frustration and annoyance 
len ratingone st attempt was last night and it was confusing and difficult 
len ratingone Not a positive experience 
len ratingone I ve returned this morning the nightmare continues 
len ratingone My feedback is among many but nonetheless what I ve experienced 
len ratingone I m sure it will improve 
len ratingone Good luck 
len ratingfive  Cool
len ratingone It won t send me code to get into app
len ratingfour  What s the difference I still don t have the updated messenger
len ratingfive  I m very involved in experimental technology can t wait to see what y all come up with 
len ratingfive Super fun slots and casino games 
len ratingfive Highly addictive 
len ratingfive Recommend
len ratingone The TestFlight app has constant popups asking me to review it 
len ratingone I am giving this star review so the popups will go away 
len ratingfive  Best slot games
len ratingone Nothing starts downloading 
len ratingone Just says waiting
len ratingfive  I love the game but it would be nice if you could do something else with your command points if you already upgraded all your guys to a new level but besides that I love the game and would love to see more games like this game my sister likes it to but she s more into dolls and stuff like that it is a great game and a fun way to fight kids should all play this game
len ratingfive  Cool works well
len ratingfive  This game is everything I love about an app 
len ratingfive Fun addictive and challenging in all the best ways 
len ratingfive Would highly recommend to all of my friends and family 
len ratingone Why cant we just upload release notes with build 
len ratingone Why do we have to wait for it to get processed 
len ratingone I tried opening the application and it would not let me do anything with it 
len ratingone I ve never once seen an app to test
len ratingfive The ease of updating has been dramatically improved 
len ratingfive Wonderful product 
len ratingfive Great testing program out there 
len ratingfive After waking up from background 
len ratingfive Please fix this 
len ratingfive Love this app makes navigating between gym and home workouts a breeze 
len ratingfive Love how the app keeps me on track and the layout is great for the exercises as well as the recipes 
len ratingfive Love it so far 
len ratingone It s telling me that I have to have a new phone and new number before I can use test flight and signal to secure my device 
len ratingfive Tank returns as the best fuel tracking app for Cirrus pilots 
len ratingfive Simply input the gallons used when you switch tanks and the app does the rest 
len ratingfive A must have for the Cirrus pilot 
len ratingone Not even letting me use snapchat beta because its full 
len ratingfive  Testing so far 
len ratingone Can t get download promised for weeks 
len ratingone Still not working 
len ratingone And now can t send reviews as my name and all others are taken Xperience sucky software
len ratingfive  Awesome 
len ratingfive Simple important 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingone Was told by Blink to use this app for Beta testing and they did not supply the Redeem code to apply to the TestFlight app 
len ratingone As a result I cannot install the testing products 
len ratingfive  Muy bueno
len ratingfive So far so good seems to work great just don t know how to receive more offers
len ratingone Doesn t work at all 
len ratingone Installed and it just shows a blank screen that you can t back out of 
len ratingone Worthless 
len ratingone  Nothing there to try review
len ratingone i don t know how to get a redeem code i would like to use the app i tried google to see if they know how i checked my mails and i didn t get anything if anyone can help me let me know
len ratingone Not useful
len ratingfive  This app is the best app I have ever used 
len ratingfive It lets you test new updates for your favorite apps 
len ratingfive You all should get it and try it 
len ratingfive  I m a beta tester that recently switched to iPhone from android is there any way I can switch my beta platform over to iOS without the waiting period for beta testing on Facebook messenger and Snapchat 
len ratingone it gives me no knowledge on how to use app or any sense of direction and cannot download a beta

len ratingone  I tested the newest version of the Yahoo Sports app but switched back to the previous version 
len ratingone A couple key points 
len ratingone The font changes have gone in the wrong direction 
len ratingone The headlines and article titles are blocky and more difficult to read 
len ratingone The scores and other information has a font that should be much larger plenty of open space is available to make game schedules scores bigger 
len ratingone Within the Home section game schedules scores are shown by listing the City College mascot names versus City College names 
len ratingone I obviously recognize my favorite teams names but don t always recognize their opponents 
len ratingone For example I don t know that the Yellow Jackets are from Georgia Tech

len ratingfive Are used to use YouTube when I was not knowledgeable about something but they help me and gives me more than what I need to get the job done
len ratingfive  Makes it easy to beta test
len ratingone Keeps asking me for a code Where is it
len ratingfive I think this is a really cool idea and app to be able to test and use to double check things before everyone gets to use it just to make sure all is good 
len ratingone No way to load update despite recent email saying to do so 
len ratingone No way to send message either to ONO or Test Flight 
len ratingone What good is this site 
len ratingfive  Finally an app that allows me to compare products 
len ratingfive This app is so useful love it 
len ratingone Before it was taken over by Apple it was actually useful

len ratingfive TestFlight is awesome
len ratingone Service trade has not worked correctly since this new update

len ratingone If you tell me I will give you stars
len ratingfive  Hi so cooooooool
len ratingfive  Hey how do I get the invitation 
len ratingfive  TestFlight was first introduced to me via TikTok which is an app that enables you to create your own music video clips the videos are just about seconds long or even less than seconds it depends on the audio choice that you want to use to create your own music video with you along with your friends and whomever else you want to have some fun with and create y alls own music video with y all singing along to your own choice of any of your most beloved songs 
len ratingfive It s like Dubsmash but the only similarity is that you get to basically lip sync along to any of your beloved songs that you have chosen for your video ANYWAYS enough of my babbling lol sorry my tiktok app when I tapped on the app to open it up on my iPhone a few weeks ago once it was opened up on my iPhone I had a new popup that came up immediately after the app opened and this popup was informing me of the opportunity that I had to test out a beta version of the app that included a new update that would add some extra features for us to have access to in the app but they had not yet officially made the update official yet except to some of the apps members including myself and that s when I found out about this app that I had never heard of till just recently that in order for me to have access to this beta version of the app with this newest update programmed into the app and that app was TestFlight so I tapped on 
len ratingfive the link that they provided for me that directly took me straight into the app store with the test flight app right before my eyes so that I was able to get the app installed on my iPhone and all I had to do was open up the testflight app and the tiktok s beta version of the app with the update was visible to me once I opened up the testflight app and all I had to do was tap on the tiktok beta app and it automatically was installed for me to test it out and see how this update worked on the app 
len ratingfive It s rather very simple to use once you have done a test of any of the apps that you were enabled to use via testflight 
len ratingtwo The testing is ok 
len ratingtwo I just can t send info to developer 
len ratingtwo I always have to contact them for the link 
len ratingfive  As a radio reporter in Washington DC I ve been using and trusting Ferrite on an iPhone for my daily field work since it was released 
len ratingfive It s never let me down 
len ratingfive The developers are constantly upgrading with new features and are very receptive to feedback and wishlist requests 
len ratingfive You can t spell Terrific without Ferrite Actually it s short an e bit close enough 
len ratingone  Lily
len ratingfive Thanks for your time and hard work for IOS musicians and producers 
len ratingone The age recommendation says but when I press continue it doesn t allow me to continue because I m not 
len ratingone That s just messed up

len ratingone Fix it 
len ratingfive How do I get the code to sign in
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive  I can easily test the beta programs
len ratingfive It works so good
len ratingone new system not user friendly
len ratingfour This app is another good improvement in Ring s integration of their video division with their alarm and security monitoring group 
len ratingfour I m impressed Rome wasn t built in a day 
len ratingone This version will still not allow me to synchronize with my iCloud calendar 
len ratingone Jim Combs
len ratingone It s not working
len ratingone  I downloaded it today and clicked agree but it didn t send me a invite code 
len ratingone Please help
len ratingfive I can find no improvements Never had a crash
len ratingfive I love love love this app that allows me to organize the bits and pieces of my life in one place 
len ratingfive I almost deducted a star to encourage the creator to add the possibility of a few more lists like the original Short List had 
len ratingfive Now I have an active shopping list a reminder list an immediate list all together on the one Short List 
len ratingfive I find Short List as great a tool as a calendar 
len ratingfive Looking forward to the update 
len ratingfive This app is very user friendly and cut my class prep time down considerably 
len ratingfive Struct Club made me a very happy spin instructor 
len ratingfive The new update is really simple and it s pleasure to use the app
len ratingfive  I am impressed
len ratingtwo I need a the code

len ratingthree Where is the extended cooling 
len ratingfive This is the best darn app I ve ever used in my whole life 
len ratingfive Thank
len ratingfive  TestFlight is super helpful 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive I was excited to do this as I d only done this once before with a different app 
len ratingfive  Tascam Initially I was disappointed because when I opened this app it said that nothing was available for testing 
len ratingfive Then I found the Foobar app and downloaded that figuring it s been released and that the beta testing period was finished 
len ratingfive I instantly realized the Foobar app is not the most user friendly 
len ratingfive So off to the forum I went 
len ratingfive There right at the top is the invite link 
len ratingfive I just signed up now so that s all I have to say but I ll come back and edit this throughout my research 
len ratingfive I hope this helped at least one of you out there who were in the same boat 
len ratingfive So far so good 
len ratingfive GYYYO 
len ratingfour I have been using TestFlight for months now doing beta testing for a social media app 
len ratingfour One thing that I run have ran into before is when I ve gotten invited to beta test and when pressing on the link it asked me to redeem my code 
len ratingfour Now I ve used the app before and was able to redeem my code but whenever I press redeem i don t get a code am not offered one 
len ratingfour Not only that but because I was unable to redeem my code because I wasn t provided one the app told me that it was the app developer that sent my beta test invitation s fault and that I needed to email the developer and ask for a new invitation 
len ratingfour The app that I was beta testing for gladly gave me another invitation and that beta test ran out 
len ratingfour This same thing has also happened to me a second time 
len ratingfour Other than this one thing I think the app is wonderful 
len ratingfive Nice game to play if you have a few minutes or a few hours 
len ratingtwo The only problem I ve had in a few years of use is simple dumb one for an app that doesn t appear to do much 
len ratingtwo When I sent email feedback to an app developer the email didn t disappear when I pressed the send button 
len ratingtwo So I pressed send several times 
len ratingtwo I found it had sent several copies of the email 
len ratingtwo How does that get thru the most basic testing 
len ratingone  And that is very annoying
len ratingfive Was very easy to download 
len ratingfive Still to early in the ballgame to give a full review 
len ratingfive  Not much to really say about this app just that it s necessary if you wish to participate in beta apps for iOS 
len ratingfive It has a nice clean design it s easy to join leave betas get notified or download new betas etc 
len ratingfive Love the beta testing
len ratingtwo It s asking for a reedem code which one do not exist and don t let you advance to the register process 
len ratingone  I did not install any beta or otherwise testing apps I ve been hacked 
len ratingfour  You can t stop testing the app when you are remove from the developers 
len ratingfour The app icon will come back after flash the list 
len ratingfive  Last update description doesn t really make any sense 
len ratingfive Did you mean of updating in the app 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingfive I can t get into it because there is some code I need
len ratingfive It s nice feature try an test an update before it comes out

len ratingthree It would be great if we can add notes before uploading 
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Honestly
len ratingone This app specifically says it will work with iS

len ratingone I force quilt both the app under test and TestFlight and tried again no luck

len ratingone So when I was setting up the app I accidentally forgot to put in email or phone number and now whenever I delete the app and re download it stays on the page where it says redeem and start testing games 
len ratingone I don t know if I m supposed to wait for a code to be texted to me but I can t go back to put in an email or phone number so until I get a code or go back to the app set up one star for now
len ratingone I m so sad because I was ivited to test flight but I didn t think it was one of those things you gotta do immediately so I didn t save the code and a few weeks later I tried it and can t get in this is so dumb thanks a lot test flight 
len ratingfive I was invited to use this app for my TLV Journey App
len ratingone didnt tell me invite code in email just the agreements
len ratingfive  I haven t used it a ton yet but I do like that you can test beta versions of an app and still have the full version of the app installed as well 
len ratingfive That way files on the full version are not at risk of being corrupted for damaged 
len ratingfive Schnell Stark stablen 
len ratingfive Quiero un c digo
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingone Can t get it to work 
len ratingone It never sent me the code to complete installation
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone So frustrating
len ratingfive I was skeptical going into using this app but was very surprised and actually impressed with the app 
len ratingfive The content in it is modern trending and there are videos as well as reading content 
len ratingfive Highly recommend and plan to use it lots more 
len ratingone The moment i installed the app it opens the popup for ARE YOU ENJOYING THE APP 
len ratingone RATE NOW 
len ratingone Yea if you would at least let me use the app first that would be great 
len ratingone Here take your one star review and go away
len ratingone Why do we need a invitation can t we just go into the app with out all this hustle
len ratingfour I did not see the code to get in so I can t use this app please tell me what the code is
len ratingfive You should have this app if you care about your and your family s health 
len ratingfour The set up was very lengthy but I understand the reason 
len ratingfour Happy to beta test new versions of apps 
len ratingfour Only problem 
len ratingfour It should download as a beta instead of replacing the current version of the app and there shouldn t be a chance of losing all data with that app 
len ratingone Doesn t work 
len ratingone Where is the code 
len ratingone How about some instructions 
len ratingfive Awesome game 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive I feel like my time using the app is appreciated and my opinion is valued by inviting me to test the future of an app 
len ratingfive I changed all my passwords 
len ratingfive They are all different from each other 
len ratingfive Also I checked the breach activity 
len ratingfive I thought the app was but the app is more informative instead of active hands on to help me clean my online footprint 
len ratingfive I did not try the premium version though 
len ratingone  I tried it I didn t like it I deleted it I tried to unsubscribe to it IT S THE EMAIL FROM HELL 
len ratingtwo Pro tip if I ve just started using your app less than minutes ago and you ask me to rate it and I say not now if you ask me to rate it again less than minutes later you will not be reviewed favorably 
len ratingfive Awesome way to make money 
len ratingfive I rented all my unused items in this app and made money 
len ratingfive  invitation code
len ratingfive Everything seems to be working like normal 
len ratingfive No issues 
len ratingfour Really is a great app
len ratingfive  Amazingly designed simple and useful
len ratingfive just got my trova and have been waiting for it for awhile 
len ratingfive I will keep you posted
len ratingfive That s
len ratingfive Ll
len ratingone Annoying
len ratingfive I m amazed at the level of savviness 
len ratingfive Coooooooool
len ratingfive Wow 
len ratingone I need a code to redeem 
len ratingone Give me one please 
len ratingfour I have installed the TestFlight app but I didn t receive a verification code 
len ratingfour I can t get in 
len ratingfour Help 
len ratingfour Day I found the code and have gotten in 
len ratingfour It was astounding to see how many accounts I have 
len ratingfour I have some work to do 
len ratingthree  I have installed the TestFlight app but I didn t receive a verification code 
len ratingthree I can t get in 
len ratingthree Help 
len ratingone This is soo annoying taking up my time
len ratingfive This is the best app to have fun and be yourself
len ratingtwo I was offered a test of this program and it never allowed me to redeem my access
len ratingfive Muy buena me gusta
len ratingone how do u get invitation code 
len ratingone it wont show for me 
len ratingone Didn t get code 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingfive For the end user this app seems to be accessible 
len ratingfive I did not have any trouble testing the app that I was asked to review
len ratingfive I m a new tester and had received an invite by BeatStars app and so far I ve had an amazing experience 
len ratingfive Cant wait for more invites by other apps 
len ratingone Bad when I tried to install the app system just asked my redeem code 
len ratingone Where is that 
len ratingone Invalid code so can t even see the app 
len ratingfive Using notecastr I m able to find key points in a podcast without going into a podcast blind to find a key point in an hour long podcast 
len ratingfive This saves a ton of time and helps find relevant points 
len ratingfive Well done 
len ratingfive Binge watching at its best 
len ratingtwo I don t know how t get a code
len ratingone Here s your review 
len ratingfive Thank you for your hard working skills
len ratingone Never got a code 
len ratingone No way to request new one
len ratingfive I ve been noticeably better at remembering the names of the people I meet 
len ratingfive A 
len ratingtwo I don t know what the app is like because I can t get an email for an invitation code 
len ratingtwo Can someone help me 
len ratingtwo I ve waited like minutes and still nothing 
len ratingfive Best game EVER 
len ratingfive Although I am new to these type of products I am impressed by the easy installation and the data analysis program available through the free app 
len ratingfive It is useful for performance fuel efficiency and possibly street tuning a vehicle 
len ratingfive I took a few minutes browsing through the app and found a lot of helpful information about my car 
len ratingfive I m glad to own a product so well designed 
len ratingfive This app takes control of my Credit card debt and makes a plane to where I won t be in it anymore 
len ratingone  It be nice to get that redeem code 
len ratingone I wasn t even given the option to put in my email and now I can t even go back to put one in 
len ratingone What f ing BS 
len ratingone Wants me to redeem a code from my email but won t send a code to my email 
len ratingone Application doesn t work with iPhones 
len ratingfive I hope you pay me Apple 
len ratingfive We ll see I ll write in again if it works or not X SC ATX
len ratingthree The app is requesting an id number haven t found it as of right now 
len ratingtwo This is an application for beta testing other applications 
len ratingtwo A place where review notes matter 
len ratingtwo With that in mind why are notes hidden and truncated after a few brief lines behind a more info button 
len ratingtwo Let all the release notes be on screen and scrollable without having to tap a button with a tap target that is muuuuch too small 
len ratingfive I m loving the app so far it s very addicting I must say since it s so similar to Instagram yet I m earning money for those things now 
len ratingfive I look forward to the upcoming features as well since we are only allowed to post edit the profile like and search things 
len ratingfive Runs very smooth and I would like some type of verification badge like you see now on social media for being an early adopter just throwing that out there 
len ratingfive Nice job 
len ratingone I never got my email is there anyway you can send another code to my email
len ratingfive Kind of rough getting started 
len ratingfive Wow
len ratingone Only reason for low review is because I have had the app downloaded for minute and it s asked to be reviewed twice 
len ratingfive What a nice app for our best customers 
len ratingfive The won t want to book on their desktops after they see this 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It keeps all my personal and business passwords safe and secure 
len ratingfive I love this as a paramedic as well as an ACLS lead instructor 
len ratingfive Working great auto reconnect sometimes flaky
len ratingone It s not telling me how to redeem 
len ratingone Still using the old app
len ratingone Where is the redeem code 
len ratingfive Cannot stop playing 
len ratingfive User friendly 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate through the order 
len ratingfive Easy to select or delete a menu option 
len ratingfive Like to drill down menu instructions very detailed 
len ratingthree Idk what the redeem code is
len ratingfive I am satisfied with the performance of TestFlight and ProtonVPN 
len ratingone I have only used it to install two betas which probably took a total of one minute but Testflight did its job admirably 
len ratingone Nevertheless putting pop ups in your program to demand that I review the product and which won t go away unless I do is a bad way to treat your customers 
len ratingone Edit I rated it and wrote the review above and it still is popping up messages asking me to rate it 
len ratingone What is your problem 
len ratingtwo App ngu nh c t
len ratingfive Thanks now my brains don t have to work to much I love that
len ratingthree So I download the app and it asks for an Invitation code AFTER I was invited to try the app 
len ratingthree I never saw a code 
len ratingthree Update was asked a second time with no code 
len ratingfive Very helpful for drivers 
len ratingfive New update saves battery 
len ratingtwo I didn t get any redeemed code
len ratingfive Outstanding quality of video
len ratingone I can no longer post a comment on Facebook 
len ratingone I did the latest update 
len ratingone I write a comment and when I select post it crashes the app and sometimes my whole phone 
len ratingthree Should be easier to get 
len ratingthree Service from others for this should be available ASAP
len ratingfive Look forward to rendering a good review in the future
len ratingfive We really like testing games apss
len ratingthree  I would love the playlist on the app could have songs and a mix for tracks on iPhone app LIKE ECERY OTHER SERVICE 
len ratingthree But other than that you surpass other services in other features 
len ratingthree Better sound quality better search more music better selection 
len ratingthree You are improving on not having songs repeat which was your weakest point 
len ratingthree Getting a lot better but not perfect 
len ratingthree Thanks for improving 
len ratingone I didn t receive my email and one of my apps won t work that I need this is unacceptable 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive It lets me test and play game early
len ratingone I don t know what my code is
len ratingone How do I get my invite code
len ratingfive Just downloaded it might do a edit but I give a star looks good
len ratingfive Allows me the opportunity to test new apps first
len ratingone I didn t even get a redeem code to sign in this is so stupid
len ratingfive Working good
len ratingone There s a YouTuber called yub he played cyber hunters now I wanna try it but I can t and it s annoying plz send me a code
len ratingone Can t get a code 
len ratingone i ve never received a redemption code and it s been three days 
len ratingone It s asking for a redeem code which I never got and it just sits there and won t let me do anything
len ratingfive Excellent learning app for the kids
len ratingfour Good work keep it up
len ratingtwo Only use it cause I have to 
len ratingtwo App could be a lot lot better
len ratingone I tried to download this app and the pop up for rating this app wouldn t go away 
len ratingone So I hope this review makes you happy 
len ratingone So far I don t even have a clue what TestFlight does 
len ratingfour Using TestFlight to beta test a new app from Netvue Vuebell gave me a chance to get a first look and try of some of the new features that I ve been waiting for 
len ratingfour It also allowed me to send feedback and suggestions for improvements to the company 
len ratingfour Enjoying the opportunity on this service 
len ratingfive There are so many improvements to the new version of Collector such as displaying the maps by predefined groups significant improvement to provide user ability to accurately digitize location for new feature and display of legend just to name a few 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone I don t understand how on the label it says but the app says you must be thirteen to be able to do test flight 
len ratingone I want to be able to test run games and see what they can be before I can download it 
len ratingone I can t join because I went to fast and didn t hit the send email button
len ratingone I did a test flight for Oilist 
len ratingone Part of the deal was I get a free copy after the test 
len ratingone I never got a free copy and the TestFlight copy stopped working 
len ratingone Deleted 
len ratingfour  I was invited to run the beta for the leading professional social networking app 
len ratingfour I didn t ask to run it in beta nor really was I suspecting it 
len ratingfour I have now been running TestFlight and the beta of the app for over a month now 
len ratingfour I believe due to who the dev is for the app I don t really have issue nor do the betas seem that different 
len ratingfour I might just be missing it but I would really appreciate a place on here to give the product managers some feedback or feature requests 
len ratingfour I understand this might be more so user testing in terms of stability time used and features used but I assume I requested to do this because I m a power user so being able to ask for something I believe is a useful feature I believe is a must if this platform is for improving the app testing 
len ratingfour I however work in finance not tech is I might be missing the point of what I m doing here 
len ratingfour That why I gave this stars there are features I would like to see but I think this is more of an analytical suite for devs and less of a platform for customers to tell pm what they want most out of the app 
len ratingone Says I am not longer connected to internet 
len ratingone Reinstalled same problem 
len ratingfive Nice
len ratingfive How do i get a TestFlight invite code
len ratingfour The only problem I have is the rating 
len ratingfour Says it s but you gotta be and older to use 
len ratingfive Been using beatstars for about months now and my fan base as been rising 
len ratingfive Testing so far is good
len ratingone It giving me the redeem code
len ratingfive This App is working great 
len ratingfive I get updates immediately and the App is smooth as silk 
len ratingone No instructions on how to get a code
len ratingthree I downloaded this app to help affect my singing voice and I skipped the first part and it turns out I needed that redeem code sent to me but I did not Care to look and figure it out I needed a redeem code 
len ratingthree I deleted the app and re downloaded it but it took me right back to the next part where are you words to put in my redeem code which I did not have 
len ratingthree So now I cannot use this app 
len ratingthree Hopefully this will be fixed soon 
len ratingone The process to install Beta applications via TestFlight used to be much more fluid 
len ratingone Now I need to copy and paste a redemption code in order to access apps 
len ratingone I m also experiencing an issue whereby I can no longer install an app on my device despite having granted access to it 
len ratingone In the App Store Connect dashboard my Apple ID is listed as having installed the app however Testflight lists the app as inaccessible as I m no longer listed as a tester 
len ratingone Even if I remove the app from the Testlfight client and remove my account from the dashboard and re send the invitation I still don t have access 
len ratingone This has made reviews very difficult as I cannot use my own credentials and fear the same issue may happen to other associated accounts 
len ratingfive I ve been testing two apps and TestFlight makes it easy to test and provide feedback to developers for any issues 
len ratingfive Great idea to have non tech people using who can provide feedback 
len ratingfive Best app ever made 
len ratingone For two days now no matter what I try to do the new app I m trying to test will not install on my device because TestFlight chronically says TestFlight is currently unavailable 
len ratingone Try again later It tells me this in three different devices using WiFi and cell phone data after deleting and reinstalling after turning off and back on after trying a variety of internal and external public invitations augghhh 
len ratingone Any help would be appreciated and would restore a star rating for TestFlight 
len ratingone The app is requiring a code to use it 
len ratingone No code was provided when I downloaded it 
len ratingone It is a useless app 
len ratingtwo  So I download the app and it asks for an Invitation code AFTER I was invited to try the app 
len ratingtwo I never saw a code 
len ratingfour Loving this security app 
len ratingone Don t nag for ratings 
len ratingthree i got an invitation on tiktok i clicked on it made my download it and then said i needed a code that i never got so 
len ratingone I can t open the app because it s asking for a code to redeem that I ve not been given yet 
len ratingfive I downloaded the app and as soon as I opened it it ask for an invitation code to redeem 
len ratingfive I didn t even get to sign up or enter my email it went straight to the redeem invitation code which I don t have
len ratingfive See the title
len ratingone I can t find the redeem code
len ratingone Does not work
len ratingone  Tried to log in to watch tonight and it told me to try again later so if the code worked the app isn t 
len ratingfive I ve been on it for years and it s amazing anyone that s sad or bored should try this thing 
len ratingfive I use it for work and it works as expected
len ratingfive Excellent way of testing a new app before it goes into the Apple App Store
len ratingone I downloaded this app and can t seem to even create an account
len ratingone  I have only used it to install two betas which probably took a total of one minute but Testflight did its job admirably 
len ratingone Nevertheless putting pop ups in your program to demand that I review the product and which won t go away unless I do is a bad way to treat your customers 
len ratingone It asked me about redeem code to start But there is no redeem code 
len ratingfive Works out of the box
len ratingone I decided not to test the requested app although I was really interested on it 
len ratingone The reason was there was no clear information about what would happen the current app installed and the information on it 
len ratingone How to go back to the app in case I didn t like it etc 
len ratingone Good intentions badly managed 
len ratingfive Meaad
len ratingfive Where is the code in my e mail 
len ratingone Stop asking me to rate this ridiculous app while I am trying to use it
len ratingfive This app is helping me remember a line monologue for a play 
len ratingfive  As a singer this could help me learn cover songs faster Thanks developers and beta testers 
len ratingfive I don t get this lol
len ratingtwo  testing app
len ratingfive Apple is terrible 
len ratingfive Enjoy the koolaid
len ratingfive Fahad
len ratingfive Love this application thank you all 
len ratingfive Seems to be working on iOS 
len ratingthree I got an invite and downloaded the app but when i tried to accept it didn t let me 
len ratingthree I wanted to try this out but apparently not 
len ratingone I got an email to try TestFlight I thought it may be good to try it 
len ratingone When I started it it asked me to download another software finally I got a cloud media player which I don t like it 
len ratingfive Being my first encounter with Test Flight I really don t have a lot to talk about but so far it s working great and I m loving it 
len ratingfive Simple user friendly and very useful especially in the field
len ratingfive I have absolutely enjoyed the apps I have in TestFlight I don t mind a few glitches or the encourage feedback to make an awesome app for everyone 
len ratingfive It takes time and dedication 
len ratingfive I welcome more apps in my TestFlight folder 
len ratingfive Thanks iTunes 
len ratingfive  Apple
len ratingfive good
len ratingfive So far it is doing what is design do however should l a find fault or any faults l will report them but at this moment l have not experience any problems
len ratingthree I m and I want to beta test some apps but I am too young so could you make an adjustment please 
len ratingone Stop asking for reviews before I ve used it 
len ratingone Also tbh it s not intuitive and a very annoying barrier of entry to beta test any apps 
len ratingone Doesn t connect to camera
len ratingfive I am so grateful for ezBid 
len ratingfive I have used it for years but as of recently with the blending of bases and work groups I don t know what I would do with out it 
len ratingfive Thank You Scott for fighting to make it better each month 
len ratingfive I don t know where you find the time to do all you do 
len ratingfive Just know you are much appreciated
len ratingfive This is amazing 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingone I was sending beta feedback for an app I m testing 
len ratingone In the middle of this I get a pop up asking me to rate Test Flight 
len ratingone I could not complete the rating because on screen keyboard was blocking part of pop up window 
len ratingone I could not collapse keyboard and I could not send the feedback for the app I was testing 
len ratingone The only way out was to close Test Flight losing everything that I typed 
len ratingone Enjoy your star rating 
len ratingone I d give Zero if I could 
len ratingfive Best app we are looking forward to use
len ratingfive I needed this 
len ratingfour buena para las betas
len ratingfive  I ve used this app for at least a year now and have found it always working perfectly 
len ratingfive What more can you ask for 
len ratingfive NADA 
len ratingone I can t use it until they send the redeem code
len ratingfive A quick and fun way to tag and categorize anyone in your phone book 
len ratingfive I like the opportunity to be one of the first to try upgrades on Google Maps 
len ratingfive I use Maps for everything finding phone numbers finding locations navigating you name it 
len ratingone I even got another pop up while writing this 
len ratingone Why is an Apple app doing this pathetic review grab 
len ratingfive I ve been using this app for years and it s one of the best purchases I ve made 
len ratingfive I have about six different google calendars synced to it and it has worked flawlessly 
len ratingfive Anytime I ve had the slightest issue with it I email the developer who is very responsive and fixes things quickly 
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingone Is good for nothing
len ratingfive It s on point and helpful what it should be
len ratingfive Love this 
len ratingfive This is a very stand out app 
len ratingfive One of a kind 
len ratingfive I feel better than ever 
len ratingone I said it all in the title 
len ratingthree The app seems delightful and a great way to see how the future of apps will shape out but there should be an easier way to share your email with a developer instead of posting it on some random site 
len ratingfive this is what we need nice and simple 
len ratingthree Please stop hounding me every time I open the app to leave feedback 
len ratingthree If you want validation go hound your QA department 
len ratingone can t get a code
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone I have tried to load test flight 
len ratingone It is just loaded and needs redeem code and I have no email
len ratingone In the middle of an installation workflow is not a time to interrupt begging for an App Store review 
len ratingfive I didn t know my average mood until I used Wheel Potential 
len ratingfive I feel better already 
len ratingone I have not been able to get a code to activate the app 
len ratingfive  Great way to test early updates 
len ratingfive I ve tested four so far 
len ratingfive One went on to fruition 
len ratingfive Two I decided I didn t like the way they were evolving 
len ratingfive I quit testing them deleted the apps and found alternatives 
len ratingfive One I m still testing and enjoying the continual improvements 
len ratingfive It has been a special pleasure to see the bugs fixes and new features in advance 
len ratingfive And to get an idea of how developers work 
len ratingfive Great run app 
len ratingfive Helps to keep me aware of my pace real time 
len ratingfive LOVE the release to start 
len ratingone Can t open it 
len ratingone No email 
len ratingone Nothing 
len ratingone The instructions to redeem invitation code were no where to be found following the instructions given 
len ratingone L
len ratingone Test flight asked me for a code to redeem but I have never received on Not a great start
len ratingfive I lost weight using this app
len ratingone Everything went smoothly during installation and opening of app with invitation 
len ratingone But adding my favorites wasn t easy 
len ratingone The app froze during Navigation back and forth from a z listing of stores 
len ratingone Then after signing in again I ve been unable to get to main page and am somewhat stuck 
len ratingone I ll try again because I want to provide feedback on the full experience purchase to delivery but it s been tough so far 
len ratingone Will keep you posted 
len ratingone Txs for the opportunity to test it 
len ratingfive Apps made by little known developers that we can use 
len ratingfive You bet I m in 
len ratingfive Super fun getting in on the ground floor 
len ratingfive Exciting opportunities abound 
len ratingfive This app makes soapbox derby racing even more fun 
len ratingfive Easy to use and fast like a good app should be 
len ratingone Unsatisfactory will let me sign in on my Windows laptop but will not let me sign in on my IPHONE 
len ratingfive So far the only problem that I have run into is that at times it holds up the opening of games 
len ratingfive Other then that I have had no problems 
len ratingfive Good
len ratingthree Be aware that sometimes Waze will take you on a bunny trail that is off course 
len ratingthree I have had that happen at least or times 
len ratingthree Some make no sense at all 
len ratingfive Yeniel
len ratingtwo im trying to log in but it won t let me
len ratingfive  Real interesting can t wait to use it more
len ratingone Put user name and password in and it doesn t let me log in
len ratingfive Very fast 
len ratingfive Love the shake for help function 
len ratingfive Love how I can tap a flight or hotel card and it shows me the trade offs between the flight I picked and the cheapest flight comfort flight duration if it s always late etc 
len ratingfour So far good
len ratingfive  NotePlan has the potential to disrupt the burgeoning GTD Task Management and Notes market offerings 
len ratingfive Very few apps in the ecosystem combine task management and meaningful read formatted note taking without pigeonholing users into inflexible workflow methodologies 
len ratingfive It s refreshing not to feel overwhelmed with yet another rigid set of rules that s often in conflict with my natural organic way of getting things done 
len ratingone I haven t even gotten my first app loaded and it s harassing me for a review 
len ratingfive very good
len ratingthree It is highly annoying 
len ratingfour  app app testflight stop testing testflight testflight app testflight 
len ratingfour  The beta greats and all except the comment that keeps coming up when people comment on the show movie is really annoying and should consider making the comment that pop up disappear
len ratingfive This app is awesome
len ratingfive It s very helpful thanks for this amazing app
len ratingtwo  Spotify is probably the largest music app that has not implemented Siri Shortcuts yet 
len ratingtwo It s quite sad 
len ratingtwo Now that iOS finally allows any app to use Siri Shortcuts Spotify has no plans of using it and even claims that it s Apples fault 
len ratingtwo I have been using Spotify since day on when they released in the USA and I think this is the strew the broke the camel s back for me now I m considering switching to Apple Music 
len ratingfive Hi
len ratingfive Great app that let s you scroll through an art museum when you aren t able to stroll in one 
len ratingfive Love the ability to decide categories 
len ratingfive Super hard but very close to real wave strategy 
len ratingfive This is a great app for testing beta software 
len ratingone Send me the code to redeem please 
len ratingone I can t rate without knowing how the app even works 
len ratingfive Awesome 
len ratingfive Great game 
len ratingfive Can t get better in scheduling 
len ratingfive Beyond facebook and Google plus 
len ratingfive My app of choice going forward 
len ratingfive Wonderful app 
len ratingfive Easy to use and very helpful 
len ratingfive This is hands down the best app for pre flight plans and doing missions 
len ratingfive Works very well allowing to beta test a few apps and provide feedback 
len ratingfour  Slightly and also greatly enjoy using this app omw to the MAY invites When only me myself i are entertainment for all media applemusic allappleapps 
len ratingfour keep me posted on my new iphonex
len ratingfive Excellent app like an App Store for development 
len ratingfive Easy to add testers for your product
len ratingfive Hands down the best Dartboard app I ve ever used 
len ratingfive I m in love with this app but then again I love beta testing drone apps 
len ratingtwo Not sure where the problem is but when I get an email that there is a new test flight available I click the link in the email and it takes me to a screen that says test flight must be installed it is 
len ratingtwo So I go to the App Store click on the app open button since it is already installed and then activate the test flight 
len ratingfive The fact i can call myself pilot is a dream come true 
len ratingfive Thanks s for the name of your app u could ve called it Beta tester or such other 
len ratingfive But the use if flight means a pilot or such similar operator S Mafiaagang ogmackdrama I am Lucious Lyon
len ratingfive I like very good app
len ratingone  I have no clue why they downloaded this on to my iPad Oh wait a minute so they can charge me storage that s right
len ratingfive Ngon b r 
len ratingfive This deserves stars plz dislike and kill
len ratingfive Lover
len ratingfive TestFlight is now more useful and easy for all testers
len ratingfive Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing
len ratingone Apps should just show up without me accepting the invite via email 
len ratingthree All of my app s builds expires 
len ratingthree Uploaded a new build to appstoreconnect Expected TestFlight should show the new build as available for testing Actual Nothing changed in the app even after a manual pull to refresh on the apps split pane 
len ratingthree I had to force quit and restart TestFlight to see my build 
len ratingfive I ve had fun posting objects for worldbit users to see it is truly a worldwide market place 
len ratingfive I hope to see more people on here soon 
len ratingfive Installed TestFlight for a specific app and am now using it to access another for beta testing 
len ratingfive The first is an app I use every day and will be in perpetual development 
len ratingfive The new one is a smaller niche app I ve been hoping for 
len ratingfive TestFlight should smooth the beta development stage and help the smaller app by establishing a development path consistent with the big ones 
len ratingfive Very good 
len ratingfive I absolutely love this tide app 
len ratingfive Finally a tide app that is easy to read with an awesome look 
len ratingone Updates way too much and don t understand why cause it s all the same 
len ratingone My understanding is that you won t let me submit because you don t want a bad review but that s the reality so stop lying to your costumers 
len ratingone Generally a great tool but they push an update too often in recent months and it refuses to work with an outdated version 
len ratingone Stop making frivolous updates just to waste my bandwidth effort and time 
len ratingfive Awesome app being able to collaborate with people across the world 
len ratingfive Has really help promote my outside career having people hear me then look me up on Instagram and all music outlets 
len ratingfive I was stagnant for a long time until I saw this app and all the different kind of beats 
len ratingfive The only two things I can recommend is linking these beats to the producers outside market to make it easier to collaborate with them 
len ratingfive I usually just google and hope I find them 
len ratingfive Another is a lot of songs people ask to do a remix but I would have to re record all over again

len ratingfive The only issue I ran into was when it came to uploading your own photo into the backs of the flash cards 
len ratingfive The pictures ended up a bit blurry for me 
len ratingfive Other than that this achieves exactly what it is trying to and is a fun little app 
len ratingfive I highly recommend 
len ratingone I have no idea if the app is good or not this early on

len ratingfive  I appreciate the services from Nexar 
len ratingfive It saved my and from police 
len ratingfive Some guy reverse hi car and hit my car and my car damaged from front and then he calaims that I hit his car 
len ratingfive The private Dash cams do not accepted officially 
len ratingfive The one is Nexar approved by TLC and DMV

len ratingfive And the speed also displayed in video 
len ratingfive The video is un editable 
len ratingfive Very good choice 
len ratingfive You will get double money back each month by getting discount on insurance 
len ratingfive So actually it is free and it pats you every month 
len ratingfive QuickTutor is truly one of a kind 
len ratingfive I can literally teach anyone and learn anything and get payed for it

len ratingone For some reason I did not receive a code to redeem on TestFlight 
len ratingone So it doesn t even allow me to continue to the app 
len ratingone That s all folks
len ratingtwo So slow the beta test app almost couldn t be downloaded
len ratingone Can t use without redeem code Can t get a redeem code What is the point 
len ratingone This has been one problem after another with this app
len ratingfive Yes
len ratingfive  Handy app
len ratingone No matter how much I try or how many times I get sent the code I check my email over and over and it s never there 
len ratingone Test flight gave me an invite but with no code
len ratingfive Google apps on my iPad always work as I expected 
len ratingfive The camera and other iPad features work perfectly for me when I am using Google programs 
len ratingone How do I become a Beta tester 
len ratingone The app makes it very hard to find your redemption code 
len ratingone Once redeemed I can t find it for the next update 
len ratingone It doesn t give me a redeem code
len ratingfive  Outstanding platform to test betas
len ratingone Better timing please
len ratingfour Great way to test but doesn t update automatically
len ratingfour How do I go about getting a code to redeem 
len ratingone After downloading this to my weight watchers app my perfectly functional app started to glitch 
len ratingone Everything I scanned came up points 
len ratingone I tried to fix the problem and now I m kicked out of the weight watchers app 
len ratingone It s so frustrating 
len ratingone The app is asking for a review 
len ratingone So they are getting it 
len ratingone They request a redemption code which they don t send you 
len ratingone I can t imagine what they are dreaming of 
len ratingone Do they want me to make something up 
len ratingone Is this a test of imagination 
len ratingone Are they trying to be irritating 
len ratingone Do they want me to hate them 
len ratingone The net promoter score of 
len ratingone A hopeless mess
len ratingfive This system is good for testing
len ratingone TestFlight was working great before it was acquired by Apple allowed to distribute builds freely and worked on iOS and Android 
len ratingone You want developers to seriously tell you what we think 
len ratingfive  Features packed solid and reliable excellent app for navigating which gets constantly updating with new features 
len ratingfive I wouldn t even consider any other one 
len ratingfive Not only practical and informative this app will also make your trip more fun and entertaining 
len ratingfive Great job to the developer who keeps fine tuning and listening to users input and requests 
len ratingone Use the app all the time but was suddenly remove not sure why no reason given 
len ratingfive Related to UISplitViewController
len ratingfive Love this app 
len ratingfive It accurately does my voicemail to text better than Verizon 
len ratingfive Broadcast messaging is a cinch with the app too 
len ratingfive Not to mention getting data into forms and gathering surveys 
len ratingone The app is fine but a rating nag means one star 
len ratingone Never get anything
len ratingfive What a nice way to incorporate a larger audience into beta testing 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingone It s says in the App Store But then when you get the app u have to be years old I m only but I loveee technology that is so unfair
len ratingfive Love it for betas have played and all the games have been released even better the the beta
len ratingone  The app never sent me an invitation code and won t allow me to redeem or resend it to myself
len ratingone I am unable to load the beta versions 
len ratingone When I open test flight I get a redeem code message and when I open it from the invitation I get a couldn t load app the version is no longer available for testing 
len ratingone The version is only a few hours old 
len ratingfive This is a great app for beta testing 
len ratingfive I have had to send so much feedback to other companies so they can keep up to date with the current version of the iOS
len ratingone Have been waiting for days to get an invitation 
len ratingfive Its like having a bionic Rolodex personal assistant and computer tech all combined into one 
len ratingfive A definite necessity 
len ratingfive  We hope to support Arabic and Dark Mode
len ratingone Pretty bad experience for new users 
len ratingfive it s cool
len ratingfour Auto updates are the one missing feature
len ratingfive TestFlight is really useful for testing apps before releasing them to the public
len ratingone It asked me to rate it every time I installed a test build so I gave it star
len ratingfive Abylai is a genius 
len ratingfive This will be the Uber of the service industry
len ratingfive Nice design syncing capabilities feature set and a really handy companion for anything that needs to be noted down 
len ratingfive I m a beginner at this

len ratingfive Soothing and relaxing 
len ratingfive Try it

len ratingfive I did test it out and worked great so far 
len ratingfive I really like this idea 
len ratingfive Thanks a lot
len ratingfour Overall I like the app but there has been a couple of times the app did not load when st turned on 
len ratingone I didn t get a invite code
len ratingone I appreciate the attempt but every time I open the app it ends in frustration 
len ratingone It constantly crashes 
len ratingone Ever since the Stern channel has been updated the rest of the app channels have become annoying to try to navigate 
len ratingone Now Thom Hartmann has been reduced to two hours which is quite possibly the straw that broke the camel s back 
len ratingone I may finally end my misery and cancel my subscription and listen to podcasts instead 
len ratingone I can t even get on I ve been invited on the app by a notification on social media but wasn t given a code 
len ratingone So I don t know
len ratingfive It is the coolest 
len ratingfive CHEFLORD Team Seattle WA Great responsiveness and sophistication 
len ratingfive Chef Saias
len ratingthree No client understands the pain getting stuck in the processing build for TestFlight
len ratingtwo It I m waiting to redeem my code but I have been waiting for a while and it still hasn t gave me a code
len ratingtwo I dread updating my beta app via TestFlight because my entire phone comes to a standstill UI hangs buttons don t work etc for more than minute when I update

len ratingone Tried to access beta site several times 
len ratingone Kept kicking me back to landing page as if I had to start over 
len ratingone No birthday date month or year options rendered 
len ratingone Don t know if that had anything to do with my problems 
len ratingone It was usually when I got to the birthday fields that I was kicked off 
len ratingone I don t have any invitation code
len ratingfive Even though I can t get in The actual app I have been chosen so I m gonna try and get in and I m going to update you guys later
len ratingone Where is the redeem code 
len ratingone No auto refreshes
len ratingfive Wow 
len ratingfive Today is my st day using TestFlight as a beta user for an app and I m extremely amazed at the responses I get from the developers 
len ratingfive I send an email and they reply immediately 
len ratingfive That s amazing and unheard of 
len ratingfive I will be back to see how Test Flight has been working out for me as I mentioned today is my st day 
len ratingfive Thanx roXstar
len ratingone I have no complaints that the app kept asking me NONSTOP if I was enjoying it

len ratingfive  This app has changed my life 
len ratingfive Along with the freestyle libre sensor and the blucon nightrider transmitter I can actually go to sleep now and not worry about severe low blood sugars happening sporadically while I am asleep 
len ratingfive I have worried about lows in the middle of the night for the last years 
len ratingfive The money I save using this app compared to the other cgms out there is substantial 
len ratingfive My last Ac was and that was a true number not a number that was lower because of many low blood sugars 
len ratingfive I hope this app never goes away because my life would suffer if it did 
len ratingfive Can t say thanks enough 
len ratingfive This app is gonna change the way we challenge and compete for years to come 
len ratingfive Why has it taken so long 
len ratingone Why is is so difficult to setup test accounts 
len ratingone What do it mean redmeen code

len ratingthree Great game just some issues with reconnection after a disconnect
len ratingfour App is crashing often and there hasn t been an update in a while 
len ratingfour What s shakin Firefox 
len ratingfive This app is simple in what it does and it does it well 
len ratingone So recently Test Flight started popping up nag screens to rate it 
len ratingone But you only use Test Flight because you want to test some other app 
len ratingone Asking me to rate Test Flight itself is like asking me to rate the concept of beta testing which some reviewers actually seem to be doing 
len ratingone So now I have to put up with this nag screen to rate Test Flight so some out of control product manager at Apple can brag about metrics for their promotion 
len ratingone To hopefully make it go away I submit this rating one star 
len ratingfive Site was easy to navigate 
len ratingfive Can t wait to use the ap to see who is playing in my neighborhood 
len ratingone Been days what s the point of keeping it around 
len ratingfive It s a really good app for installing updating software betas when you ve joined the beta test at the developer s request 
len ratingfive The app facilitates the quid pro quo of beta versions you get cool new apps and the developer gets to work out any kinks before official release 
len ratingfive Recommend 
len ratingfive This is SO funny to drive with 
len ratingfive Turn your directions on and laugh all the way to your destination 
len ratingfive And also get cursed out a little 
len ratingfive  A million thumbs up 
len ratingfive Very well made 
len ratingfive So amazing
len ratingone Seems like you can t setup multiple instances of the same application 
len ratingone Tried to do beta and alpha tests but spent way too much confusing time installing and reinstall after reinstall to have it be worth it 
len ratingone Needs improvement
len ratingone Why are you even asking me 
len ratingone Just make good tools and listen to developers please 
len ratingfive You know why I m here
len ratingfive  Please
len ratingfive We have been using test flight for a long time now and it s great 
len ratingfive Best way our company can test out app new additions 
len ratingfive Best thing we have added to our tech arsenal 
len ratingfive Greatest browser I ever used
len ratingfour Works great for reminders but wish it had a small calendar so a task would show up and remind you past the two weeks 
len ratingfour Do not need hours etc 
len ratingfour just something to show a task coming up 
len ratingfive Hey bro ya buddy buddy bro buddy ya bro ya buddy buddy thanks bro buddy bro ya ya bro buddy bro thanks bro ya buddy ya bro buddy ya buddy bro bro buddy thanks buddy bro ya bro buddy bro ya thanks bro ya ya bro ya buddy bro ya buddy ya buddy bro buddy ya buddy bro ya
len ratingone I was trying to write a review of a app I was testing 
len ratingone You prompted me to write a review in the process 
len ratingone Because the keyboard was open and didn t close I had no way to escape your prompt 
len ratingone I like the app I m testing and I kinda wonder why you need a review it s not like you need to rank higher in the App Store 
len ratingone Seems like a pointless inconvenience my ideal app testing app would be subtle and not buggier then the app I m testing
len ratingfive I am Beta testing this add and it s a great way to relax I highly recommend this app along with the other apps from this Developer 
len ratingfive I use Relax Meditations everyday and benefit from its sounds and guidance 
len ratingfive This game is entertaining for children and adults 
len ratingfive Easy to play while you re waiting at an appointment or just want to beat your last score

len ratingthree Plus working part time 
len ratingthree It seems the meditation would work best for me in evening but for some reason I just take the p m time to chill out or watch tv 
len ratingthree I will keep trying 
len ratingthree It s a routine changing thing 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate and definitely helps with trouble shooting apps before new releases are put out 
len ratingfive Best of the best
len ratingfive Excellent useful app 
len ratingfive Great job
len ratingfive Get this app hopefully this is the first review
len ratingone I get constant requests to re enter my password in my phone screen because of this app
len ratingfive I increased my income when I started using Ostazz also my professional profile gets updated 
len ratingone Not sure what email you sent the code to annoyed 
len ratingone It does work on iPads 
len ratingone On my phone it is fine 
len ratingthree Really need a contact combine consolidation tool for imported contacts from multiple databases and other contact apps
len ratingfive I love having the opportunity to test out new releases of software applications that I use on a daily basis 
len ratingfive TestFlight provides me with easy way to quickly install updates of pre release software 
len ratingfive like most Google products they are easy to use and get better with time 
len ratingfive user inputs continue to expand the knowledge base and provide insights 
len ratingfive this is one of my go to apps for information and exploring

len ratingfive Very helpful testing apps
len ratingone The title says it all 
len ratingone I Ay have been given a code at some point but don t have it now
len ratingfive I liked a lot very well app
len ratingfive This app is amazing 
len ratingfive May be one of the best social platforms to hit the web since Facebook 
len ratingfive This app has completely changed the way we do things with our aircraft 
len ratingfive We used to log numbers down in a notebook and reconcile them at the end of the month and any observations would require logging and a separate email to notify my partners 
len ratingfive And then tracking all of those things 
len ratingfive This app makes all of that so easy it is a pleasure 
len ratingfive I can t imagine going back to a paper log 
len ratingone How 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone Gasp 
len ratingfive Very Creative and new haven t seen an app like it before keep impressing us and making our workouts sooo much easier 
len ratingone  I mean seriously why do they have to make us enter a code 
len ratingone I ve been guessing codes looking all over this room for words 
len ratingone  Uhhhh Hey Siri 
len ratingone End Message 
len ratingone Oh wait Uhhhhh Bye 
len ratingthree For some time app does not open and says try again 
len ratingthree Well still same when tap try again

len ratingfive Great tool for keeping my OpusOne app up to date as testing is being done
len ratingone  Open button didn t update to Update even though new build existed in Previous Builds section 
len ratingone App is failing to download 
len ratingone Why is there nagware asking me to rate 
len ratingone This app is owned by apple 
len ratingone Every time I use this app it asks me for a rating 
len ratingone So I have given it a rating 
len ratingone Other than the aggressive prompts for ratings I have no problem with the app 
len ratingone Not worth it
len ratingone I was on Vigo Video and was told I was selected to be a beta tester so I was like cool 
len ratingone I downloaded the app accepted the policy and then I did not got my a invitation code so I could not even judge it if it was good or bad
len ratingfive Following instructions was easy 
len ratingone This is really bad I have no idea why the code will not accept 
len ratingone Going to delete app and forget about the whole thing 
len ratingone Keeps asking me to rate the app until I do 
len ratingfour The app is off to a great start 
len ratingfour It captures a lot of data and is something needed for public safety 
len ratingfour More features are needed but it is going in the right direction 
len ratingfive Thanks for staying up on updates 
len ratingfive If you re a Franklin Covey disciple this is the finest planner available 
len ratingfive If your not it still is 
len ratingfive Love this App

len ratingthree I just want to try it out for a bit 
len ratingfive The app works great so far 
len ratingfive Will have to continue to use to see if it can be better 
len ratingfour The new version is nice but the VPN slows down the browsing process significantly 
len ratingfour I ve had other VPNs but the one with this system needs to be fixed 
len ratingfive  Hanker
len ratingone Not working won t let me get code or put anything in please help me
len ratingone When the version expires why can t it automatically go to the AppStore with button 
len ratingone Why do I have to search for updates 
len ratingone Other apps that need updates can automatically go right to their app page to update 
len ratingtwo Can t request another redeem code 
len ratingfive This is an amazing way to get the bids done and move on with my day 
len ratingfive The created is genius 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingfive This app rocks 
len ratingthree I would really appreciate a search option 
len ratingfour  Honestly its good but nothing new 
len ratingfour I don t like sound effects racing with other opponents its little annoying racing with others like that 
len ratingfour If they were visible in the same screen maybe the experience would be different 
len ratingfour But over all stars 
len ratingfour Let s me know right away when there is a breach or something is wrong 
len ratingfour Gives me confidence my phone is secure even when on public wi fi 
len ratingfour User friendly 
len ratingfour Clear 
len ratingfour Better than other mobile security apps I ve tried 
len ratingfour Highly recommended 
len ratingfive Great app everything running smoothly
len ratingfive I never got one why 
len ratingone Tapped Redeem with no number available could go no further 
len ratingone LOOKOUT wanted me to Evaluate their new Beta version 
len ratingone Fat Chance 
len ratingfive My mother is year old Type on pump She battle each day low an while she sleep Thank you for the Spike app it has helped mom a lot with her alerts Thank you Michael Stone a Spike user as well 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive Keeps getting better 
len ratingone Shouldn t have to redeem a code every time app updates 
len ratingone If that be the case send the new code in the email with the update 
len ratingone I have had difficulties accessing our app in TestFlight 
len ratingone It seems quite complicated getting it setup 
len ratingone Perhaps it is just me as a rookie Apple app user acceptance tester 
len ratingtwo I like the last edition much better 
len ratingfive I like the way collecting personal details 
len ratingfive Very friendly and simple to update
len ratingone WHERE DO YOU WT UR CODE
len ratingfive  This gives new meaning to the phrase chasing butterflies 
len ratingfive Educational too because each time you capture one you are given its names both common and scientific 
len ratingfive Lovely game wonderful environment setting too 
len ratingfive Whoever created this needs an all expense paid trip to disney world 
len ratingfive I feel safer knowing there is an extra layer of protection on my phone when using either at home or in public 
len ratingfive Kudos to the creators 
len ratingfive Seems to work just fine 
len ratingfive I wish you could send invitation emails to emails other than Apple ID since those emails tend to be old and not visited often
len ratingthree I like the new format with the hour day radar 
len ratingthree Love all the new layers for the radar 
len ratingthree I really like the lightning alert to get the family out of the water 
len ratingthree I really miss the easy to read daily summary with the high low temp and forecast icon that slid right or left for days 
len ratingthree Bring it back please 
len ratingfive What a great app 
len ratingfive It s so easy to update my beta apps
len ratingone I received and invite for testing on Facebook Beta 
len ratingone I opened and it will not allow to load the app or the permission has been revoked 
len ratingone Why do they want me to test something that they won t let me test 
len ratingfive  I got an alert on my phone that rain showers were due in minutes and they arrived right on schedule 
len ratingfive I ve never had an app do that before 
len ratingfive How to receive an test flight invitation code
len ratingone Keep getting error messages and saying my invite is invalid 
len ratingone  The test app should be able to be a separate app on my device 
len ratingone The test app should not overwrite the established app but instead be it s own test app 
len ratingone This is insanely annoying and completely unnecessary especially on games where I have to lose what I have to test and release a simple update 
len ratingone Test app and real app should be able to be different entities on my device so I can test new software while still being able to see what users are experiencing on the old software 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed immediately 
len ratingone Thank you 
len ratingtwo I do not like that the VPN constantly comes on even when you turn it off 
len ratingtwo Sites that I have always gone on now takes forever to get on even if it allows me 
len ratingtwo I feel that if I turn the VPN off it should stay off 
len ratingtwo If problem is not corrected I ll just delete the app
len ratingone Why are you asking me to rate TestFlight 
len ratingfive There is an overall improvement from what you started with 
len ratingfive It s no STORMZ 
len ratingfive But it ll work 
len ratingfive Since you forced us by making it the only option

len ratingfive Weev Your Story too the Top
len ratingfive This a great app
len ratingfive Best tool to setup testing
len ratingfive Not sure where TestFlight starts and stops as to responsibility or how to reach them
len ratingone Installed the app they ask for some kind of code or secret word to load 
len ratingone Problem is they failed to send the code 
len ratingone Waste of my time yours if you try this 
len ratingtwo Where can I redeem the code from 
len ratingtwo No email or text was sent to me to key in the code
len ratingfive Brilliant idea 
len ratingfive Easy and fast

len ratingtwo Two stars for making me write a review of an app that I have no choice but to use 
len ratingfive Very cool concept and extremely user friendly 
len ratingfive Great app really cuts down my time in grabbing a lunch date and deciding where to go 
len ratingfive  I ve been working with Elevate since its early iterations and I think it s the best brain training app out there 
len ratingfive Developers have responded well to ideas to improve it even taking to heart the tiniest changes 
len ratingfive It s fun you can skip games training sections if you want with few hassles 
len ratingfive Challenging too at low higher levels 
len ratingfive Give it a try 
len ratingone I have been unable to obtain a code 
len ratingone Therefore I cannot use the app 
len ratingfive  The ability to see birds like on screen is amazing 
len ratingfive Track log to record all my flights and the new ability to save modes is extremely useful 
len ratingfive Seems to install beta test software well and monitor it 
len ratingfive Allows you to download beta versions of stuff 
len ratingone Never alerts me that I have a call 
len ratingone I have lost my spot on GEICO calls and cost me lots of money Never get tips because I m late This app is awful 
len ratingfive I hope i was using the app correctly 
len ratingfive Wow it really works well 
len ratingfive I just wish I had more apps to test 
len ratingfive Really 
len ratingfive I can t 
len ratingfive It s a museum now 
len ratingone Been waiting FOUR DAYS for TestFlight to forward an Invitation e mail with Activation Code 
len ratingone  It s actually pretty good
len ratingone The app won t open and crashes every time I try to open it 
len ratingone It says to check my internet connection which I know to be running fine 
len ratingone The app worked once and hasn t opened since 
len ratingone It s the only weather app I use
len ratingfive The ability to quickly toggle between radar daily etc 
len ratingfive is long overdue 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Good one
len ratingone Never received a code to redeem via email to launch app 
len ratingone Tried to uninstall and reinstall and still no code 
len ratingfive The reaction I got from my cofounder when he installed our app for the first time was priceless 
len ratingfive What an awesome app can t wait to see it in full strength 
len ratingone Internal testers don t get email notifications
len ratingfive  What a great concept to help struggling homeowners identifying the best bank they should be working with while saving them tens of thousands of dollars over the years to come by allowing them to take advantage of better rates they never knew existed
len ratingfive Simplifies the testing of iOS apps it s been great to use 
len ratingfive This app has changed the way we manage training records on our Fire department 
len ratingfive Not only has it saved us hours and hours of data entry but it has simplified our entire process 
len ratingfive On top of that it is fun to use 
len ratingone This app store seems to only have the buggiest and most broken versions of apps 
len ratingone Save yourself some headache and get the versions from the regular app store 
len ratingfour Hi I m enjoying the new features 
len ratingfour I m on an older ios device that is current on its software but I ve been experiencing issues with my browsing through google the device freezes and has to be powered down 
len ratingfour Only complaint is that the only way to clear the log is to close and re open the app and then re establish connection and reset my communication parameters 
len ratingfour Would be nice to have an easier way to separate my separate logs for separate tests
len ratingfive  I enjoy seeing immediately how well I am doing with my weight loss program 
len ratingfive This App warns you when you are doing well and when you need to improve 
len ratingfive Love it

len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive Darrell DarrellCraigHarris dot com
len ratingfive Real time notification of public safety incidents 
len ratingfive So useful 
len ratingone Seems Vera ability to work well with Vistacam camera has erodes and support by Vera likewise eroded 
len ratingone Email is not sent 
len ratingfive Best controller out there
len ratingfive  Test Flight is really a great app for developers
len ratingone Downloaded this app to hopefully start beta testing apps from developers yet you NEED a redeemable code to even get started 
len ratingone Saw the connect app which roughly says you can connect with devs for this app 
len ratingone Tried signing in that app tells me incorrect login password then says something about contact your team to set up an account um what 
len ratingone How do you contact devs if you can t contact devs to get a code to use THIS app 
len ratingfive  With great power comes great responsibility Knowledge is incredible power used irreverently it can destroy 
len ratingfive Used prematurely it can go wrong in many ways 
len ratingfive As an absolute beginner I have the feeling that I should take the learning process slowly and mostly just observe 
len ratingfive Thank you for a wonderful and terrible tool 
len ratingone The TestFlight app isn t too bad but to configure iTunes Connect to implement it correctly is a nightmare that is terrible unintuitive and not well documented or explained 
len ratingone The names for types of users makes zero sense 
len ratingfive Excellent
len ratingfive Great opportunity to see what it takes to get things up and running correctly 
len ratingfive I enjoyed giving feed back when needed 
len ratingfive I was sorry when it all ended 
len ratingfive Direct now is fantastic 
len ratingfive Thanks Again Michael Giannone
len ratingfive This is the most easy software to use that came out for iOS development 
len ratingfive Love using Leo AR and all the cool realistic objects in my surrounding 
len ratingtwo Not sure about this saw no difference then on food selections I can t choose anything that comes up first 
len ratingtwo Usually the item I want 
len ratingtwo Hmm 
len ratingtwo Won t update 
len ratingtwo Not so great 
len ratingone Despite removing and reading my Apple ID from the list of testers for an app I am not able to receive an email with the redemption code and thus cannot log in 
len ratingfive  This app is great for people who don t have time to set up their own workouts 
len ratingfive Your workouts are custom made to fit your needs and adjusts as you lift 
len ratingfive I ve never seen as much progress nor enjoyed the gym more because of this app 
len ratingfive Thanks 
len ratingfive Nice app 
len ratingfive  I love love love the Wordpress ios app 
len ratingfive I ve been a beta tester for a few years now and that experience is so worth it too 
len ratingfive They have an open platform for beta testing so anyone interested can participate 
len ratingfive By doing so you get access to the latest features which never fail to be AMAZING 
len ratingfive I ve used several other site building apps and none can hold a candle to the WordPress one 
len ratingfive You can do almost everything that you could using a desktop and browser based editor which is truly miraculous I think 
len ratingfive Keep up the good work WordPress and thanks for the steady stream of new features 
len ratingthree I m confused the age says but you can t get in unless you re 
len ratingthree What 
len ratingfive  So helpful and just what I needed to not only get myself into a healthier lifestyle but it gives me ways to help others too 
len ratingfive I especially like the community on the app 
len ratingfive So many people sharing articles and helpful tips 
len ratingfive Great 
len ratingfive Test Flight is by far the best and most user friendly GPS mapping program ever 
len ratingfive I m in the mountains of Puerto Rico repairing houses all over the island and without the the aid of this program I would lose countless hours looking for these properties 
len ratingfive Love this new mindfulness app 
len ratingfive It keeps getting better

len ratingone I wish you had left the old one alone
len ratingfive using it for years now 
len ratingfive flawless

len ratingfive This app is so incredible and futuristic 
len ratingone Please allow auto update
len ratingfive  I ve been able to keep up with my family and know they are okay whenever I open the app 
len ratingfive It s the best app I own 
len ratingfour Great tool I would have gone stars but i really wish there was a versioning tool to cross reference past changes 
len ratingfour Great tool for testing and working with both clients and remote team members 
len ratingfour We use it in all our mobile dev 
len ratingfive This app is easy to get all the builds within the native apps I love it 
len ratingfive This really helped when I did not know where to go for a recipe 
len ratingfive Works 
len ratingfive That s it 
len ratingfive Works great
len ratingfive Great app
len ratingtwo It crashes every time I try to redeem my code and I haven t been able to test my app it s been two days already 
len ratingfive Fun and challenging for all ages
len ratingfive It just works 
len ratingone So I get on here to do this beta test and it takes me past step and won t redeem the code 
len ratingone Absolute waste of my time 
len ratingone Thanks for the tease

len ratingfive My warmest thanks to co workers content contributors testers and supportive friends for their willingness to be pioneers 
len ratingfive Michael
len ratingfive Got the beta and was able to reset service indicator 
len ratingfive Thanks Carista 
len ratingone Haven t received a code yet to get started
len ratingthree TestFlight is a simple yet effective application for those who like to use their iDevice as a testing ground for a beta application 
len ratingone  you d think they d include it in every email prompt to update 
len ratingone I ve been beta testing Sports Alerts great app BTW for probably a couple years out of the goodness of my heart thanks to no rewards from TestFlight 
len ratingfive Can t find destination option n instant pay option too 
len ratingfive  This app works smoothly and plays a good game 
len ratingfive So handy to have in waiting rooms while waiting for a movie to start or when you need something to do 
len ratingfive Love it 
len ratingfive TestFlight is amazing 
len ratingfive I just wish I was authorized to test more apps 
len ratingone  I did not get an email
len ratingfive  I use for tracking my child and I like this app 
len ratingfive The month cost is low and great customer services thanks
len ratingone I can t resend an invitation code 
len ratingone It wouldn t even let me type in my email 
len ratingone I get tot the same page to redeem a code every time I redownload it
len ratingfive Hands down this is the best calendar task event app 
len ratingfive Don t cheap out 
len ratingfive This baby is worth every penny 
len ratingfive Pair it with Fastlane and it s a pretty good workflow 
len ratingfive Excelente aplicaci n fue de gran ayuda
len ratingfive  This app has more than just water sounds 
len ratingfive Some people are annoyed by them 
len ratingfive They have birds and wind chimes and all kinds of different sounds 
len ratingfive Check it out 
len ratingfive It s free to start and there are a lot of good free ones 
len ratingfive Greatest stickers ever 
len ratingfive Great app fellas 
len ratingfive I like how easy it is to use 
len ratingfive Easy to navigate I can quickly search for units and species 
len ratingfive Thank you for the opportunity to have a preview 
len ratingfive Keep up the great work 
len ratingfive it does what it supposed to do
len ratingone Not sending notification or email to the testers most of the time
len ratingfive I am using this app for last one year 
len ratingfive It s an excellent app 
len ratingfive I ve been truly great full and pleased with Carista for addressing the customization features missing for my BMW ix 
len ratingfive The breadth and depth of customizations they have uncovered for this model is nothing short of remarkable 
len ratingfive One customization feature I did not see and would like added if possible is having the side maker lights on visible when the parking and headlights are on and still blink with the turn signals 
len ratingfive Thanks Again 
len ratingone Way too complicated to add users 
len ratingone Half of those we wish to beta test can never figure it out the redeem code is nowhere to be found and Apps cannot be found often 
len ratingone Your security prevents this from being a usable tool
len ratingfive Thanks I was waiting for this now just Juno app 
len ratingtwo I don t like that everyone I look at says they are mikes away 
len ratingtwo Shouldn t it detect your location or give you some search perimeters 
len ratingfive Absolutely the best Destiny gear manager available 
len ratingfive Tough and challenging 
len ratingfive Needed a few rounds of play to become proficient 
len ratingfive Check the wind direction and speed it makes a big difference 
len ratingfive Working out is much more effective when you have a plan 
len ratingfive This app ensures I have a quality workout every time 
len ratingfive I ve always been someone who had dictated everything because it was faster 
len ratingfive And while I can still speak faster this app allows me to type at much quicker speeds 
len ratingfive They are constantly updating and improving which is a great sign 
len ratingfive I really enjoy it 
len ratingfive This is the best app for teaching Spanish 
len ratingfive Am enjoying the learning process 
len ratingfive  Talk about setting a goal and then achieving it 
len ratingfive This app is phenomenal 
len ratingfive Every week I set a goal and logged my activities through the app 
len ratingfive I felt better every time I hit my goal for the week 
len ratingfive The best part was that as soon as I accomplished my challenging goal for the week another week was starting the next day 
len ratingfive No slacking off for me 
len ratingfive Please tell my redeem code
len ratingfive I will not be without this program 
len ratingfive I m a senior reaping the benefits 
len ratingfive Love love love 
len ratingfive I always know where my kids are
len ratingfive This app is awesome 
len ratingfive  This ski app is the best one on the market

len ratingfive It breaks your stats down to each run gives a daily recap of all ski stats and complies your year to date accomplishments 
len ratingfive JUST AWESOME 
len ratingfive What a terrific site 
len ratingfive I started using Sigmal a few months ago And I don t candy coat anything I m up front and honest 
len ratingfive This app gives me security 
len ratingfive I love that 
len ratingfive Signal is the only way to go 
len ratingfive  One of a kind and absolutely superior in Catholic content Awesome apostolic work 
len ratingfive Thank you so much for adding all of those Opus Sanctorum Angelorum materials Work of the Holy Angels 
len ratingfive The audio touch is a super way to keep one motivated to pray when waning begins 
len ratingfive May God reward you 
len ratingfive This app is amazing I love it because it will help you become better at everything during your workouts
len ratingfive  I want this for both of my cars as a permanently installed system 
len ratingfive It should be completely separate from my phone 
len ratingfive A video I ll 
len ratingfive of the street road or highway could be simultaneously linked so that the destination would match with the Video 
len ratingone One star for app review request spam
len ratingfive One of the best best things Apple has ever done 
len ratingfive Testing apps is much easier 
len ratingfive I love playing sky light awaits I have never had a problem w test flight
len ratingfive I like the game it s fun shootings 
len ratingfive Graphics are cool And it s actually entertaining because it s challenging
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive I m able to watch her classes on the go and that is perfect for my world
len ratingone Played at my nieces home with her WiFi now home with my WiFi and The program won t load
len ratingfive So easy to use great to have at my fingertips thoughtful for whole meal planning and people on the go 
len ratingfive TestFlight has been amazing for me 
len ratingfive I have been working with a development team overseas and this platform has provided everything I need to test and give feedback for the mobile application 
len ratingfive No issues on my end 
len ratingfour While it isn t as convenient as the old TestFlight before the company was bought by Apple it is still very convenient 
len ratingfour I like how much information about the build is included and users receiving push notifications when builds finish processing 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive Feel much safer 
len ratingone When the developer push an update I get the email notification about the update but app never updates 
len ratingfour  Keep it up
len ratingfour Distributing apps for beta testing is so much better than the early days of iOS development 
len ratingfour So glad that Apple continues to improve this process 
len ratingfour Dear Apple if you are reading this please please please allow me to sign into TestFlight with a different account than my iTunes store account please 
len ratingfive Great app 
len ratingfive Easy to use and navigate
len ratingfive Tried all the other wx planning apps this blows them away 
len ratingfive Amazing
len ratingone Lame updates clearly trying to use new features as entry drug hoping you can t do without them in future at which time they will begin to convert to a subscription 
len ratingone This is similar to what they do with their Premium Service now 
len ratingone LinkedIn has cranked up the price for Premium which is no longer worth it 
len ratingone I would recommend to all users to cancel all subscriptions to LinkedIn until they realize what their services are actually worth let market forces guide them to proper price points 
len ratingone This app kept annoying me to give it a rating 
len ratingone Three times within seconds of me dismissing the pop up 
len ratingone Enjoy the one star rating 
len ratingone You earned it 
len ratingfive If there were a button to touch that would take me right to my favorites it would be super
len ratingfive Data is more concentrated on interest that affect me more informative than previous 
len ratingfive Time well spent
len ratingfive Works as advertised 
len ratingthree It may be working or it may not be working 
len ratingthree Especially on SPAM Text messages 
len ratingthree They keep rolling in 
len ratingfour In the tvOS version sometimes the app icon will indicate there s an update with the cloud icon but lately there isn t one 
len ratingfour You have to look inside the app icon 
len ratingfour Also if you beta test more than one app you often lose the ability to menu out to the main page where all the app icons are 
len ratingfour Instead you menu out of the whole TestFlight app 
len ratingfour Other than that wonky functionality the app concept is excellent 
len ratingthree The premise of this app is to allow testing AND feedback to go to developers 
len ratingthree So why is it that closed lists that accept comments only from a limited number of people are acceptable 
len ratingthree Seems to defeat the point 
len ratingthree Otherwise it s a good way to field test apps 
len ratingfive This s the most important it keeps track of all My things to do So you have to check them of the list And it keeps a record of them 
len ratingfive Thanks Apple for this awesome app Love 
len ratingfive The app is rock solid 
len ratingfive  Where is my code to rendem
len ratingfive I drink so much more using this bottle and app and really feel more energetic 
len ratingfive I love it 
len ratingfive It s been life changing 
len ratingthree TestFlight setup is a nightmare supposedly to provide security 
len ratingthree After the setup it works just fine 
len ratingfive  Works awesome
len ratingthree I usually don t like this because it turns off 
len ratingthree But this one stays on why I m driving and I constantly do not have to turn it back on 
len ratingone I don t want to have to click on update every time
len ratingthree It has everything but iOS players they should add it for people who doesn t have a pc or a Xbox or a ps over all it s a great use
len ratingfive Just launched App in Test Flight 
len ratingfive A bit difficult to get started in iTunes connect but once that hurdle is crossed it s great 
len ratingfive The app improvements have made it a great tool on the go 
len ratingfive I highly recommend it to pros and enthusiasts alike 
len ratingfour Well I can say the app is always improving When I drive though the GOad still doesn t pop to the address and when I work it through the app it doesn t allow me to see other possible routes 
len ratingfour I wish there was away to turn off Lyft share line 
len ratingfour During rush hour 
len ratingfour The rate is cute most times the distant long and the is less because of traffic 
len ratingfour Some times when I start really early 
len ratingfour I find the range of ride more than a few miles away If I decline my acceptance rate goes down and if I accept often times it is a short ride making it not worth doing 
len ratingfour Please narrow the ride 
len ratingfour Lastly The prime time is never in the valley like st Studio city and burbank never gave high rates
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive  Good
len ratingfive App in the galaxy
len ratingfive It s really helpful to have a record of progress 
len ratingfive  Great app for beta testing 
len ratingfive So fast for loan
len ratingfive Just that 
len ratingfive Simple easy best way to manage apps that are being tested 
len ratingfive It would be super cool if there were a way to explore apps that developers have made available for testing 
len ratingfive What a great App 
len ratingfive Simple easy and effective 
len ratingfive This does make a positive difference in the day 
len ratingfive Can bring animation to my pictures with interesting live backgrounds 
len ratingfive Also can take videos of what I see in the app 
len ratingfive If you are a developer or in a beta testing crew you must have this app 
len ratingfive It works flawlessly and is easy to use 
len ratingfive Best app ever 
len ratingfive Thank you 
len ratingfive Awesome app acts as a conduit to install beta apps via your Apple ID 
len ratingfive Great app it does exactly what it is made for 
len ratingfive Thank you Apple 
len ratingfive Love being part of group who could influence changes improvements 
len ratingfive I love it
len ratingfive I love this application makes very easy to create profile and it is very friendly 
len ratingfive I love this app 
len ratingfive I hate having to go to google to be able to use it 
len ratingfive Please please give me back my app for iPhone 
len ratingfive  If you fly often this app is as important as your toothbrush 
len ratingfive It picks up all your flight bookings automatically updates your calendar and the begins to prompt and assist you every step of the way 
len ratingfive Alerts appear when it s time to check in online time to check in physically and board and even when it s time for you to get up for a stretch during your flight 
len ratingfive Your terminal and gate details will always be updated automatically and in a pinch between terminals on transit and rushing to a connection having directional information always on hand is a lifesaver 
len ratingfive It night be an expensive subscription but more specifically useful than FlightRadar for your actual travel 
len ratingfive I need it
len ratingfour Every time it needs to update it blocks me out and it is kind of difficult to update because it s not through the App Store and the test flight is telling me I m kicked out so I have to look for my old email for a code i know this is apart of the test thing though but a bit frustrating at times 
len ratingfive  I ve had plenty of crew apps and nothing comes close to this 
len ratingfive The apps owner replies immediately to questions or requests and makes app adjustments almost on a daily basis 
len ratingfive Can t give it enough stars 
len ratingfive Great app to view real time bitcoin and FX rates
len ratingfive This is a great way for company s to get feedback on how to make a product or service better 
len ratingfive I get paid a handsome wage for what I do with the application 
len ratingfive That be said look your best with that thinking cap and tell the developers what you want 
len ratingfive Then they give you what is best Then you become a developer
len ratingone I never got my in invitation code 
len ratingfive I had previously rated this app low 
len ratingfive It has since had some very good improvements 
len ratingfive It has worked flawlessly with an app I have been testing in recent months 
len ratingfive Best app ever
len ratingfive Easy to learn and fun to master 
len ratingthree i get to test features for other people for free 
len ratingthree i dont like renewing my apps every day though 
len ratingfive Love the fact that they keep adding new features like reusing postcards and now the ability to personalize your messages when sending to multiple people
len ratingfive This game is a blast 
len ratingfive Love the app 
len ratingfive It make golf game more enjoyable 
len ratingone This is a joke 
len ratingone Fail 
len ratingfive  I can t overstate the effectiveness of this app 
len ratingfive The workouts are well thought out and target muscles that are often neglected in standard routines 
len ratingfive I ve been Shredding faithfully since September of and have seen incredible improvements in my strength flexibility endurance and muscle tone 
len ratingfive Perhaps the greatest part about Shred is that it allows you to tailer the workouts for your personal goals and with Adam as your trainer they will be attained 
len ratingfive I like the TestFlight app 
len ratingfive I am glad to be able to send reviews through the app 
len ratingfive This is a very education tool and it is fun 
len ratingfive What an amazing and unique way to share the word of God 
len ratingfive We are making good progress
len ratingfive  Anything in an hour really 
len ratingfive Genie in a bottle
len ratingfive I am a beta tester but it won t give me the code funimate please help 
len ratingone New version is horrible 
len ratingone Defeats the purpose of hinge vs other apps 
len ratingone Need the redeem code
len ratingfive Been working this app and the PalmAgent tech team to death 
len ratingfive Amarillo agents who have previewed the Beta app with me are now my biggest sales team 
len ratingfive yerp
len ratingfive Yeah 
len ratingfive I m sure it would help you 
len ratingfive For the most part this app makes it so easy to download the apps that we are beta testing without having to navigate developer sites to find them which can be daunting especially for those of us who are blind or have other disabilities that require the use of Voiceover 
len ratingfive That leads me to something else 
len ratingfive For everything that I have used it for redeeming invite codes and download for new builds of apps in progress it seems to be completely accessible 
len ratingfive Such amazing app 
len ratingfive  Then this app is for you 
len ratingfive I ve been using for almost two years and it is great 
len ratingfive Tracks work sleep commute every activity 
len ratingfive And it has really helped me tweak my lifestyle 
len ratingfive Reports by day week month and year 
len ratingfive By time spent on activities or location 
len ratingfive Worth it 
len ratingfive Keep going good job would b nice if you could make dealer pacific 
len ratingfive ShopLook is busting their tails to provide a platform for Polyvore expats as well as all designers and shoppers 
len ratingfive Stay tuned 
len ratingfive Exactly what I needed to keep track of my puppy s habits 
len ratingtwo I ve been playing the beta test for more than a year 
len ratingtwo It s gotten a little better in the map department 
len ratingtwo But not much else 
len ratingtwo As of right now I cannot even load my hangar 
len ratingtwo I get an empty hangar and can t do anything with it 
len ratingtwo I m not that excited about this battling robot game 
len ratingtwo When it was working the bots still seemed herky jerky and hard to control 
len ratingtwo The menu is rather ambiguous with regard to loading weapons etc 
len ratingone This app is so unreliable 
len ratingone I have three iOS devices and only one of them is prompted to download the beta invite 
len ratingone This is the worst 
len ratingone Add a search
len ratingfive Easy to use 
len ratingfive No issues
len ratingfour Test 
len ratingone Pon todo una disco en tu casa en tu patio iluminaci n l ser M quinas de humo pantalla gigante sonido la mejor m sica de ho y de ayer show en vivo etc
len ratingfive Good job
len ratingfour Great app that keeps improving
len ratingthree Unlike when you use this on an iPad you can t load previous builds on iPhone during testing 
len ratingthree That would be nice

len ratingthree I wish you could search for apps seeking testers For the dev s Perhaps with privacy modes like show notice we re seeking beta testers to Any Previous users of app Previous users of any company app with written request reason s Required opt setting setable on any of those For end users a search and the availability for emailing at least any purchased app which actively uses testflight if they don t try to advertise 
len ratingthree Built in forums for feedback and user to user communitys 
len ratingthree I would test apps all the time like I have on my PC 
len ratingthree I paid for the Windows NT Preview program and received regular internal builds on disk back in 
len ratingthree I recall making contacts I m still in touch with because I discovered fixes for errors not on Google and shared 
len ratingthree Hard to find on search bar 
len ratingthree Must have exact words for some
len ratingfive  I ve tested four apps so far three of which have finally dropped out of beta and gone on to production 
len ratingfive  And one of which I finally decided I no longer need 
len ratingfive It has been a special pleasure to see the bugs fixes and new features in advance 
len ratingfive And to get an idea of how developers work 
len ratingfive Please Give me redeem code
len ratingfive This game grabs you into it 
len ratingfive Once you start you can t stop 
len ratingfive I play it everyday 
len ratingfive I recommend it 
len ratingfive  This is a very well designed camera 
len ratingfive It easily accommodates itself to your network when your perform a first time install 
len ratingfive It recovers nicely from an occasional loss of wi fi 
len ratingfive When your network recovers and your Wi Fi signal is present the camera will find and restore itself to your network 
len ratingfive When this model is offered for purchase I will definitely acquire two or more to add to my network 
len ratingfive MAS AI
len ratingfive I need code 
len ratingone Huh that s just odd 
len ratingone I mean good for you supporting older firmwares 
len ratingone But you re always so proud of showing us that pie chart with OF IOS USERS ARE USING THE LATEST SOFTWARE 
len ratingone The only reason they are is because you re about as aggressive as Microsoft when it comes to updates 
len ratingone Guess what 
len ratingone Your updates brick as many phones as the forced windows update did 
len ratingone I mean God s sake don t auto download the software updates if we DON T WANT THEM 
len ratingfive Overall a very dependable and stable application 
len ratingfive Makes things easy 
len ratingone Why 
len ratingone  I downloaded this app because the app ulzi is going to be on here and i want it but I have to be 
len ratingone I will have to wait years to use this app Terrible service 
len ratingone Other users agree 
len ratingone Fix this now 
len ratingthree I ve seemed to hit a stopping point when I used my redeem code from the invitation I ve received to test out the beta version 
len ratingthree Is it possible from me to get a new code 
len ratingthree Thx
len ratingtwo I never got sent a code
len ratingone  So I put in my Apple ID me and I never got an email with the code but I really need it so please fix this issue apple
len ratingone This company is sending me emails with an unsubscribe link that sends me to another company s costumer service who can t do anything 
len ratingone They don t respond via twitter have no contact info online and the emails are no reply which leaves this as my only resource 
len ratingtwo Accidentally Skipped past the send redeem code through email page and when I got to the next page the enter redeem code page it won t let me go back to send a redeem code even when I uninstall the app 
len ratingtwo What do i do 
len ratingthree What is redeem codes 
len ratingone I can t even use Test Flight for the program I was selected for because the promo code that was given to me includes numbers but Test Flight only accepts letters 
len ratingone Completely useless 
len ratingone This is not letting me be a beta tester 
len ratingone It keeps going to lookout and will not give me premium security to test the new updates
len ratingthree Is there any way for beta testers to see feedback functionality in TestFlight 
len ratingone After restart testflight app the test app still in list even though I have pressed Stop testing 
len ratingfive I need a invite
len ratingthree I haven t received an e mail with my invite code any reason why 
len ratingthree I ve also checked my junk mail and nothing pops up 
len ratingthree I downloaded TestFlight beta testing app and it hasn t sent me a code to redeem 
len ratingthree I can t use it without the code 
len ratingthree First test I try take mins then send it back take me weeks still go through 
len ratingthree Am I lost those balances 
len ratingone I can t get in the app because it asks for a redeem code that was never sent to me I ll update my review once I get in This app seems awesome but without a redeem code I can t get in 
len ratingfour Code the invitation
len ratingone I was given an invite so I downloaded the app by I never got the code to start the beta app 
len ratingfive For i am testr will it fly like wet cement i love all my appll thankyu Clarrisa sox
len ratingone  I have not gotten an invite code How do you get one 
len ratingtwo It is very difficult to add beta testers through iTunes connect and the site is not mobile friendly at all 
len ratingtwo There needs to be an easier way to add them via email or cell number so they can quickly add our app for testing 
len ratingone The notification was a pop up whoever that s possible 
len ratingone I don t remember seeing a invitation code Or I need a new one 
len ratingone It s dumb
len ratingthree  May I m not sure erroneously show The developer removed you from testing 
len ratingthree I was removed from one but the dev said Oops not me Dev s fault 
len ratingthree Testflight s fault 
len ratingthree Pick 
len ratingthree At any rate note that having the Testflight version of an app makes it appear in the App Store as if you haven t downloaded the app which meaning it s hard to place reviews for the app 
len ratingthree It s a great life if you don t weaken but who the hell wants to be strong 
len ratingone I received an invitation and downloaded the app but never got a redemption code 
len ratingone I got an invite for this thing with no code so I m not sure how they want me to test this thing 
len ratingone I d be more than happy to if apple would send me the code
len ratingfive Donde est el c digo
len ratingone Never receive a invitation code what s up with this app 
len ratingone My code never worked so I can give a true rating 
len ratingone So I got the app because I went to the App Store and it asked me if I want to get it but when I got it I checked my Mail and I never got a invitation code to join
len ratingone Went on Instagram to be greeted with a message saying I could download this app and test Instagram only to find out you get no code and now I ve downloaded the app for no reason 
len ratingone I was asked to download this app to test and review 
len ratingone Upon following the instructions I could not locate the code to redeem so I cannot do so 
len ratingone I reached out to Apple support who sent me back to the download page and advised me to reach out to the developer who is Apple 
len ratingone Shenanigans 
len ratingone Can anyone help 
len ratingone I can t get a code
len ratingtwo I got a notification about this app and decided to install it 
len ratingtwo I agreed to the user agreement however I never got a redemption code 
len ratingtwo I m pretty sure this is my fault but I do not know if I can use the app anymore
len ratingone  Was on instagram and a popup came up telling me i have the chance to download this app i accepted and downloaded but was given no redeem code what do i do to receive one 
len ratingone I got a invitation to try TestFlight but I didn t get a redeem code 
len ratingfive How can I get a redeem code
len ratingfive Need a redeem code
len ratingone My new home address doesn t have internet and I must use cellular data 
len ratingone You even give us a warning that we might exceed our data but still let us click download as if we have an option 
len ratingone We don t 
len ratingone If it s over mb you are screwed unless you find Wi Fi 
len ratingone Not happy
len ratingone when i went onto the app it told to me to redeem a code but i never got a code could you contact me back with help 
len ratingone Was asked to join via notification but was never given a redemption code 
len ratingone Anyway that could have been an accident 
len ratingone I never received a redeem code to use the app like really
len ratingthree  So I was on Instagram and this test flight thing popped up asking if I wanted to be an Instagram beta tester I Got the app and after agreeing to the terms I asked for an invite code I went back to instagram and the popup was gone Can someone help me
len ratingthree  I opened my Instagram app and was greeted with a message asking if I wanted to try a new beta version of Instagram 
len ratingthree I attempted to say yes and was taken to the app store where it had me download testflight 
len ratingthree However after doing that I have not seen where I was supposed to get a code to use for it 
len ratingthree I m not sure what the deal is 
len ratingthree I ve checked my email and nothing 
len ratingone I was asked to be a beta tester and I downloaded the TestFlight app 
len ratingone I was asked to read the Terms contract but clicked accept before I could read it 
len ratingone I saw the email address it would send the email to before I clicked accept but I never received an email I ve looked up ways to fix this but so far I haven t had any luck 
len ratingone Any help 
len ratingfive I was sent a link on intragram to the beta download through a pop up and it said something about wanting to have me join the beta but I did not see a code and I cans find anything in the app or in my emails telling me about it
len ratingone I never got the email to start the app
len ratingtwo  I not once receive my TestFlight invite code sometime today 
len ratingone I was invited to test this app 
len ratingone I downloaded it but never got a code 
len ratingone What s up with that 
len ratingone I don t like it because it dosent let me change the email to send it too
len ratingone It says you have to be but on the thing it says and why thirteen I m going to have to wait for a couple months before I can test halbricks new game 
len ratingone please make it so that or maybe every one can use it or because it says 
len ratingfive It crashes when I m putting the redeem code to get the ark survival evolved beta
len ratingone I got this to test vine but it just crashes every time so I m deleting it 
len ratingfour I need a code pliss a company send me a code to play a beta about Ark and TestFlight ask me for a code
len ratingone I keep getting an error can not connect to iTunes connect This application is a farce how can it have apples name on it 
len ratingone It tends to break without telling you why 
len ratingone No indication whether it is their servers or your account certificates app fault
len ratingone Please fix bug 
len ratingone I ve had the error TestFlight couldn t connect to iTunes Connect 
len ratingone Please try again later for the last hours 
len ratingone The error is occurring across multiple devices 
len ratingone All new TestFlight email links are also timing out beta apple please fix 
len ratingone Received an email with code and accidentally deleted it 
len ratingone How can I have it re sent 
len ratingone For the last week or so me and everyone I know has had extremely slow download speeds from TestFlight 
len ratingone Used to be as fast as the App Store itself but now it takes like an hour to download a mb app 
len ratingone  invitation code 
len ratingthree How do I get a code it s not giving me one
len ratingone Having to sign in to Apple everytime is ridiculous 
len ratingone It s also interfering with payment for subscriptions 
len ratingone Worthless app 
len ratingtwo I accepted the terms and use but did not get a verification code
len ratingone Why does it say Age Requirement on the App Store page but when you need to open the app it doesn t let you in unless you are at least 
len ratingone If I could give this stars I would because i can t use the app 
len ratingone Fix this TestFlight 
len ratingone  Yo add me on Snapchat brb ethan
len ratingthree So I got to the next step and it said to type in a code 
len ratingthree I went to my email and I didn t see an email from TestFlight 
len ratingthree What do I do 
len ratingthree Is there a way you could resend it 
len ratingone  I loaded this app as required to do beta test it didn t work at all 
len ratingone I have one of the newest iPhones and tried adding the code I was given multiple times 
len ratingone I guess it gets me out of being the guinea pig 
len ratingone Sometimes something that doesn t work is a blessing in disguise
len ratingtwo  Apparently the app has bugs in push notifications it won t push notifications for every app I am testing
len ratingone  redeem 
len ratingfive  I Need To Be Added As A Test Flight Developer Could You Send Me A Code To JosephJohnson AT iCloud com

len ratingfive How do you get i new code I ve been looking everywhere Anyone know how to get a new one 
len ratingfive Need code
len ratingone I retrieved my new fort craft code and attempted to redeem the code which never worked 
len ratingone I tried for an hour and could never get it to work 
len ratingone Awful app 
len ratingone This app is giving me cancer
len ratingone It won t give me an invitation
len ratingfive  iphone 
len ratingthree The issue is with the redemption code when a user first downloads TestFlight it emails their Apple ID a code 
len ratingthree If they don t use it within hours it expires and there is NO WAY to send them another one so that beta user is dead 
len ratingthree Three calls into Apple have not found a support person who knows the first thing about this yet but will keep trying 
len ratingthree Funny they keep saying to call the app developer which is Apple Hope they improve because it is really useful 
len ratingone I was invited to test but even after I downloaded the app I couldn t 
len ratingone Very aggravated that I wasted my time on a lost cause 
len ratingone I SENT THE ACTIVATION CODE TO WHO KNOWS WHERE ACCIDENTALLY AND I NEVER GOT IT AND IT WONT LET ME RESEND THE CODE 
len ratingone I REINSTALLED THE APP AND I STILL CANT DO ANYTHING 
len ratingone LET ME RESEND THE CODE SO I CAN USE THE APP PLEASE 
len ratingone  February AM US central time Test flight has stopped sending me notifications for updates of EACH of two different apps which I am beta testing now 
len ratingone My settings for TestFlight notifications allow notifications send ALERTS which require user response before they will be dismissed so you CAN T miss them show notifications in lock screen AND notification center sounds turned on show badge app icon 
len ratingone In other words all options ON GREEN 
len ratingone None of those things happen 
len ratingone I simply have to open TestFlight before any use of either beta app to see if there s been an update 
len ratingone There have been such updates and again no notification whatsoever in at least the past few weeks at least three times 
len ratingone I discovered the first time by accident 
len ratingone I m not complaining about the app in general only noting that the notification functionality is not working for me right now 
len ratingone I ve informed both beta app developers but can t find any specific way to inform this app s developers Apple other than this rating 
len ratingone I am on the last iOS version before came out on an iPhone 
len ratingone This new directv now beta app is not working good 
len ratingone Too often I have to switch to the old app because it freezes 
len ratingone Why not improve on the old app 
len ratingone In the AppStore it says I m and when I used it the first time it said I have to be 
len ratingone Why is it like this 
len ratingfour  Not impressed
len ratingfour In general I like the game some nice aspects that is different to the normal strategy game 
len ratingfour Will keep on playing it 
len ratingtwo  First of all I am willing to admit this may be user error I have tried to contact Apple Support the call dropped while I was on hold because the battery on the portable phone died after being I have not heard back from Apple 
len ratingtwo I have both an iPhone SE an iPad mini 
len ratingtwo Both devices are running the current version of iOS the current version of TestFlight 
len ratingtwo The symptom is I am not able to subscribe feedback using TestFlight app on either device 
len ratingtwo It appears Apple advisors do not know how to handle calls about the TestFlight app as I was transferred several times during the call 
len ratingtwo Shortly before I was put on hold the final time the Apple advisor was looking at my devices 
len ratingtwo At this point I am still trying to contact the vendor for the app I am testing outside of the TestFlight app because there seems to be a problem with the app being tested on my iPhone SE 
len ratingtwo Yes I am frustrated 
len ratingtwo Please allow us to use other email clients 
len ratingtwo I use the Outlook app and it s frustrating that I have to have an email address in the default iPhone email app just to be able to send feedback 
len ratingfive  iOS 
len ratingfive It s a good app I was using this to beta test Snapchat s new redesign UI I have accidentally pressed stopped testing now I can t get back into it 
len ratingfive Is there another code I can use or someone can put me back in it 
len ratingfive Thank you
len ratingthree I clicked continue on accident now I cannot redeem my code 
len ratingfive This app is underrated but extremely useful for development and testing 
len ratingfive I can t see why it s not getting stars every time 
len ratingfive You can t really rate this app as it is a company that offers beta software from other companies so that customers can test out their providers software prior to its launch 
len ratingfive Very cool concept
len ratingfive Looks like a cool app
len ratingone the app does nothing and cannot even be used DO NOT INSTALL THIS 
len ratingtwo Where do I go to sign up for a code I d love to use this app for new games but I don t know where to go to get a invitation code please help me Thank you 
len ratingone  APP
len ratingone My fun ended quickly 
len ratingone  I almost started to cry it was no fun Why do you need an invitation to test 
len ratingone I feel like I will switch to Microsoft Windows 
len ratingone Sry Just too bad of an app for me even though I am 
len ratingone First I was like Hallelujah 
len ratingone  and then that is what happened 
len ratingone Ok so I saw this app it looked perfect so I download it and then I have trouble finding the code pls make it more specific every time I enter the code the app crashes so far I deleted times not working so I just deleted the app if u can update it and fix it pls do and I will be happy to try agian 
len ratingfive  Great app
len ratingone  tf 
len ratingfive Ive had this app for a while and use it for my small business 
len ratingfive Ive had a few bugs to work through but have always had great support from their team 
len ratingfive I love all the features and its very easy to set up 
len ratingfive I love having all the information on both my iPad and my iPhone 
len ratingfive Can t say enough good stuff on how they have always been available by email phone calls and texts to explain something when i have a question or problem 
len ratingfour Doing bata very easy no problems with down loads and notices 
len ratingtwo  what the hell 
len ratingone  V lznyj
len ratingone This App has never worked properly for me I am a QA engineer and every time a new application comes out for me a test through test flight I never get an invitation even though the backend is all set up properly 
len ratingone And any of my attempts to get support never get replies 
len ratingone I never get feedback or help so I have to go through a bunch of loopholes just to get the app on my device to do my job 
len ratingone But you know because it s Apple you re forced to go through this method so good luck 
len ratingfour  ios 
len ratingtwo I literally was just trying to beta test the new Dino Rush 
len ratingtwo Of course the app says I need to be 
len ratingtwo It s rated 
len ratingtwo I m and a half and I m slightly aggravated about this rule because now it won t let me in 
len ratingthree I started the app and stuff then it told me to put in a redeem code but I forgot to enter my email so I deleted it and reinstalled the app 
len ratingthree And it didn t let me enter my email after that so I kept doing that and it still didn t work 
len ratingthree Please tell me how to make it work I m sure it s a good and working app when it works 
len ratingone  APP 
len ratingfive  It s a good app for testing applications but if you make it internationally For example you can add Simplified Chinese I will like it much 
len ratingfive  iOS 
len ratingtwo  app 
len ratingtwo Every time I enter the redeem code the app closes
len ratingone  testflight 
len ratingone I am a person who is looking to find and also develop apps I heard of the TestFlight app and now I use it it takes too long to load the code all day I was waiting and I still have not received a code can I get some help 
len ratingone How do I obtain a code for test flight 
len ratingthree I have enjoyed being a Beta tester and TestFlight has always worked well for me until a few months ago 
len ratingthree Now it repeatedly requests my Apple password 
len ratingthree Even outside of this app 
len ratingthree It was so frustrating that I deleted the app I was Beta testing and reinstalled it as a regular app 
len ratingthree No problem 
len ratingthree Then as soon as TestFlight had an update and my app changed back to a Beta test the Apple password requests started again 
len ratingthree Ugh 
len ratingthree Please fix this 
len ratingone I would rate it higher but I couldn t provide my email 
len ratingone I really wanted to beta test stuff but i can t cause I didn t get the invitation code 
len ratingfive  QwQ 
len ratingone Asks for password when using the beta app 
len ratingone Very annoying and continues even after exiting app
len ratingone I need a redeem code and I do not know where to get it from 
len ratingfive  app mobo 
len ratingfive  o o
len ratingone  Redeem 
len ratingone I can t even get past that as never received a redemption code or can you not request one 
len ratingone According to the fine print if I allow Testflight I get the chance to run even pre alpha grade apps under design by Apple and third parties on the phone that s within of me 
len ratingone I have to open my phone to anyone in the app writing biz so they can monitor the next best thing since sliced bread with no promise my phone and I mean the phone part itself will not have its firmware turned into binary confetti until reprogrammed by an Apple tech with NO explicit promise damage will not be labelled misuse of product voiding warrantee 
len ratingone I also get nothing no discounts on new phones not even app credit or promise of a free copy pro testers earn or MORE for doing what s expected of me

len ratingtwo  ios 
len ratingone Used TestFlight to install the Beta Gmail and the Beta started to re download previously read and deleted mail from the linked account where it showed up in my iPhone email app 
len ratingone No way to unlink 
len ratingone Had to delete the Beta app and reinstall the normal Gmail app 
len ratingone No way to provide feedback from TestFlight it only allowed me to reinstall the Beta 
len ratingone Apple needs to focus a bit more on Watch 
len ratingone TestFlight lags in installing apps onto the Apple Watch 
len ratingone Restricting developers who create apps for Apple Watch
len ratingone I was sent the link to set up a beta trial but it would download on my iPhone 
len ratingone Then I tried to use it on my iPad both of which are updated to iOS but the app said my hardware was incompatible

len ratingtwo  ios ipad pro 
len ratingone I use TestFlight to try out beta applications 
len ratingone There is no support for getting in contact with someone to help with issues 
len ratingone I never received an invitation code and it keeps saying I redeemed it but never did 
len ratingone Can someone at Apple please step up and help with this problem 
len ratingone  MicrosoftEdge 
len ratingfive  vv vv 
len ratingone  Give me back wifi bt kill switch in iOS 
len ratingone This is a poor UX move 
len ratingone Make it right 
len ratingfive  winner winer chicken dinner
len ratingfive  Be nice if it showed available beta apps to test
len ratingfive  We tested a new application called Bond which converts a ceiling fan or air conditioning controller to a device that then connects to your phone and enables you to control your AC or ceiling fan from your phone 
len ratingfive What I like about the app is that I can use the different controls on the app to control the ceiling fan and for more complex fans there are more than speeds 
len ratingfive I recommend putting new batteries in your original remote control before connecting the Bond device because it synchronizes better for some reason 
len ratingfive Overall an interesting new app and cool to use 
len ratingone no code that works sketchy email 
len ratingone scrap
len ratingone I couldn t get the code at all it wasnt in my mail ether
len ratingfive How do the developers get it 
len ratingfour Apps I ve opted to stop testing are initially removed from my list of apps 
len ratingfour However when TestFlight restarts the old app reappears like a ghost of old apps past 
len ratingfive  Or any other app 
len ratingfive The last two prior updates the developers were gone 
len ratingfive  RdU
len ratingone My activation code has numbers in it 
len ratingone I am unable to activate my beta key
len ratingthree This app does not have current speed limits 
len ratingthree I follow the posted speed limits and still get an alert saying I was speeding when I wasn t 
len ratingthree Also I get alerts for phone handling after I have arrived at my destination and parked and while my phone is in the holder while I m driving 
len ratingthree If these get fixed the app would be even better 
len ratingthree One last thing the app doesn t always pick up my trips I drove miles one way and it was not tracked 
len ratingone I was sent an email to download TestFlight to try out Cosmos Duel 
len ratingone Downloaded fine until it asked me for the redemption code then it states the internal error unable to redeem code 
len ratingfive Simples e funcional 
len ratingfive this app is really fun to use and works great 
len ratingfive love it 
len ratingone  app 
len ratingtwo Trying to test Justice Royale but I don t get past the Zapling Studio screen 
len ratingtwo It just freezes there 
len ratingfive  txt uc 
len ratingfive  App installs looks beautiful and works just fine 
len ratingfive I like that you can track your daily steps and look at your step history whenever you d like 
len ratingfive  Installed works but the facial recognition has locked me out of my Beta iPhone Now I have to use wait 
len ratingfive Issue solved with hard reset 
len ratingfive Another Security Flaw 
len ratingfive Installing the app is quite simple and easy to navigate 
len ratingfour The Testflight and Apple email notifications for Testflight have stopped 
len ratingfour Other users are seeing the same 
len ratingfive  It is very easy to use 
len ratingone  CET 
len ratingone Installed the app successfully but testing site kept telling me to install prior to getting a redemption code 
len ratingone The one and only app that will not install on my iPhone s Plus

len ratingone I have tried at multiple points over the last day and it never works 
len ratingtwo DoeLmb

len ratingfive I was invited to do a beta test and it works perfectly through this app 
len ratingone  testflight flight
len ratingfive When I get to the create nickname screen it says special characters cannot be used no matter what I type in Never mind got it just had to close game and reopen now it works beautifully
len ratingone  I don t understand why you don t accept Minecraft Apple 
len ratingone It would be better if you did 
len ratingone Was a hassle to download and now the app won t even start 
len ratingone It s broken
len ratingone  When I get to the create nickname screen it says special characters cannot be used no matter what I type in
len ratingone I still haven t received my code

len ratingone So to test in app purchases I have to log in to my store account install the build from TestFlight log out of my store account start the game log in as a sandbox account test the game then log out of the sandbox account and back into my regular account when I m done testing 
len ratingone Apple please don t make everything such a pain in the rear
len ratingfive This app is so simple to use on the fly 
len ratingfive When you re pitching an idea over a cocktail napkin or in a conference room of prospective clients it has wow factor 
len ratingfive Can t wait for the next gen 
len ratingone I frequently get an error message that says TestFlight cannot be reached at this time 
len ratingone So far support has been unable to resolve the issue 
len ratingtwo  The app to be tested is either waiting or loading in TestFlight 
len ratingtwo Unable to download in China 
len ratingtwo Sigh Something wrong with the server 
len ratingtwo The downloading time is so long that many users just give up 
len ratingtwo Hope to improve our test experience and make a better version 
len ratingone No way to leave devs feedback 
len ratingone  I ve had this app for I don t know how long I am invited if I don t get invited by o clock today I m deleting it forever and cool whatever
len ratingone Open the app and I am presented with a view that says Could not load Apps 
len ratingone I have uninstalled and re installed and tried a reboot and nothing seems to remediate the issue 
len ratingone Beta apps should not need review the website is slow and unresponsive having to submit compliance AFTER the build processes after who knows how long 
len ratingone did anyone at Apple even use this before deploying it 
len ratingone  app transfer testflight bug 
len ratingone TestFlight just spammed all of our external beta testers with automated emails that a new version was ready to test it should have only generated the one email 
len ratingone Lots of annoyed testers and unsubscribes to process now 
len ratingthree  TestFlight is a important application for those who like to use their iDevice as a testing ground for an application 
len ratingone  bug 
len ratingfive  Got one of my favorite betas this way 
len ratingfive Had a feature I d been wanting a long time 
len ratingfive No looking back 
len ratingfive Superb 
len ratingfive  Except that I d prefer that the developers of that app pour their on edge efforts into the production level of the app 
len ratingfive For the app in question I ve never encountered a bug in the beta 
len ratingone My SiriusXM app use to be a pleasure to use 
len ratingone Now I want to cancel the service because I can t listen to anything properly 
len ratingone The delays are Horrendous and it doesn t skip forward or replay back without pressing the button multiple times 
len ratingone The worse part is it s been weeks and still no fix 
len ratingone After the latest update all of the apps I m beta testing disappeared and now I can t open any new builds or accept any invites 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed PRONTO Apple 
len ratingone Title says it all get it together Apple
len ratingone I gave up and deleted the app 
len ratingone Technology is more advanced than this wreck of an app 
len ratingone Good luck 
len ratingone My previous app I was testing are not visible anymore 
len ratingone I had to resend an invitation to start testing 
len ratingone And when I start a second app for testing with the same redemption it doesn t show up 
len ratingone Please fix it or give a better documentation of your functionality changes 
len ratingthree  app 
len ratingone Finally the April update installed today It has taken me trying multiple times over a seven day period to get this last update to install 
len ratingone Every time I tried the icon would just say Waiting 
len ratingone It wouldn t even delete 
len ratingone The latest update does not even open 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed 
len ratingone I deleted the app from my iPad and downloaded it again to see if it would fix the problem but it doesn t 
len ratingone Please fix 
len ratingone I can see the app I am beta testing 
len ratingone Unfortunately the word Redeem now appears and it needs an invitation code 
len ratingone The update data did not provide the code 
len ratingone How can I test when it asks for something Apple did not provide 
len ratingthree Everything was great until this recent update 
len ratingthree Now I ve lost my connection to the apps I was currently testing 
len ratingthree Hope with the next update I am allowed back in UPDATE things are back to working again so I ve upgraded my star rating 
len ratingthree For now 
len ratingtwo How do I provide feedback on the NYT beta 
len ratingtwo There s no place in the app 
len ratingone One of the most pathetic app without delete existing app i m not able install new one 
len ratingone Every time shows me change store 
len ratingone What a process to force update the app 
len ratingone What a process to add new app in TestFlight for testing redeem code required 
len ratingone UX is pathetic 
len ratingone I never enjoy any apple s app 
len ratingone Apple must learn how to make apps from others as u know how to make phones u must know how to make apps 
len ratingone Android process is far better i guess one day android will beat iOS 
len ratingone I ve been testing some apps for quite some time in with no problems 
len ratingone Until this latest update I no longer have any of the apps I was testing 
len ratingfive Works great 
len ratingfive Everyone needs this app in their lives 
len ratingone Getting worse 
len ratingone This latest version is as everyone else reports all of my test apps are no longer visible 
len ratingone I ve deleted and reinstalled the app and the behavior is the same 
len ratingone I get an error when I try to open a test app through the email invitation 
len ratingone The app is broken please fix 
len ratingone Lost testing Data please restore or go back to previous version 
len ratingone  Everything was great until this recent update 
len ratingone Now I ve lost my connection to the apps I was currently testing 
len ratingone Hope with the next update I am allowed back in 
len ratingone  App after update dropped the betas and looks as it did before redeeming the codes 
len ratingone When TestFlight updated to my existing apps are hidden or were removed 
len ratingfive Not sure why everyone s harshing on this app 
len ratingfive Works great for me
len ratingone  Says I need to download the latest version but there is no new version to download 
len ratingone So to test in app purchases I have to log in to my store account install the build from TestFlight log out of my store account start the game log in as a sandbox account test the game then log out of the sandbox account and back into my regular account when I m done testing 
len ratingone Apple please don t make everything such a pain in the rear
len ratingone Looks like the last update removed my testing apps 
len ratingone This needs to be fixed ASAP 
len ratingone I updated Apr and now I lost all my apps I was testing and cannot accept new invitations 
len ratingone When I attempt to redeem an invitation TestFlight tells me I have already redeemed the code or accepted the invitation yet I cannot download and install any build 
len ratingone Man this is a major bug and now I m delaying my release 
len ratingone My testing apps have also disappeared inside TestFlight with this update though they are still on the phone 
len ratingone Not sure if I will still receive updates or not 
len ratingone With this latest update to TestFlight several apps that I m actively testing have disappeared from the app though the beta apps still remain on my device though a few remain visible 
len ratingone The apps that I m no longer testing have also disappeared into oblivion 
len ratingone This is a huge problem especially for app that I am currently testing I don t know if I will be able to receive app updates from the developer if they re not showing up in my TestFlight app 
len ratingone This must be resolved ASAP 
len ratingone Bring back apps that I m currently testing as well as those that I ve tested in the past 
len ratingfive I am beta testing an app by Andrew zeigler it s called lists with friends 
len ratingfive How it works is you can create a list or a category or subject or anything you can edit the name of the list at the top but it will not let me change the subject like in the list 
len ratingfive Also while using this app it crashes multiple times 
len ratingfive But if you fix those two things this could potentially be a great app 
len ratingone Keeps caching old copies of my app so after I install with a newer version this fail initially 
len ratingone Which basically makes TestFlight useless for testing 
len ratingone Please fix this it s a basic requirement for everyone 
len ratingone Literally you have to delete the app first and then reinstall multiple times to get rid of old cached versions of the app I m testing 
len ratingone Thus is dumb it s please sort this out for freaks sake 
len ratingone i can t even download the test build of Discordapp cause it s been stuck at like forever 
len ratingone Please fix thx 
len ratingfive This app has nothing to do with the app you re testing TestFlight allows you to download the app you want to test 
len ratingfive So if you re having crashes issues or anything wrong with the app that you re testing report it not to TestFlight that s what you are doing testing the app in beta 
len ratingfive This app delivers motivation focus intensity the speakers will inspire you and this app will become part of your daily routine 
len ratingfive It s very very good 
len ratingone This app supports push notifications 
len ratingone Why can t I or the dev I m testing for opt out of receiving emails for new software versions 
len ratingone I already get an app 
len ratingone It s redundant annoying and clogs up my inbox 
len ratingfive  qwq tap tap tap tap 
len ratingthree I have been developing for a little over a year now and I love how fluid the process is to provide new releases for beta testing and or demo s but the problem is the feedback responses for users does not seem to be a big priority with this app and that s one of my biggest needs 
len ratingthree It would be great if there were a way for users to do possible screenshots with notes and send them to the developer s email maybe even short video recordings of where people may see bugs or have questions 
len ratingthree With this I m still stuck with depending on vague descriptions that don t really help me fix things 
len ratingone Needs update 
len ratingone Not working properly
len ratingone  app wf 
len ratingthree  testflight 
len ratingone Spinning wheel of progress forever 
len ratingone Please fix asap
len ratingfive Help
