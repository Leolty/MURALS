lenfour ratingone stupid app keep refreshing
lennine ratingone force closes constantly, will not let me view comments.
lentwentytwo ratingone my app has not worked right, the way i comment on anything/everything has been down graded and is not user friendly.
leneight ratingone my phone is fritzing out since the upgrade.
lentwentythree ratingtwo i've always used facebook movie mobile, but lately i've been having problems with my timeline not refreshing with the current update.
lensixteen ratingtwo it always reads "network error." this also has affected applications that i have connected to facebook.
lensixteen ratingfour when i open a picture in this app, it irritates me by opening previously opened picture ...
lenfortyfour ratingone this app is so slow will not add my pics most of the time and crashes my phone alot i uninstall and re install allot but the next time i uninstall thats it not getting back on if i could i would give 0 stars

lenfive ratingthree it should have multi tabs ...
lensixteen ratingone won't load anything when connected to wifi then it started not loading anything at all.
leneight ratingtwo it's so painful when login facebook now.....
lenfive ratingtwo loading everything is so slooooooow.
leneighteen ratingtwo this application was great before the last update, when i open a pic it opens a different pic.
lennine ratingthree since the last update i cant post any status...
lenfifteen ratingthree for me to be able to post a status, i need to open a browser..
lentwentyone ratingtwo i use my phone almost  exclusivly to log into fb and not being able to delete or edit comments is unacceptable
lenthree ratingone doesnt load pictures.
lenfour ratingthree keeps on force closing!!
lenthirteen ratingtwo always force closes when i try to log in to games thru facebook.
lenseventeen ratingone i get a forceclose every other time i open facebook now and it's driving me nuts...

leneleven ratingone fix this thing, no network error , the app es near useless
lenten ratingtwo i can't get any pics in the news feed.
lennine ratingone each update becomes increasingly intrusive into your personal life.
lensix ratingone can't turn off location tracking...
leneighteen ratingone so sick and tired of getting network error messages when at the same time, facebook web works fine!
lentwentyfive ratingone i always have to close the app from my multi-tasking so that the next time i open it, it will hopefully load my newsfeed.
lenseven ratingthree pictures and new stories load pretty slowly.
lenten ratingthree my biggest pet peeve is that i can't "like"
lenfifteen ratingthree things 95% of the time, or it takes five or six taps to register the "like."
lenseven ratingthree notifications frequently take me to something irrelevant.
lenseven ratingthree this is constantly having problems loading comments.
lenfifteen ratingthree i can almost never get them to show on pictures, status updates or anything else.
lenten ratingone has anyone else been having issues with constant force close?
lensix ratingone can't post since last update.
lennineteen ratingone also, they need to make it so that you can hide posts from certain people like the website does.
lennineteen ratingtwo the app is good & all, but some images in my news feed can only be previewed instead of opened.
lenfifteen ratingtwo occasionally, the app says that the image can't be opened & please try again later.
lenfour ratingone move to sd please
lenfive ratingone news feed shows no pics...
lenseventeen ratingthree the only thing about the newer app i hate is the "like" and "comment" feature is broken.
lensixteen ratingone i have installed and  uninstalled this several time to get an up to date time line....
lenten ratingone slow, rarely loads anything - pages, photos, comments - nothing, constantly crashes.
lentwentysix ratingone i can't change my covert photo from my phone,  searching for anything is awful, i have to type , then delete, then retype, then it works.
lentwelve ratingone loading pics and comments take much longer, i.don't like it.
lenfive ratingone serious bug dealing with notifications.
lentwenty ratingone opening app from a notification after its been running in the background for a while results in endless wait loop.
leneleven ratingone never shuts down in the background and has no exit button.
lensixteen ratingone reinstalled to get the share link back bit the churning following a notification is still awful.
lensix ratingthree still has issues with check-ins. :|
lentwentythree ratingthree after the latest update, i have not been able to post status updates on the first try, even with strong 4g data or wifi.
lenten ratingthree generally speaking, the app seems much slower than previous versions.
lenten ratingthree i see "unable to establish a secure connection" errors often.
lenthirtyfive ratingthree also it refreshes while i'm trying to read updates in my news feed and seems me to top of news feed page so i have to scroll and search for what i was reading.
leneleven ratingone facebook crashes at least three times a day on my galaxy s2.
leneight ratingone i constantly clear data, but it still crashes...
lentwentyfive ratingthree cant post photos to certain albums, cant delete comments & sometimes when i try uploading photos, they say 'error and photo cannot be uploaded' or somethin :/
lenten ratingone now it won't even load, just keeps saying error.
lenseven ratingtwo doesn't update correctly, freezes a lot.
lennineteen ratingtwo needs fixed, doesn't show the comments or when i chose to look at pictures it doesn't load.
lenseven ratingone will not load this sucks try again :(""
lenfourteen ratingthree most recent didn't really show most recent feed, it still show top story.
lensix ratingthree scrolling lag from time to time.
lenfive ratingtwo slow loading after last update...
leneight ratingtwo rarely refreshes news feed on the first try.
leneight ratingone only shows up to 98 likes on a photo
lennine ratingtwo i wish we could save pics from this app
lensixteen ratingtwo does everything you would expect, still needs some work on the approvals for privacy confirmation process.
lenseventeen ratingtwo but the major issue i have is some background task is grinding my phone to a halt.
lenten ratingfour i cant delete comments anymore ever since i updated it ..
lennineteen ratingone pointless to even have on my phone anymore can't even use it like i should be able to..
lentwenty ratingthree the new update has made it so i continually get network error or no internet connection which is just rubbish.
lenfifteen ratingone after updating my system shuts down, i get errors and i can't post anything.
leneight ratingone will not refresh at all on my droid
lentwenty ratingone far too slow never loads , cant see anything , 'crap' any time i refresh it goes straight onto my actual internet !!!
lensix ratingone keeps crashing, forcing it to close.
lenfive ratingone also you carnt view pictures
lensixty ratingone yeah so this app ain't bad i use it more than the browser but that's gonna change, i was wondering why my phone memory was all gone so i decided to uninstall the updates now i got a load more memory, so until you can save this app to the memory card then i'm not using it.
lenseven ratingone won't even let me log in!
lentwentyfour ratingtwo for some reason i cannot update my facebook status, leave comments, like things or perform any action on the mobile device that actually works.
lensix ratingone keeps losing conection, therefore uninstalling updates
lenseven ratingthree on my nexus seven tablet, nothing loads.
lenseven ratingthree i simply get a network error message.
lensixteen ratingone dear facebook,  please stop prompting me to add friends every friggin time i open your app.
lenthirtyseven ratingfive it worked perfectly fine for me until yesturday when i was on my laptop and changed my password, it logged me off my phone so i logged in with the new password and it kept saying error.
lenfive ratingtwo can't remove comments anymore.
lentwenty ratingthree once more will ask me this app to find friends from phone contacts list i will remove it i swear.
lentwentynine ratingfour i gave it 4 due to works and really gd but needs to be less i have it at 33.12 so slow then and i want it to get below then 20
lentwentyfive ratingone keeps playing up freezing lots of force close coming up come on fb sort it out i use it everyday and everyday i have problems
lennine ratingtwo been having issues with newsfeed refresh prior to that.
lentwentyseven ratingone now it tells me i have a single sign-on error, which even the great google search has not given me any clues on how to fix.
lentwentytwo ratingone it will sign in, but won't sync anything and won't post anything so it's basically useless for my purposes.
lentwenty ratingthree so u have to ask me if i want to use my contacts to find friends multiple times a day.
lennine ratingthree can't type two words without the thing crashing...
lentwelve ratingfour the only complaint i have is that it has problems loading pics.
lenfourteen ratingone it's slow to load (probably because it's searching my 'phone for stuff) .
lentwelve ratingone wants access to my 'photos, contacts, their birthdays and so much more!!!
lenfive ratingone i cant share my location :/:=
lentwentyone ratingtwo come on , facebook, every other app on my phone has functioning notifications, why can't you mange to get it right?
lenseventeen ratingthree wow my facebook use to be so slow it is so much faster and hasnt frozen yet.
lenseven ratingone the recent update has blank pages now.
leneight ratingone i cant see any pictures on my app.
lenfourteen ratingtwo the app runs extremely slow and sometimes not at all on the mobile network.
lentwelve ratingtwo pictures wont load and neither will contents.works fine threw wi-fi.
lentwentyfour ratingone the problem is it is constantly syncing and that drains battery  uninstall for an hour and you will notice huge increase in battery life
lentwelve ratingone it kicks me out once a day and drains my battery completely.
lenten ratingone my facebook is even slower than it already was before.
lenten ratingone it forced me to update which should be our choice.
lensixteen ratingone plz can i save pic, and iportent can i dalete comt from my pic and stetes....
lenfive ratingtwo vryy sloww and too heavy..
lensix ratingtwo almst occupy my whole system memory...
lenseventeen ratingone after auto correct got a word wrong i went back to change it, then the app froze.
lentwenty ratingone however, recently i have found myself waiting for an eternity to get anything to load properly if it even does.
lenfiftyfive ratingone well i have top of the range phone,  fastest internet in the uk and this app fails constantly, how can a company this large not create a working application is beyond me,  slow, pictures and comments regularly fail to load, constant network errors and to top it off facebook fail to respond to these issues...
lennineteen ratingtwo when trying to watch a youtube video through fb, the option to watch through the youtube app is gone.
lenseventeen ratingtwo you're automatically taken to the mobile youtube site where it says the video cannot be played.
lensixteen ratingtwo pretty frustrating, since it happens every single time i try to watch a posted youtube video.
leneight ratingtwo pics on the status update page dont load...
lenfive ratingone this app is so slow.
lenfourteen ratingone why don't i have the same options i do on the facebook website?
leneleven ratingone why can't i remove posts from people on the app?
lenseven ratingone why can i hide stories or pictures?
lenfourteen ratingone and lastly it's very slow loading and sometimes doesn't load at all.
lentwentyone ratingone the update said "faster viewing of photos" and now i can't see any pics at all, not even profile pics!
leneleven ratingtwo wont let me upload pictures and only notify's me sometimes?

lensix ratingone all sharing options do not work

lenfortyseven ratingone this was a good app but now it will not show some posts or it will arrange them in any order that it wants i.e. first post will be from 2 weeks ago, the next post will be from a month ago, then the next from today.
lensix ratingone horrible tos for privacy/app permissions.
lentwentytwo ratingone you *do not* need my private text msgs, my photos, my entire contact list and address book to make this app successful.
lensix ratingone i'm not able to update.
lenseventeen ratingone last update i can't search for friends and won't load profiles or photos please fix
lenfourteen ratingone takes forever to load and most of the time doesn't load at all.

lentwelve ratingone the major problem, i believe is you somehow created a memory leak.

lentwentyfive ratingtwo Since recent update Facebook via this app is a hit or miss on being able to load the news feed yet alone updates on comments.

lenfourteen ratingthree Just crap do not get any notification but slightly better than the last update.
lentwentytwo ratingthree Its force closing a lot of my apps and i cannot log out and it always freezes can you PLEASE fix it -_-
lennine ratingone Takes so much internal memory and data usage too.
lennineteen ratingone New pop up windows do not imptess me when you break the rest of the app to do it.
lentwentythree ratingone My only wish for this app is to one day (ASAP) have it so we can all move it to the SD card.
leneight ratingone Takes far too much space on my phone.
lennineteen ratingone And having an HTC desire phone its already got poor phone memory without having this bugging up my space.
leneleven ratingone Too slow to load, pics won't show, drops connection - unusable.
lennine ratingthree I am unable to update the profile picture directly...

lentwentytwo ratingone I have been unable to update my status from my phone and unable to post on friends walls ever since the update!
lennine ratingfour It is app but  it work's slow sometime
lentwentyseven ratingtwo But shows your messages and inboxes after like half hour of someone sending them you...Its so frustating have to click on them myself just to check...
lenseven ratingtwo And its slow in the news feed...
lenseventeen ratingone Sometimes i open my messages because it says i have one and its an all blank page.
leneight ratingfour but my memory keep increase when i online.
leneleven ratingtwo It will try to load but return with a network error.
lenthirteen ratingthree What's a fuckin "katana process" that crashes facebook almost every hour now ?!!!
lenseven ratingone It sumtimes says error coonection it sucks
lenfourteen ratingone None of my pictures load and it just says network error all the time
leneighteen ratingone I have to force close multiple times just to do simple things like read comments or load pictures.
lenthree ratingone doesn't load
lenfourteen ratingtwo Really is annoying, coz i cant post whats on my mind at the time!!
lentwentysix ratingone No network connection and error loading story is driving me nuts that I nearly killed ant with my head while banging my head on the table.
lenfour ratingfour Can't quit facebook!
leneleven ratingone Why dose this app never tell me when someone messages me?
lennine ratingthree It doesnt connect sometimes and is slow fix it
lenseven ratingtwo The option to swipe and delete comments.
lentwelve ratingone Back to freezing up, force close, error posting comments, numerous other problems.
lentwelve ratingone You have to go in and out constantly to try to post.
lenfour ratingone TOO MANY ERROR LOADING!!!
lensix ratingone Status's dissapearing & doesnt refresh properly.
leneleven ratingfour Always resets to top stories even if most recent is selected
lenfifteen ratingtwo Wats wrong i am not able to post any comment it just gives me erorr
lenfour ratingone Wont share pictures either.
lenthirteen ratingone And also, since last update it appears this is chewing thru my data.
lenthirteen ratingtwo My pictures won't load on my newsfeed and its making me irritated
lenfifteen ratingfour I wish the new update had the option to save on my large SD card!!
lentwentytwo ratingone So frustrating, pictures don't show up at all keep having to uninstall and reinstall in order to get it to work.
leneleven ratingone Takes forever to load, says no network connection all the time.
lentwenty ratingone In order to get the latest updates on the timeline I will need to actually close and restart the app.
lentwenty ratingone Firstly, at least once a day when I am trying to refresh my news feed it will say 'network error'.
lenten ratingone Doesn't show comments or likes on statuses, wallposts, etc.
leneleven ratingone it's always clicks me out says there is an error..
leneight ratingone Stops working and shuts down all the time.
lenfive ratingfour low speed,no pic download.
lenfourteen ratingone Since last update I keep getting network error and can't update my status.
lenthirteen ratingfour Contact Sync is no longer and option and unable to check page messages
lennineteen ratingtwo The update is always crashing and whenever im in the middle of my chat it lags all the time... :(
lensix ratingthree But Not able to download images
lennine ratingthree Links don't go to app just to browser
lenten ratingone Terrible, can't upload photos anymore or update my status.
lentwentythree ratingthree I hate that you can no longer delete a comment you make on someone's post, or on your own for that matter.
lenfifteen ratingfour I and the one who i sent this code wants to see picture not number.
lenten ratingfour Can't find camera icon to change my cover photo.
lensix ratingone It doesn't work on Desire
lenfive ratingone Cant view an entire Photo.
lenthree ratingone Always force close.
lenthirtytwo ratingtwo Not to mention the fact that it force closes half the time, videos take too long to upload and have yet to add the edit comment tool as in the mobile site.
lenfourteen ratingfour Should implement a way my videos can be seen that are in my album
lentwelve ratingfour i want to exclude some folder to display in select picture page.
leneleven ratingfour And I want swift key to save the words I type.
lenten ratingfive I think it could do with a bit more customization...
lenthirtyone ratingfive And a few more settings for example, after I insert specific types of punctuation it sometimes put a space after..It would be good to be able to turn that off.
lentwentysix ratingfive Also another good one is being able to make the space bar bigger by removing the smiley key on the bottom right making the keyboard bigger.
lentwelve ratingfour I really would like to see Chinese language integration to be developed.
leneight ratingfour Very annoying to switch with other input methods.
lennine ratingone Does not work with S-Pen on Galaxy Note 2
lentwentyfour ratingfive I love the keyboards and what not it looks so awesome but just need some more themes to choose from or more customization choices.
lenfourteen ratingfive Last time it was smileys/predictions without spaces messing up other languages than english.
lentwenty ratingfive Used to work perfect but after i had accidentally deleted it, can't get it to work again after reinstall.
leneight ratingone It WAS awesome until the layout was changed.
lenthirteen ratingone It may work for large displays but NOT phones with cases on them!
lenseven ratingone I hate the new slide punctuation bar!
lenfive ratingone Bring smaller space bar back!
lentwentyfour ratingone You need to add something to allow us to edit the prediction word database. This way, we can manually erase unwanted crap, periods & commas!!!
lentwentyseven ratingthree When your in messages and lock the screen, once you turn it back on the suggestions are gone and you have to close and re open SwiftKey.
lentwentythree ratingone Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
lenten ratingthree Great app but without emoji support its only sub par
lennineteen ratingthree Im not fond of the fact, i have to constantly switch to go keyboard for Chinese either,  over rated.
leneleven ratingfour Wish I could customize the layout, then I would give 5 stars.
leneleven ratingfour Awesome keyboard just lags with Google takes forever to show up.
lenfourteen ratingfour I like how you did pumpkin for Halloween can we get a Christmas theme.
lensix ratingfour Because of missing of Macedonian language!
lentwentytwo ratingthree Ever since the jellybean update,  you have to exit the messaging application and open it up again for word prediction to work..
lentwelve ratingthree I also don't like that you can't use swear words.
lentwelve ratingthree I'm 23, please let me use what words I want to use.
lentwelve ratingone I am tired of this fueling keyboard refusing to use swear words.
leneight ratingfour Swiftkey's has limited 3 words predicted for selection.
leneighteen ratingthree I find it terribly annoying that now the prediction bar, and corrections don't work 50% of the time.
lenthirteen ratingthree I have to close the keyboard and then reopen for this to work.
lenthirteen ratingthree Also, I should be able to delete typos that have been presumed predictions.
leneight ratingfour It is missing one thing, however. Emoji support.
lenseventeen ratingfour If this language/font were to be added, SwiftKey would win the award for best Android app.
lenfourteen ratingfive After having the language constantly failing to download, and now not downloading at all.
lenfifteen ratingfive But very glitchy on Google chrome, keeps typing previous word when pressing the backspace key...
leneight ratingfour Only problem i have is the exclamation mark.
lenfifteen ratingfour Very very poor set up,  it almost never works when you swipe the multi button.
leneleven ratingfour Always puts a period or a comma, never an exclamation mark.
lentwelve ratingone Until I updated to Jelly Bean, I would give this app 5 stars.
lentwentyfive ratingone However, following the update on my S3 to Jelly Bean, it now reverts to the Samsung keyboard as the default every time I restart the phone.
lentwentyseven ratingone From my understanding, it is an issue the developers are aware of and have stated that we all need to wait until Jelly Bean is updated to 4.1.2.
lenfour ratingfour I just need Chinese!!!
lenfifteen ratingfour Otherwise it's such a pain to switch keyboards just to type one Chinese character!
lennineteen ratingtwo Keeps rebooting vzw gnex and numerous bug reports and posts left unanswered or even unacknowledged using pay version too...
lentwentyeight ratingfour Just wish there were more themes to choose from and that of your backspace from an auto completed word that it would defer to what you originally typed.
lennineteen ratingfour As stated before SwiftKey does not load after a reboot. It has to be disabled an re enable again.
lenfourteen ratingfour Great keyboard and prediction but needs SWIPE function for portrait mode and better customization
lentwentythree ratingthree Update: Using on the LG Optimus G and the cursor KEEPS  jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
lensix ratingfour But can't personalized with fb..
lentwentytwo ratingfour Uninstalled until I can save it to the SD card, everything is great except for the amount of space it takes up.
lenfourteen ratingfour This app is very good, but it can run a little laggy on my GS3
lenfourteen ratingfour Give me a red version of the "holo" theme and you'll get 5 stars.
lenthirtyone ratingfive The only thing I do hate is when I enter a full stop then  space it automatically In puts (I) so my sentences start with I when I'm typing fast.
lennineteen ratingone Used to be the best keyboard ever since jellybean update now on my GS3 it will not hold as default :'-(
lenseventeen ratingfive I would love to more themes, the current themes are great but I love customising my phone.
lenfour ratingfour Wheres the clipboard button?
lensix ratingone This auto correct is illogical sometimes.
lennine ratingone When I type "just"  I don't mean "justified".
lenthirteen ratingone It will also auto capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized.
lenfifteen ratingthree Was excellent but pasting has recently broken on my Samsung galaxy s3 which is very frustrating!!
lenthirtythree ratingtwo I don't know what sort of processor is expected for running a keyboard but swift key can't keep up with my typing for the most part on a Samsung galaxy tablet 10.1
lenthirtyone ratingfour Only suggestions I have would be a tab key for use with Web browsers and such and a personal dictionary would be nice to help speed the keyboards learning process up
lensix ratingfive Please add a few themes frequently.
leneighteen ratingone I love this keyboard,  but I notice a significant decrease in my battery life when I use it.
lenten ratingfive It would be perfect if there was a delete key!
lenthirteen ratingtwo I would give it 5 stars if predictive text was supported in all apps.
leneight ratingtwo As it stands, too many apps remain unsupported.
lenseven ratingfive Love it but needs emoji support now
lentwentyfive ratingtwo Pretty good,  I get sick of checking everything to make sure it's predicting what I actually wanted, it seems to lag a lot too
lensix ratingfive Just wish it had more themes.
lentwelve ratingfive One like Holo but red in place of the blue would rock.
lennine ratingfive Only thing is it couldn't input Chinese language.
lenthirtythree ratingfive I love this app best $3 I've ever spent drastically increases texting speed if you have it set up right could use some more themes like a black background with neon green letters
lentwentytwo ratingfive The one and only problem I have is this program needs to do a better with choosing which punctuation sentences should receive.
lentwentytwo ratingfive I would like it if there were emoticon add ons for this keyboard like there are some of the other ones though...
lentwentysix ratingthree This app is okay except that the keys are loud when I type, so if I'm working or hunting I have to change the settings.
lentwentytwo ratingthree And if I'm just not finding how to change the setting I apologize but I've looked everywhere on the phone
lenthree ratingfour Needs more themes!
lentwentyfour ratingfour Love the ".com"  button but I wish it were in a different place. Maybe put it on the left side of the space bar.
lenfour ratingtwo You need more themes..
lenthirteen ratingtwo It's a great keyboard,  I just get board with the limited options
leneight ratingone It's useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard.
lentwentyfive ratingfour In the Dvorak layout, the lowercase 'M' & 'W' keys are supposed to display '(' & ')' on long press. The 'W' usually displays a '0' instead, but occasionally readjusts.
lenthirtyfour ratingone This would have been a 4 star but the inability to hide the "com" button while in a browser renders it nearly useless. Hit it all the time when trying to hit the space bar.
lentwentyeight ratingfive I'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the Jelly Bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
lenfifteen ratingfour I the only reason I give it a 4 is because there is no swipe texting.
lentwelve ratingfour Would you be able to make an update with Vietnamese language though?
lenten ratingfive Just hope they continue to make it more battery efficient...
lenfifteen ratingthree 1 - The keyboard reverts to the original Android Keyboard every time the USB storage becomes disconnected.
lentwentysix ratingthree Every time I hook up to the computer or shut down the phone and restart, I have to re-enable it via the Android OS Settings.
lentwentythree ratingthree Great in most circumstances, but when sending odometer readings via text for tracking purposes, there's no reason for it to track it.
lennineteen ratingthree Numbers, for the most part, could probably be ignored or at least give us the option to ignore them.
lenfourteen ratingthree I don't need it suggesting an odometer reading I'll never see again.
lentwentyone ratingthree It would also be nice to be able to edit the remembered words and add or remove words, especially in multiples.
leneight ratingfour But could you guys add a swiping option?
lentwentyone ratingthree If I take the time to manually capitalize letters and add apostrophes, etc, then swiftkey shouldn't try to change it.
lensix ratingone Needs improvement in Arabic language support
lentwentyfive ratingfour My only wish is the ability to add words to dictionary & more keyboard options with symbols like hearts that come standard on most Samsung galaxy s3
lennineteen ratingfive The only weird thing I encountered was on my RAZR while it's charging the keyboard acts very weird.
lentwelve ratingfive Amazing app, although I wish there were more themes to choose from.
lenseventeen ratingfour It doesn't allow you to use the prediction features on text fields that already have it.
lentwenty ratingfour An example is when you type something on Google search app, you're abandoned to the slow typing process again.
lensixteen ratingfour The same happens in some contact names fields such as Gmail, GOSMS Pro, Any.do. Etc.
lenfortyfour ratingtwo I was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iPhone to Android until i tried Swiftkey, HOWEVER, i have  found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text...like the built in browser on my Galaxy S3 and way more Update;
lentwentyone ratingtwo giving up until they fix predictive text and make keyboard thy doesn't have all th keys basically touching each other.
lenfourteen ratingone whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
lenthirtyfive ratingone i have tried to ask if possible to add "numbers" on top of the keyboard like on Samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog... but no one answer, nobody care...
lentwenty ratingfour I'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for Vietnamese language...
lentwentyone ratingfour I would really like to see more customization like more keyboard clolors and maybe some emoj that's different from iPhone.
lenten ratingtwo This keyboard is good but it really needs more theme.
leneleven ratingtwo Just at least one of all the major colors. ESPECIALLY RED!
lentwelve ratingfour Please made available for moving app to rom for faster keyboard entries
lentwentynine ratingone It always adds spaces after full stops, and adds unwanted words after commas, I wish I hadn't paid for this before I knew there was a free version
lenthirteen ratingtwo Have turned off as does not support pen entered text on Samsung note 2.
lenten ratingtwo Have turned off as note ii does not work properly.
lentwentysix ratingtwo If you are not going to fix it then make it assignable to applications so it can be ignored for apps where it doesn't work.
lenfive ratingthree I want more color fonts
lensix ratingthree Why is there no Tab key?
lentwentyeight ratingthree But when I have to put numbers into a password or messaging someone and using numbers the numbers come out jumbled, please look into this, sent from my gs3
lentwentytwo ratingtwo I use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 on Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. The only complaint I do have are a couple of bugs.
lentwentyeight ratingtwo On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
lenthirteen ratingtwo I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
lenten ratingtwo It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
lenfour ratingone Fatal support for Polish.
lenthirteen ratingfour I really dislike how it fails to show predictions during Web browser use.
lensixteen ratingfive There are so many things you can tweak as well such as prediction invoking and theme.
lenthirty ratingfour Totally annoying when I'm used to typing as best I can and picking predictions from the list. At least please give us the option to turn it on / off.
lentwentythree ratingfour The only issue with it is that about 35% of the time the prediction bar does not show up/auto correct does not work.
lennine ratingtwo Great app but becomes sluggish every now and then.
leneighteen ratingfour However, give me the option to disable the auto space after punctuation and ill give it five stars.
lentwentyseven ratingtwo It's not a bad keyboard replacement but it insists on putting a space after periods, making it a real pain to type URLs into text messages.
lenthirteen ratingfour The only thing I really dislike is the space it adds after punctuation.
lenthirtyfour ratingfour I'm used to typing correctly in the first place so I add the space myself and SwiftKey adds one as well as you can see in this review with all the double spaces.
lenten ratingfour I want to turn predictions completely OFF, but can't?
lensix ratingfour 5 stars if could turn off predictions.
lentwentytwo ratingfive I'd love to see the option to enable a dedicated number row though, for those of us with those huge phones.
lensix ratingfour Just add emojis and more themes.
leneighteen ratingfour Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
leneighteen ratingfive Would like S Pen support for Galaxy Note 2 so I don't have to swap when writing documents.
lenthirteen ratingthree But the predictions bar doesn't appear for for the Samsung at all..
lenseventeen ratingthree And when I'm typing rapidly and trying to press the space button.. It hits the. com
lennineteen ratingtwo Whenever I try to enter a search term this app seems to stop working all together... Why is that?
lenseven ratingfive Wish for more keyboard themes to come.
lentwentysix ratingfive Love this keyboard and just got the update to JB on my EVOLTE and was wondering if you guys were implementing Emoji support for the keyboard?
lentwo ratingthree Emoji support.
lenseven ratingthree Why doesn't any keyboard have emoticons?
lentwentysix ratingfour This keyboard is amazing but the only problem I have with it is that when I use Google drive it slows down and lags SO much.
lenseven ratingfive I just wish they would add swipe
lennineteen ratingfive Would like to see a couple more themes, but I have no complaints as the Holo theme is gorgeous.
lentwentythree ratingfour I think it provides a great writing experience, but it slows down my overall smartphone readiness and needs an huge amount of ram..
lenfive ratingfour A ridiculous amount of RAM!
lenfourteen ratingthree Please provide swipe support like the latest keyboard update provided by Google for nexus.
lenthirteen ratingthree When ever I enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
leneighteen ratingthree Lack of hand writing support for the Note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
lennine ratingthree Loved Swiftkey3 on my evo hate it on the note
lennine ratingtwo A lot of bugs in connection with hardware keyboards!
lennine ratingtwo The app also has trouble downloading the language packs ...
lentwentyseven ratingone Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
lentwentyfive ratingone Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
leneleven ratingtwo Love the word suggestions but keyboard locks up constantly on my S3
lennine ratingfive But can we have more themes for the keyboard =)
lentwentythree ratingfive Edit: The keyboard stop predicting when I am in Any.do, Facebook web browser and several other applications that I couldn't remember.
lenthirtysix ratingthree Though India is a big client of all mobile handsets and apps, everybody is neglecting Indian customers and their needs,I am hopefully waiting for Hindi,Marathi and other Indian languages upgrade packs from swiftkey ASAP.
lenforty ratingthree However,  every time I close all apps and ram memory and I go on any sort of message board,  texting or any type of typing it doesn't automatically pop up with SwiftKey and it shows the regular crappy keyboard.
lentwenty ratingthree Long story short I have to go change the options to have SwiftKey on every time I want to text.
lentwentyone ratingfive Suggestion for the developer: make that when the hardware is changed you don't loose all that the app has learned.
lensixteen ratingfive I wish there were more personalization options with colors, to match the theme For your phone.
lensix ratingfour Won't start automatically on GS3 however.
leneight ratingtwo But it is not compatible with 4.1.1  So frustrated.
leneighteen ratingone Split keyboard does NOT work on the Note in spite of thousands of users flagging it inside reviews.
lennine ratingthree I hope that swiftKeys will implement chinese typing too.
lentwelve ratingthree The keyboard gets laggy sometimes and makes apps lag on jelly bean.
leneleven ratingthree Most notably Google now.... it's very slow whilst using swiftkey.
leneight ratingfive I wish there will be more themes added
lenthree ratingfive Please integrate swype.
lentwentynine ratingfive Anyway I couldn't thank SwiftKey any better for such an amazing keyboard, just wish that they will come out with better features and personalization along with new themes!
lenfive ratingone Prediction does not work anymore.
leneight ratingfive I only wish they had more color scheme.
lenfourteen ratingone With a recent update to Jellybean, SwiftKey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
lentwentytwo ratingone I have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
lenfourteen ratingthree I was very disappointed that when installing the paid version it did NOT import.
lentwentyfour ratingthree The settings from the trial version and now i am left having to battle the same initial problems when i first inatalled the trial.
lenfifteen ratingthree Very disappointing that such an intuitive app is so non-intuitive in the upgrade process
lentwenty ratingone Since I updated my S3 to Kelly Bean sometimes SwiftKey is not even activating when I go to text or type.
lenthirtyfour ratingone I have to exit whatever I'm doing or send a text or 2 before it will start working, but as I said it's very inconsistent, was never an issue while using with ICS.
lenfiftyone ratingfour I love this keyboard hands down the best one on the market only issue is for some reason when I I'm typing fast the keyboard always seems to static like a tv with no service I thought it was my phone but now I have the note 2 n same thing..
lentwentyseven ratingfour I just hate how when I click the 123 icon on the keyboard I hate how the layout looks,  im use to the regular S3 keyboard 123456789 on the top
leneleven ratingfive 5 stars either way but an Emoji add on would be awesome.
lentwelve ratingthree I don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
leneighteen ratingthree I wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
lenthirteen ratingthree Would have given this 5 stars if it worked well with king soft office.
lensix ratingfive Drawback, could do with more skins.
lenthirtyfour ratingfour Great keyboard only issue I have is when my phone wakes into a text it doesn't use prediction so I have to back out and go back in for the prediction to work
lennine ratingfour Was working excellently on 4.0.3, but in 4.0.4, has some defects...
lenfifteen ratingfour Feeling a small hick when keyboard comes on screen and sometimes it does not work...
leneighteen ratingthree Can't go without this keyboard anymore, though I'd still love to be able to disable gestures
lenfive ratingfive It does occasionally stop typing.
lensix ratingthree Kinda laggy when opening and closing..
lenthirteen ratingfour Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
leneleven ratingfive The Arabic implementation is very good but needs some fine tuning
lensix ratingtwo Can't remember my email address.
lensix ratingtwo Has a problem remembering simple words.
lenthirteen ratingthree Please fix the cause for the keyboard not sticking as the default keyboard.
lentwentythree ratingthree I used this a long time ago, and picked it up for a buck during the sale, but it needs more customization options.
lenseven ratingthree Namely, the smiley key needs custom smileys.
lentwelve ratingone Pls update thai language i have been waiting for the long time
lentwentytwo ratingtwo Sometimes word prediction doesn't show up. Have to exit out of keyboard then get back on again for it to appear.
lenthirteen ratingfive really loving it ;)  wish it wouldnt eat so much ram tho 28mb of ram?!
lentwentyfour ratingfour I would like some more customization options, such as disabling the keypress letter highlight, custom skins (even if just hex colors from a file).
lenthirteen ratingfive I have no complaints, just a request that you keep adding new themes!
lennine ratingfive English, of course, but with Korea prediction and everything?
lensixteen ratingfour The beta edition for Thai has been expired. Could you add it to any Thai peoples?
lenthirtytwo ratingfive My only flaw is since the jelly bean update if I have the keyboard open in messages and my screen locks; once the screen comes back the prediction function doesn't work
lenfifteen ratingfour It works great for everything but not so good when add ing non common names.
leneighteen ratingone something is happening and it is causing me to have to download the language over and over again.
leneight ratingthree But I would love a cleaner looking interface.
lenseventeen ratingthree Would love to have a option to hide all the extra long press keys minus the numbers.
lenfifteen ratingtwo Frankly some of the predictions are ridiculous you are better off with the normal keyboard.
lenfive ratingthree Not compatible with jelly bean.
lenfive ratingthree Resets after boot or restart.
lenseven ratingthree Will not set itself as default keyboard.
lenseventeen ratingone I recommended it to all of my friends, but ever since ics this app has been HORRIBLE.
lenfive ratingone The keyboard is horribly laggy.
lentwelve ratingone I've downloaded it more than 3 times and it keeps saying error
lentwentyone ratingfive Only issue found till date is that it crashes often with chrome, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
lenfive ratingfour Only complaint: no swype mode.
leneight ratingfive Would be better if echo stopped cheating though
lenthirteen ratingfive Would be cool if we could have some emojis added on to it
lennine ratingone Due to error 941 this is bs. Cannot refund either
lenfive ratingtwo Wouldn't install on my gs3
lenten ratingone I just purchased this app but it says error downloading.
lenfive ratingone It does not install. Error 941
lentwentytwo ratingfour I enjoy this app as it helps correct my errors fast but it doesn't remember the personal words I put in.
lennine ratingfour And I'd like to see more, newer themes.
lenseventeen ratingfive The only thing that I can think of to make this app better would be more themes!
leneleven ratingfive I just wish there was an option to hide the keyboard.
lenten ratingfive Bigger space bar, more themes, faster responses, and more intuitive.
lentwelve ratingone Every time you reboot your device it reverts back to stock keyboard!
lentwentytwo ratingfour As mentioned by some others some times it seems to slow down on certain other apps while the original never did so.
lentwentyseven ratingfour I sure don't mind but at the same time making even speedier and smooth as jelly bean is on my s3 would always be greatly appreciate it.
lenseventeen ratingfive They updated recently with two new themes, but they're too girly. How about a few more?
lenten ratingfive It would be nice if it used the personal dictionary.
lenthirteen ratingfour Developers could add a slide type of writing and that would be awesome.
leneleven ratingfour I would give it a 5 if i support chinese as well.
lentwentyseven ratingone But after a month of having it, it became extremely slow, typing on the screen would not happen, half the time corrections would not even show up.
lenfifteen ratingfour But since I root my phone, I constantly change roms, therefore reseting all my words.
lensix ratingfour It feels bad reseting 2000 custom words.
lenfiftynine ratingthree I was hoping to have a good heart symbol with the key board because that's something a girl uses a lot for commenting on photos and stuff like that if added, and I would be much happier with the application and rate it a five stars but, there are not a lot of color choices for your keyboard......
lenthirtysix ratingfour The functional keys in the bottom: shift, enter, backspace etc. come in a certain color with every theme. I would like this color to be fully customisable to make it fit my phone's theme better.
lenten ratingthree Best prediction keyboard available but mediocre design and button placement.
lenthirteen ratingfour Amazing keyboard and good value but it needs to have slide/swipe options.
lentwentyone ratingone Predictions and double space bar to accept predictions and insert period are not longer available in browsers and many other apps.
lenfive ratingtwo Spell check randomly stops working.
lenten ratingtwo Prediction will sometimes turn off when I sleep the phone.
leneleven ratingfour Need S-Pen button and writing grid for the galaxy note!
lenthirteen ratingfour Needs better emotes and I thinks that's it except maybe custom keyboards.
leneighteen ratingfour If you could customize the keyboard to a different colour for all keyboards, I will give you 5 stars.
lensixteen ratingfour The back-spacing on the keyboard is a bit slow. I wish I could adjust it.
lentwentyfour ratingtwo This work great for a while but now keeps crashing my phone and my phone won't work again until I pull the battery
lentwentythree ratingfive Just need to be sure that you check over what you're typing as it can get weird if you're not careful.
lenfour ratingfour Just add swype pleeease
lennineteen ratingfour Only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is I can not use swype as on the Samsung keyboard.
lenthirteen ratingtwo SK3 was working flawlessly until the AT&T JB update for S3 recently came out.
lentwentysix ratingtwo When locking the screen while having the text field open and the keyboard out and then unlocking the phone, the text field rewrites itself and resizes.
lenthirteen ratingtwo Also, there is lag in the keyboard processes when sending and receiving messages.
leneleven ratingtwo Will return to give 5 stars once jb update issues are resolved.
lenthirtysix ratingthree I would like to see the numbers separately above the the first row of the keys. And when on land scape mode it takes up the whole screen and will not show you the text screen.
lentwentyfour ratingfive I've had it for a whole but avoided using it because it doesn't matter have the heart symbol like the Samsung keyboard.
lenseven ratingfive (I still hope for some hearts :D)
lentwelve ratingfive I do wish it supported Japanese characters, but otherwise it's perfect.
lenthirteen ratingfour Plzzzz i luv swiftkey but no vnmese support is a dealbreaker for me
leneighteen ratingfour Nice keyboard but even in its new v3 incarnation there's no dedicated voice key, hence losing a star.
lennine ratingfour C'mon Swiftkey, YOU NEED A DEDICATED VOICE KEY!
lennineteen ratingtwo It doesn't have a percent symbol, what the hell kind of keyboard doesn't have a percent symbol
lensixteen ratingtwo Would be awesome if it didn't keep resetting back to its original settings every 5 mins.
lentwentytwo ratingfour atm the lowest sound level for the type writer style sound is way too loud, I'd really like a quieter option!
lenthirteen ratingfive wish there was some more themes for it like maybe a pink one? :-)
lentwentythree ratingtwo Used to work brilliantly with previous android versions but the Swiftkey auto correct function stopped working after using it with Android jelly bean.
lenthirtythree ratingthree As much as is pains me to say, this app has been the root of a bunch of problems on my phone. Crashes and freezing are all too familiar when this is active.
lenseven ratingfour But I wish it used less memory!
lenthirteen ratingfour The word "it's" is almost impossible and always comes out as "is".
leneight ratingfour Also could you allow use of could words?
leneight ratingfour Please integrate learning from WhatsApp Messenger as well.
lenthirtysix ratingfour At the bottom corner there's an option for the regular smileys while texting but can there be an option to switch those to emoji or even an option to change them to what you want?
lenseven ratingfive Sometimes wish it had more themes though.
lennine ratingfour Only snag is the haptic feedback doesn't work.
leneleven ratingfour However the shift key could be either less sensitive or moved.
lenthirteen ratingfour Often times when I hit the "A" key I hit the shift key.
lensixteen ratingone I can't download the language pack. It's the same error over and over again.
lensixteen ratingthree Good app but the Turkish dictionary is very insufficient. It doesn't contain many basic words.
lennineteen ratingfour I request developers to add the support for training the keyboard through whatsapp similar to twitter, Google and Facebook.
lensix ratingthree Suggested words were never accurate either.
lensixteen ratingfour It's good but I'm only going it 4 stars because it doesn't have swype.
lensix ratingthree The best,no s-pen detection?
lensix ratingthree where is handwriting for s pen?
lensixtythree ratingfive My only issue with this and it's a SERIOUS issue with me is that since I got the update for my S III to 4.1 is that I can not find out how to turn off the haptic feedback when I type. The phone's settings have it turned off but no matter what I do to try and troubleshoot it, nothing works.
lenfour ratingfour would love more themes!
lenfifteen ratingthree But, it's been almost a year and I think one new theme was added!
lennine ratingthree Come on guys... Get on board the theme wagon!
lentwelve ratingfive Would like to see manual selection between languages instead of auto detection.
lentwentytwo ratingfive This by far the best keyboard out there, but with my recent update to JB, its kinda laggy and not so functional.
lentwenty ratingthree As mentioned by others, Google search has slowed with the keyboard not appearing for several seconds when using this keyboard.
lentwentynine ratingfive I have had this keyboard since I first got the Evo, I just love it, I wish it allowed me to input emojis but it is still a 5star app!
lentwelve ratingfour SwiftKey please add: Swipe, personal dictionary and prediction for email and name.
lenfive ratingone Not working with jelly bean
lenfourteen ratingfour Some of the predictive text functions are annoying but its a good app otherwise.
lensix ratingfour Pleeeaassseee come out with more themes....
lenfourteen ratingfour I'd still like an editable dictionary of the words that it has learned.
lenfour ratingtwo Closes while I type.
lennineteen ratingtwo Puts in wrong words when I have the right words and completely omits words when I type too fast.
leneleven ratingtwo Oh and the voice recognition of voice to text barely works.
lenfifteen ratingfour After updating to jb, there is no heptic intensity control. It's always full blast.
lentwenty ratingfive But i don't like keyboard skin model, if you can make keyboard skin like original keyboard, itu Will great
lenthirty ratingthree Just updated my AT&T galaxy s3 from os 4.0.4 to the new 4.1.1 jelly bean and my paid version of swift key 3 no longer works and keeps force closing fix this please??
lenfortyeight ratingfive If you just make it possible to sync user dictionary with Google drive so we can have it with Multiple devices (that will let you have the new words you typed in all of your devices) and don't lose them if you wipe or change the device.
lenfifteen ratingfive Syncing will be great in background with every time the keyboard shows up and disappears.
lenten ratingfive Or please add a way to customize your own theme.
leneighteen ratingfour swiftkey is really a good keyboard.. but not perfect for me, hope can improve by adding chinese language.
lenten ratingfour besides, slide to delete not so sensitive, hope can improve
lentwentyseven ratingfive Updated to Jelly Bean. I have all haptic feedback turned off on my phone, but after the update it has been turned back on only using SwiftKey.
lenfive ratingfive It's draining my battery.
leneleven ratingone My phone stoped responding While using the keyboard seince recent update.
lenseven ratingfive Just improve the polish and french dict. :-)
lentwentythree ratingfour This keyboard was stunning on my old Galaxy Ace2 but I now use Galaxy S3 mini running Jelly Bean 4.1 and now Swiftkey will not work.
lenthirtytwo ratingfour The keyboard refuses to pop-up when i require to type ( in all apps including txt, kingsoft office, WhatsApp log-in's etc) and I hve to revert to the Samsung keyboard.
lenfive ratingfour Regretably had to un-install.
lenthirteen ratingfive The swipe down gesture to minimize the keyboard doesn't work very well.
lentwentyseven ratingthree Now, occasionally the text predictions won't come up AT ALL and it seems like words are being put in that I NEVER was attempting to write.
lentwentyfive ratingthree Also, I am not too fond of the fact that when I do spell a word wrong, it doesn't automatically insert the correct word.
lentwelve ratingfive we need more themes!! like a red and green one for Christmas!!
lenthree ratingfive or color personalization
lenthirteen ratingtwo Now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!!
lennine ratingtwo And I don't want to type in landscape.
lenten ratingone Autocorrect no longer works since they put out swiftkey flow.
lenfortyone ratingfive Have noticed a bug with it though (although not sure if this is a bug with the keyboard or with android), whenever my phone runs out of battery or I restart it for any reason, the keyboard defaults to Samsung Keyboard.
lensixteen ratingone After turning on phone keyboard does not load. Have to go into settings and choose again.
lensix ratingthree It misses the hinglish language support.
lenthirtyone ratingfive It still lags on viber but over all it is amazing but yeah when is SwiftKey Flow coming to this app or making a new one the is the flow version??
lentwentysix ratingfour Issue 1: I don't use smileys!! Please give me the option to have a persistent enter key, instead of the smiley key forced by some apps.
leneighteen ratingfour Issue 2: Alt keys layout. Couldn't you just set it out like EVERY OTHER KEYBOARD ON THE MARKET!?
lenthirtythree ratingfour I want my numbers where they are shown on the main screen,  I want my alt keys where they are shown on the main screen. At least give the option to your users.
lentwentyone ratingthree This keyboard is amazing for English but it doesn't have a Japanese option so it's very inconvenient for me.
lenten ratingfour The only 'complaint' is that the themes are quite awful.
lenseventeen ratingone When I'm on Facebook I only get the keyboard. No auto correct or word - guess - er.
lennineteen ratingone Also when I finish a word at the end of a line I can't insert a space bar??
lentwentyfour ratingfive I love this apps,  it's a good keyboard app but i strongly request for the Chinese input cause ii use it a lot.
lenfifteen ratingfour Slow to minimize on JB Maxx HD update, the functionality however destroys ics/jb keyboard.
leneleven ratingfour Awesome keyboard needs more haptic feedback and it will be perfect.
lenthirteen ratingfive Waiting for chinese support, it's amazing to try this kind of input.
lenthirteen ratingfour It would be more awesome if they would add a screen shot key.
lenfive ratingfour Can you add traditional Chinese?
lenfourteen ratingfive The keyboard is now running slow, freezes  takes a while to open and close...
lenseventeen ratingfive I love everything about the app except for one thing, I wish there were more theme options.
lentwelve ratingfour I have a galaxy note and the swiping feature doesn't work..
leneight ratingtwo Love the keyboard but its really slow now
lentwelve ratingone When I changed it back to the samsung galaxy keyboard it stopped.
lenthirteen ratingfour The only complaint is have is that there isn't a customized dictionary.
lenten ratingfour It doesn't predict words I use all the time
lenten ratingone Pls update thai language im waiting for the long time
lentwelve ratingfour I deducted one star, however, because it causes crashes with some regularity.
lenfour ratingtwo Needs another simultaneous dictionary.
lentwo ratingtwo Annoying censorship.
leneighteen ratingtwo I can understand censoring explicit swearing but words like "gay", "horny" or "sex" get changed into something else.
lenthirteen ratingtwo "Erection" gets go changed into "election" although the letters aren't even near.
lensix ratingtwo Also, apparently, dictionaries not too complete.
lenfour ratingtwo "Egyptian" doesn't exist.
lensix ratingtwo Writing in Portuguese is a pain.
lenthirteen ratingone since the update when i type, it puts random periods and wrong text.
lenthirtythree ratingone I get an error message when I try to install the language pack that says there is a problem with the network connection, make sure your network connection is working, then try again.
lenseventeen ratingone I think the problem may be that this new version of the Note is running Jelly Bean.
lentwelve ratingone I see that some others running Jelly Bean are also experiencing problems.
lennine ratingone If got Chinese input I will give you 5 star.
lenfive ratingone Hope faster get Chinese input!!
lenfour ratingone Were need Chinese input!!!
lennine ratingfive Normal typing just doesn't cut it any more.
lenfortyone ratingfive Normally I would give it only four stars because there are still a few very minor bugs that need ironing out from a power user perspective, but this app is one of the key selling points for Android, in my opinion.
lenthirtynine ratingthree Why is the smiley face button more important than the enter button? With a keyboard that's supposed to be fast and cater to the user it makes no sense as to why this shouldn't be an option.
leneight ratingone Why does it learn from everything except whatsapp?
lentwelve ratingfive The keyboard sometimes have a lag when typing, especially on number pad.
lentwentytwo ratingfive Other thing is that the layout is confusing when you need to quickly use symbol, I like my S3 stock keyboard layout more.
lenthirteen ratingthree Back to 3 stars until they add an option to disable the key popup !!!
lentwentyseven ratingfour My only slight annoyance is when the ".com" key appears. I wish there was an option to hide it, I seem to press it on accident often.
lenfourteen ratingfour Also, why does SwiftKey continually give me a notification for choosing the default keyboard?
lenfourteen ratingone After upgrading to Jelly Bean, this app had stop working, language pack  download failed...
lentwentythree ratingfour I purchased this app because it simply awesome but after I movedto jellybean it'sshowing error crashes and copy and paste optionsare disabled.
lentwo ratingfive More themes..?
lenfourteen ratingthree Works perfect but for some reason it lags when I exit the typing mode.
lentwentyseven ratingfive Only thing is that if you screw up the last word of a text message and hit send it doesn't fix that last word before sending..
leneleven ratingfive Please make it fix the last word when we hit send.....
lenthirteen ratingfour Could use an update for better keys on 7 inch tablets  Like my nexus 7
lenfourteen ratingtwo Im one of those people who depend on auto correct and it never works.
leneleven ratingthree Good keyboard but ''percentage'' symbol missing and not very good performance...
lentwenty ratingone Thanks forbalways adding words when i hit the space bar and for always learning the wrong way to spell words.
lenseven ratingfive Would love to see more themes though!
lenthirteen ratingthree but no compact QWERTY option which I think is essential in portrait view
lenfive ratingtwo Not compatible with jelly bean.
lenfive ratingtwo Resets after boot or restart.
lensix ratingfive more themes would be appreciated dev.
lensixteen ratingfour Please please please revert back to a seperate "!" button like in the old version of swiftkey.
lennineteen ratingfour I press "!" "?" and "." way more often than the letter "q". It deserves its own place. 1 button for 3 common keys?
leneight ratingfour BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEPARATE KEY FOR "!" AND "?"!!!
lenthirtythree ratingfive One thing it needs is the ability to change to the writing pad as I am using the galaxy note 2 and sometimes I prefer it that way, otherwise this is almost near perfect.
lenten ratingfour The only thing I would add is more customisation options!
lentwenty ratingtwo This app is very good w/ English  But Arabic layout is very annoying, Please use Windows layout instead of MAC
lenthirteen ratingfour But why does it take up 27 MB of RAM on my Galaxy Nexus?
leneighteen ratingfour The more RAM programs use the less program you can run EFFICIENTLY, slowing down the phone in general.
lenthirtyfive ratingfour Often I notice slowdown on my phone and find app taking up RAM for no reason and have to uninstall the Hogs. This is similar to the memory leak problem Firefox has on the desktop.
lennineteen ratingfive Could you add a new theme "RED NEON" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
lenfive ratingtwo Arabic letters are rather small
leneight ratingfive but uses good amount of ram in background.
lentwentyfive ratingfour It's a decent keyboard replacement but I feel that the famous prediction and correction engine is a little overhyped especially the auto correction part.
lentwentythree ratingfour For example typing lowercase free standing "i" isn't auto capitalized, typing "whats" isn't auto corrected to "what's" and so on.
lenseven ratingfour It also takes a lot of memory.
lennine ratingfour Sometimes its a bit freaky how predictable this is.
lensix ratingfour Just wish it had more themes.
lenthirteen ratingthree But frequently it does weird things when trying to type on the Web.
lentwentytwo ratingthree (Dolphin) Frequently when entering text in a field it repeats the first key press instead of typing the letters I am pressing.
lenthirteen ratingfive Best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
lentwenty ratingfive It would be nice if it had some options to take advantage of the huge screens that are coming out.
lentwentythree ratingfour Good but please have a save to see card option I payed 4 bucks for this and I takes up a lot of space.
leneight ratingfive But would like to see more colors please!
lenfourteen ratingfive this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of ram
lennine ratingthree Jelly Bean resets Swiftkey when the phone is restarted.
lensix ratingfive Any chance to add Chinese language?
lensix ratingfive Just wish you could swipe also
lenfour ratingone Main problem prediction (lithuanian).
lenthirteen ratingone Would be more stars if there was possibility to turn off the prediction.
lentwentytwo ratingthree Now it seems to be making up its own words and not correct anything even when I have cleared the language data.
lenten ratingthree It needs a number row like the stock note keyboard
lenthirteen ratingtwo When I use this keyboard on my gs3 it is very unresponsive and laggy.
lentwentytwo ratingfive Only complaint is the amount of RAM needed and the delay that occurs when closing the keyboard after hitting the home button.
leneleven ratingfour I will support you if you add support for Japanese language.
lentwentythree ratingfour It kinda annoys me that it has persian (who in the world speaks persian) and not such a widely known language as Japanese.
lenthree ratingfive More themes please.
lenfifteen ratingfour Only request is for a collapse keyboard button. Sometimes buttons like that are just needed.
lensix ratingone Time for more themes thank u
leneight ratingfive Love it, all it needs is more themes.
lenten ratingfour I'll give 5 stars when the Jellybean issue is fixed.
lenten ratingone I want to see performance increased for the Samsung Galaxy S3.
leneight ratingfive All the app really lacks is more themes.
leneight ratingfive Good keyboard but, can we disable the prediction?
lenten ratingfive Once the swype features are added it'll be unrivalled!
lenthirteen ratingfive Just wish you had more themes or ability to make a custom theme.
lentwenty ratingone I dont know what the dev thought when he decided to ask for email and facebook access (major security concern).
lennineteen ratingtwo The app is supposed to allow y to delete mistaken words you don't want in the language model.
lentwentythree ratingtwo I press and hold the prediction, and there is no option to delete! It's really annoying because common typos then become predictions
lenseventeen ratingthree After reboot im locked back into the Samsung keyboard, help me it is already set for default
lensixteen ratingfour But the only downside is that since jellybean update its constantly "forget" the default keyboard selection...
lenseventeen ratingthree Overall product quality is very good except it's user defined library doesn't work with whatsapp.
lennine ratingthree Because of whatsapp issue I can just give 3 stars...
lenthirtyfive ratingfive My only concern is that when entering emails the app needs to recognize that you are doing so and needs to adjust accordingly (eithout automatically spacing after periods, auto capatilizing letters for certain email addresses).
lenfive ratingtwo But really bad performance on 4.1.
lenseven ratingtwo Hangs often and really slow button response.
leneighteen ratingfour The only issue I have is that it is slow to start up at times in most apps.
lenthirteen ratingfour Please fix the slow start up times and this is a perfect keyboard!
lenfifteen ratingfour I love this keyboard but have started having an issue after upgrade to Jelly Bean.
lentwentythree ratingfour The Predictions row gets turned off each time I wake the screen if the keyboard was open when the screen goes to sleep.
lenten ratingfour If I close the keyboard and reopen, predictions come back.
lenseven ratingfive Let's get some more themes now! ;-)
lenseventeen ratingfour but now that i use voice input, there is no easy way of inserting a full stop.
lentwentynine ratingfour add a feature so that while talking to the mobile, there is another button beside the mic icon to insert a fullstop and you willl get your 5 stars back!
lentwentyfour ratingfive Certainly the best for typing, the only thing I would like you to improve in a upcoming update is maybe a few more themes?
lentwentytwo ratingfive As petty as it sounds I would love a red keyboard to match the rest of my phone's theme and case!
lennine ratingfour All we need is Chinese input (I prefer strokes)
lensix ratingone No word prediction in various browsers.
lenfive ratingone No dedicated # row option either.
lenfifteen ratingthree If only you can move cursor by sliding finger accros the keyboard, not with arrows.
lentwentytwo ratingone It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.
lenten ratingone But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
lensixteen ratingthree SwiftKey makes my typing hella fast and easier but there need to have a Chinese input..
leneight ratingfour 1 suggestion, pls add more theme for this app
lenthirteen ratingfive If they could integrate a bit of slide like FlexT9 it would be unbeatable.
lentwelve ratingthree Auto correct and predictions only work on few apps for jelly bean.
lennine ratingthree Can't even get it for the default browser.
lentwentytwo ratingthree Also, when I have the keyboard enabled, it for some reason disables the handwriting feature in the Samsung Keyboard for the Note 2
lennineteen ratingfour I like this a lot more than the standard key pad thing, would get 5 stars if you added swype.
lentwo ratingfive More themes!
leneight ratingone I can download any language except for English.
lensix ratingtwo **still not saving any new words!!
leneleven ratingtwo Seems to have totally forgotten a lot of my saved words.
leneighteen ratingtwo Also if I type too fast it just deletes the word and I have to type it again.
lennine ratingthree Changed to three stars because it loves the battery.
lenten ratingthree Cut my S III's battery time almost in half.
lentwentytwo ratingthree PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz make the key board respond faster
lenfour ratingfour EXELENT BUT NO WWW
lenthirtyone ratingfive My only gripe is that when I hit close to the 'i'  key I sometimes hit the 'u' key instead,  and i never use u for you so this bothers me.
lenseventeen ratingone It doesn't support one hand operation which is so essential for the giant screen of Note 2.
lentwelve ratingthree I use the swipe on android and this keyboard  dont have it
lenten ratingthree I don't like how laggy it can be sometimes.
lentwelve ratingthree It is especially bad when I switch between numbers/symbols and letters.
leneighteen ratingthree I also have speed issues when I'm touch typing like I would on the normal android keyboard.
lennineteen ratingfour But PLEASE add swipe right as a redo. (swipe left deletes a word,  so swipe left undoes that deletion).
lenseven ratingfour I often find myself accidentally deleting words...
lenfourteen ratingthree Its take so much time for pop up and its typing speed is slow
lenfourteen ratingthree The predictions don't show up and it won't auto correct my words.
lentwentytwo ratingone My version has a few misspelled words that it automatically displays in the predictions window. Cannot edit the dictionary to remove them.
lenseven ratingone SmartSpace is terrible, unadjustable, and too invasive.
lenten ratingone FYI: SwiftKey doesn't like the Moto LapDock at all.
lentwentyfive ratingfour Certain behaviors like automatic spacing after periods are a pain in the @$$ when trying to type in my email address that has periods in it.
lenten ratingfour An option that disables automatic spacing after punctuation is necessary.
lenthirteen ratingfour I would also like to see an option to edit the personal dictionary.
lentwelve ratingfour Its a great keyboard however I wish it suppoerted the samsung swipe.
lentwenty ratingtwo As mentioned in title, please consider to add numeric key at top row, this will significantly improve the typing speed
lenseventeen ratingfive Bug: when typing words beginning with a capital letter on Firefox, that word won't be written
lenfive ratingone And plz provide new themes.
lenfourteen ratingfour Sometimes the auto predict won't even come up when you're texting/typing.
lentwentyseven ratingfour Some of the minor problems I have with it are the fact that the keyboard wants to insert an I if you hit enter after a period.
leneighteen ratingfour I like the fact that it can predict my words but I rarely start a sentence with I.
lenforty ratingfour Also some of the words it will allow me to type and won't correct are some of the most mispelled words, although there are only a handful and the keyboard will learn which words you use and don't.
lenthirteen ratingthree I love this keyboard, but since updating to 4.2.1, I've got performance issues.
lentwentytwo ratingthree First, the keyboard takes too long to show up  second, the keyboard lags when typing rapidly (it used to be buttery smooth).
lentwelve ratingone Would have been great to receive the incompatibility warning PRIOR to paying.
lensixteen ratingtwo The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
leneight ratingone It keeps inserting words I don't want.
lentwo ratingone Limited dictionary.
leneighteen ratingone Costs me way more effort than the std keyboard because I have to go back constantly to correct.
lenfourteen ratingthree Just little niggles like not working correctly in Chrome like user name and captchas.
lensix ratingthree Emoji support would be awesome please.
lentwentytwo ratingfour This is an outstanding app and I would give it a 5 rating if they can add: (1) Swipe functionality and (2) More keyboard themes.
lenten ratingfour The current set of themes lack the look and feel.
lenfifteen ratingone Keeps saying it saved me 10,000 keystroke but it doesnt take into account the 50,000 it missed.
leneleven ratingone Doesnt even put an apostrophe on the doesnt in this critique.
lenfive ratingfive Just lacking the ! shortcut now.
lenthirteen ratingfour I can't fix typos often when I already have typed other words.
lentwentytwo ratingfour I'll go back to fix it and when I press the backspace button, it adds chucks of words instead of erasing.
lensixteen ratingfour Also, when typing in all capitals, the auto correct is very bad. Especially the first one.
lenfifteen ratingfour Rarely has a hiccup, but some keys I'd rather have on the main board.
lentwentyfive ratingfive Speaking of which though, I wish there was Japanese and Chinese available so I don't have to keep switching keyboards just to type those!
lenfour ratingfive Please add more themes
lenseventeen ratingthree Great app but you lose the ability to add standard Samsung characters, like the hearts for example.
lenfour ratingthree Also no personal dictionary.
lentwentyone ratingfour What about being able to learn from whatsapp as I do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
lensix ratingfour We also need Italian keyboard layout
lenthirteen ratingfour I gave it a 4 because I thought it would have more color customization.
lenthree ratingone Need Thai language
lenfive ratingone Dude where are the themes!??
lentwentyfive ratingthree When I just had the trial version the app worked like a charm but now it freezes from time to time for no apparent reason.
lenthirtyone ratingthree I am forced to exit the program and start over from the beginning-sending emails is even worse - in landscape view it is almost impossible to see what you are writing
lenfourteen ratingfour Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that we can't type in Chinese!!!
lenthirtythree ratingfour I mean, there's even languages I have never heard of, but not Chinese mandarin...oh and another, at times it doesn't automatically autocorrect and a word such as "gjakdn" will pass
leneleven ratingone Tle letter for arabic keyboard is small very difficult to write
lennine ratingfive Only thing I'd change is more theme options
lentwenty ratingfour After my Galaxy Nexus got updated to 4.2, the keyboard was gone.Not just gone as default keyboard, but removed uninstalled.
lennineteen ratingtwo The basic s-pen function is not there and you have to revert back to the basic android application.
lenfourteen ratingfive I commonly have the problem that it will not do predictions in landscape mode.
lensix ratingfive Need a button to toggle predictions.
lenseventeen ratingthree Now it's just like any other keyboard, not keeping my regularly used terms in its dictionary.
lentwenty ratingfour It's lacking customisation to make it efficient enough to compete with Swype which makes touch typing feel like swimming.
lentwelve ratingone The auto correction is totally busted(makes you write like a retard)
lenseven ratingone The setup is overly complicated and confusing.
lenten ratingfour Please add a vibrate setting like the stock Android keyboard.
lenfiftyfour ratingfour I have noticed that the standard Samsung keyboard method will come back every now and then and I have to swipe to get the notification center and change back to "SwiftKey 3" from "Samsung keyboard" on my Galaxy S3. It will happen every time I restart the phone and then try to text or anything else.
lentwentyeight ratingfour On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
lentwentythree ratingfour I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook. It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
lentwentyfive ratingfour The only problem I have with this keyboard is that sometimes it will interpret my fast typing as a deletion swipe, which can be frustrating -
lentwenty ratingthree It doesnt work with fb chat... which is the ideal situation to make use of fast typing and auto correct.
lenthirtytwo ratingfive the only improvement that SwiftKey needs is the ability to paste into whatsapp - to do this right now i have to switch to the Samsung keyboard and hold the 123? Button to paste.
lenthirteen ratingthree The keyboard layout is not to my liking and cannot be changed much...
lentwenty ratingthree If I just press space bar many times it writes a long sentence somebody else wrote me in an email...
lensix ratingtwo There is a ton if lag!
lennineteen ratingtwo I start to type and it doesn't register until seconds later and I've already written a paragraph.
lenfive ratingtwo Eats a ton of RAM.
lentwelve ratingone Major issues with Chrome fields.... Jumps all over the place, erases characters.
lenfourteen ratingthree Personally I find I type less accurately with this keyboard than the stock one.
leneight ratingthree Also don't like the numbers/characters panel.
lenthirteen ratingthree The option to have a more classic looking one wouldn't go amiss.
lenthirteen ratingfive Awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
lentwentyfive ratingone I posted a review telling that on Samsung Galaxy Note doesn't work very well, it keeps crashing and freezing my messaging app and whatsapp.
lentwelve ratingone Sometimes I have to wait MINETES till I can use it again.
lennine ratingfour I can't stand not having a dedicated '?' key.
lenten ratingfive And speed but every update resets my personal word info.
lenseventeen ratingfive Please allow a backup and give us the option to ADD our own words with priority settings.
lenfive ratingfive Excellent keyboard but Japanese please!
leneight ratingone Does not work in dolphin browser on my GS3.
lennine ratingfive Now need feature to backup learned language from typing.
lenfive ratingtwo Why still not support Chinese?
lentwentyeight ratingtwo On occasion the cursor will stop moving beyond the last word, so it always appears as if it's in the middle of a world no matter what.
lenthirteen ratingtwo I am also unable to use predictive text when sharing anything to Facebook.
lenten ratingtwo It renders it useless anytime I see something Facebook worthy.
leneighteen ratingfour Easily the best keyboard on Google Play, just needs to catch up with Asian language support, especially Japanese.
leneighteen ratingfive Just needs to add quick-insert of predefined strings, and a few tweaks such as completion with hyphen.
leneleven ratingthree Taking up too much memory of late on jb 37mb at times
lennine ratingone Prediction and ai learning how you type stopped working!
leneight ratingfive But keyboard too small on my Motorola ATRIX.
leneleven ratingthree Good keyboard, great predictions, but loses stars for not having macrons.
lenthree ratingthree Please implement macrons!
leneleven ratingfour I love this app but how come chinese is still unavailable?
lenfour ratingfour When it support Chinese!!
lensix ratingthree But it not have Vietnamese language.
lenten ratingfour Could u guys please add Chinese to the languages list?
lenthirtytwo ratingfive When I use the multitasking multi windows, the SwiftKey keyboard stays the same size when in the Samsung keyboard it gets smaller and the keyboard Window is able to be moved around.
lentwentynine ratingfive One fault could be the lack of personal dictionary as it doesn't allow you to save words you use the most etc other than that it's brilliant.
leneight ratingtwo Would rate this 5  if it  had Japanese language.
lentwelve ratingtwo I saw the update but disappointed to see no Japanese input yet.
lenthirteen ratingthree It's a fairly good keyboard but the autocorrection isn't very strong.
lennine ratingthree For example, typing pf isn't changed to of.
lentwentyfive ratingone For some strange reason the swiftkey keyboard keep on skipping keystrokes in random places as I type, making it completely impossible for me to type
lensix ratingfour Awesome must have, but no emoji.
lenten ratingfour And the Swedish dictionary is broken, splits composite words up.
lenten ratingfive still not loading automatixally at boot even with 4.1.1 os sammy s3
lenfifteen ratingfive I hate how it keeps capitalizing the letter "i" even tho auto capital is off...
lenten ratingfive My "enter"  or "return"  key has disappeared while using WhatsApp.
lentwentyfour ratingfive Even in GoSms, the enter key has shifted to the last row and it's place has been taken by the back arrow key.
lenfourteen ratingthree It's great keyboard but I've waiting for THAI that you're developing :-)
lennineteen ratingfour It's be nice if you could edit smileys or if you had multiple smiley sets to choose from.
lenthirteen ratingfour Just recently app repeatedly force closes until it is disabled in input settings.
lennineteen ratingfour Frustrating since I had to delete all of the learned suggestions, but it's back so I'm happy.
leneight ratingfour Great app but wish there were more themes
leneight ratingfive Sure would like to see some new themes
leneight ratingthree Keeps switching back to the dafult Samsung keyboard.
leneight ratingfour Reset of phone required to fix issue temporarily.
lenten ratingfour The only thing needed is swype to make it complete :)
leneleven ratingfour When it has 2 languages selected it mostly makes predictions in one
lentwentyeight ratingfour Great app very easy to use and I love the level of customisation but is does suffer from over sampling the keystrokes while the phone is being charged.
lenten ratingfour Otherwise perfect, although this is kind of a big deal.
leneight ratingfour I could not even personalize my writing style.
leneleven ratingfive I want it to be able to learn from whatsapp too!
lensix ratingfour please add emojis and other stuff
lentwentyfour ratingfive You might also have to change a few small settings to taylor it how you want it to auto space, period, and what not.
lenseventeen ratingthree Currently messes up when trying to type comments, messages etc on the mobile website version of Facebook.
lensixteen ratingthree It would be better if it could be used on Google Search and on my browser.
leneight ratingfour I just wish it worked on my Facebook..
lentwenty ratingtwo but lags like hell often when u wake up the phone after deep sleep and feel like smashing my phone ..
lenthirteen ratingfour Great app but needs to be a little more customizable, or more themes.
lenseventeen ratingfour Also, a selection of copyright and trademark symbols , ?, this very important key is currently; hard to find.
lentwentyfour ratingfour This vital key should be front and center considering the level of proprietary issues, that arise; daily, from social media postings; from general observational
leneleven ratingthree And now it doesnt want to download the english or spanish
leneleven ratingfour Is there anyway swift key can create a red color theme?
lenthree ratingone Watsapp conflict + more
leneleven ratingthree The keyboard is great, but hard to use with one hand.
leneight ratingfive Only thing missing for me is a <3 emoticon.
lenfour ratingone Punctuation key is annoying.
lennine ratingone Please give option for tighter or old keyboard layout.
lenfive ratingone Arrow keys are unnecessarily large.
lensixteen ratingfour 1. Predictive text would be great while typing at anytime on the phone, not just for sms.
lenten ratingone The whole number/symbol entry screen needs to be redone.
lenseventeen ratingthree But one major flaw on this for a fast typer is the lack of MULTI TOUCH support.
lenthirtytwo ratingthree And for god sake why don't you put an option to turn off "family filter" so i can write properly instead of seeing duck everytime i want to write something else.
lentwelve ratingfive I wish you could still use swype but everything else is AWESOME
lenfifteen ratingfour Wish I had options to make font larger on the keys, like A.I. Keyboard.
leneight ratingfive Wish the keyboard could show Gtalk's emoticons.
lentwentytwo ratingfive If there is a negative comparing the 2 it would be the lack of customisation compared to smart keyboard pro, which is endless!
lenfifteen ratingfour It would also be nice to have more themes or support for third party themes.
lenten ratingtwo Why isn't the predictive typing working in dolphin browser?
lenten ratingfive I like swype but the space bar is too small.
lentwentyone ratingfive Here's any idea you guys should come out with different key board themes for each holiday like if you agree
lenthirtyfive ratingthree It would be good if this paid for app would be a bit more configurable ie allow me to add an apostrophe on the main keyboard rather than have to go to the supplementary one
lenthirteen ratingone Smilies as default on the enter key are a deal breaker for me.
lenfifteen ratingfive Love the keyboards just Wish I could change typing sounds other than that great app!!
lenseven ratingfour Wish they had some better looking themes
lentwelve ratingfive Only thing missing is Welsh lang. Basque, Catalan, Galician, Icelandic... no Welsh?
lenfive ratingone Add Jelly Bean emoji support!
lenfive ratingfour Add more keyboard skins please!!!
lentwentyone ratingfive The update killed it on my thunderbolt. :( it says its turned on but I only get factory keyboard when I type
leneighteen ratingfive I just wish they had more language options like Japanese and Chinese, which I hope will come soon.
lenten ratingfive I'm hoping we are getting some new Good themes!!!
lentwentynine ratingfive Why they decided to put numbers on the left side and symbols on the right is beyond me (rather than numbers along the top and symbols on the rest).
lensix ratingfive Please continue develop the Spanish language.
lensixteen ratingthree It works well but there should be an option for adding custom words to the dictionary.
lennine ratingfive Currently enter key does not commit best to match.
lenfourteen ratingfour Also not happy with the collection-of-data warning at the beginning of installation.
lentwentyseven ratingfour Love the keyboard and all its features, but I have not been able to bill my provider's acct for Google play downloads ever since installing it.
lenseven ratingthree Without the personalized dictionary, I uninstalled it.
lennine ratingthree Also, they need to make enoticons easier to access...
lenseventeen ratingfour Please add marathi and hindi language support and the app will be the perfect keyboard  for 5 stars.
lenseven ratingfour Please add the marathi and hindi font.
lenthirteen ratingfive Only complaint is it would be nice to import settings from the trial.
lenten ratingfour It would be nice if they had more keyboard customizing.
lennine ratingfour Add some more themes, keypad and key press tones..
leneight ratingfive Not as accurate as it used to be.
lennine ratingfour I only wish it was trace/swipe text capable.
lenten ratingthree Please make the tablet version an option inside this app.
lensixteen ratingfive Only minor issue I have is I wish there was more themes for the key board
lentwentyone ratingthree My favorite, really, but it makes me have to switch to other input methods because of the lack of Chinese support.
lentwentythree ratingfive No problems at all, better than stock Samsung, but like others are saying, a personal dictionary would be great and the word shortcuts.
lentwentyfive ratingtwo SwiftKey plus chrome plus certain types of forms (particularly ones that require an email address) leads to a very ugly slow motion crash on ics.
lenseven ratingfive need to fix arabic on jelly bean
lenseven ratingfour Recently experiencing freezing at times in landscape.
lentwentyeight ratingone Every time I'm typing a long status on face book this keyboard will take words I'm typing and put them in the beginning of the status.
lenfive ratingone uses excessive amounts of ram...
lentwentyseven ratingfive I tend to hit the letter "b" instead of the space bar sometimes and it fails to predict that I'm trying to hit the space bar.
lenthirteen ratingtwo This crashes at minimum ten times a day during web browsing via Chrome.
lenseventeen ratingone the. com button when typing in a browser url is the most annoying thing about this keyboard.
lennineteen ratingone I love the keyboard but when I type texting 6 times and it shows tearing I get a bit frustrated.
leneight ratingfive Gets removed as default keyboard after every reboot.
lentwentyseven ratingtwo Too bad, because I did enjoy the features of SwiftKey, but I make so many errors using SwiftKey on the HOX that I can't use it.
leneight ratingthree Can you PLEASE fix the lag with ics?
leneleven ratingfive But won't  stay as default when start up or reboot?
lenfifteen ratingone Constantly crashes, slows down the phone, and uninstalls active language to force internet connection establishment.
lenten ratingone This app shouldn't require constant internet connection to work.
lensix ratingone Font doesn't change with theme.
lenseven ratingthree Backspace is often triggered as well randomly.
lenfourteen ratingone The default keyboard setting for SwiftKey is going away when I remove the battery.
lenthirtyone ratingthree Suggestions are awesome, but not many things annoy me as much as when I type something and SwiftKey changes it to something wrong even though I didn't choose a suggtion.
lensix ratingfive Chrome + SwiftKey = constant freeze and crash.
leneleven ratingone It's getting tedious setting SwiftKey as my keyboard each time.
lenten ratingthree The space that inserts after a punctuation is fairly annoying.
lennine ratingone And 30 to 40 mb is too much for a keyboard.
lentwelve ratingone Doesn't predict swears, custom words, or abbreviations w/ symbols (ie. "w/").
leneight ratingthree You select the correct spelling and nothing happens.
lenthirteen ratingthree Typing an email address is a pain in the ass with this app.
lentwelve ratingfour One little thing annoys me tho: the auto correct is really stubborn!
lentwentythree ratingone There are plenty more like me - see your "new features" topics on your support pages. An option to disable this would restore 5 stars.
lentwenty ratingfour Only annoying bug on JB, is that whenever i reboot my phone, the keyboard reverts back to the JB one.
leneighteen ratingthree Upgraded to an LG intuition and, while it still functions properly, it does not stretch across the screen.
lenfourteen ratingone For some reason, my nexus s defaults to Samsung keyboard and it really annoys.
lenten ratingtwo The latest update causes Chrome to constantly crash on the S2.
lenfifteen ratingtwo Had to stop using this keyboard because it's made browsing impossibly slow and frustrating.
lennineteen ratingthree On occasion, the words selection bar doesn't appear and the letters typed are not accepted by the application.
lenthirtyone ratingfive when I reboot my phone (Nexus S) the stock android keyboard is the default one, so I have to go back to the settings to make swiftkey the default keyboard again.
leneighteen ratingfive Was great when first purchased but following an update it no longer works on my HTC Desire HD.
lenthirtyseven ratingtwo My use case: Type something and select one of the three suggestions on the top of the keyboard. In my scenario (three languages, de/en_US/he) this fails a lot (I think mostly with German words).
lentwelve ratingfour 4 stars because no predictive text in web browser on JellyBean Galaxy S3 LTE.
lenthirteen ratingfour Typing email addresses and other long but irregular words can be a pain.
lennineteen ratingtwo Deleted after a week or so as it was constantly irritating me and just wouldnt let certain words go .
lentwenty ratingthree It shows up briefly after long press(which is inconvenient too) and goes away after a fraction of a second.
lensixteen ratingfour Basically, you don't have to release the long press to get the long press option.
lennine ratingfive But please add Chinese language support, really need it.
lenthirty ratingfour When in horizontal view you can't see any of the other persons messages. I even changed the layout to small to give more room but still won't show.
lentwelve ratingfour It's pointless to even go horizontal if you can read anything.
lennineteen ratingone Every time I restart my Note 2 (AT&T) I have to re select swift key again to use it.
lenfive ratingfive How about a character counter.
lenthirty ratingfive When I am writing on some apps that limit characters, such as a status update, I can't see how much I have put in without hitting the back button.
lenfourteen ratingfive You could add a character count on the right above/below the send button.
lenthirteen ratingfive Would be even better if the personal dictionaries could be synced to cloud.
lenfour ratingfive Could be more customizable.
lenfourteen ratingfour I just took one star off because shortcuts/ personal dictionary would make it perfect.
leneighteen ratingone But continuously 'disappears.' All settings are correct but it will not appear when I need to type something!!
lenseven ratingfive Also, I'm ready for more themes.
lenthirtytwo ratingthree Was great on my nexus s but on the Xperia u it causes quite a bit of lag on coming up and down to the point where the whole phone feels sluggish.
lentwentytwo ratingthree That isn't to say that the dwiftkey keyboard is bad, if it weren't for the lag it would be great
leneighteen ratingfive What I like here is the intelligence and the prediction power, which, by the way, can be improved.
lenthirtynine ratingfive Now the prediction is based just on recent writing, if I go back to continue a bit older texts with special terminology I realize that all the power of prediction is gone, have to learn it again from zero..
lentwelve ratingfive And in Romanian predictions are not even close to those in English..
lentwentytwo ratingtwo However, now with Jellybean 4.1.2 when swift key is selected as default keyboard, it takes quite awhile for the keyboard to open up.
lenten ratingfive It's would be refreshing to see other keyboard themes.
lenseven ratingthree Sometimes the suggestions don't pop up.
lenfive ratingtwo When is more themes coming
lentwentytwo ratingone It's been MONTHS since hundreds if not thousands of users faithfully and trustingly waiting for the additional of Chinese language support.
lenten ratingone But with more languages added,Chinese never made the list.
lenten ratingfive My only issue is lack themes! Please add way more .
lentwentyone ratingthree PLZ FIX TO WHERE THE KEYS WILL RESPOND TO PPL THAT TYPES FAST IT FREEZES ALOT N IM A QUICK TXTER
lenten ratingfour Unfortunately, the keyboard is simply not visible when using Chrome.
lenseventeen ratingfour Awesome keyboard but lacks pen detection for Note ii. Please include this in the next update :D
lentwentyfive ratingfour its a bit of a hassle to keep on changing between this and stock keyboard when I want to use the S-Pen Thanks :D
lensix ratingfive I wish it had trace however.
lenthree ratingone Need more themes.
lentwo ratingone Need t9 input
lenthirtyseven ratingone My use case: Type something and select one of the three suggestions on the top of the keyboard.  In my scenario (three languages, de/en_US/he) this fails a lot (I think mostly with German words).
lennineteen ratingone Type something, select the completion and the current text isn't replaced with the selected word, but removed entirely.
lennineteen ratingone Combining multiple languages in one keyboard (one for de/en_US instead of two different) is crap as well.
lenten ratingfour The portrait mode doesn't give me a predictions anymore.
leneleven ratingtwo But it makes my browser crash allmost everytime I use it.
lenfifteen ratingfour Great except every time the phone turns off it resets to the default Samsung keyboard.
lennine ratingthree Any reason why I can't load language packs?
lentwenty ratingtwo Some apps result in SwiftKey replacing the enter key with the smiley key as primary and long press as enter.
lennineteen ratingtwo If there was an option to remove the smiley and leave as enter this wouldn't be an issue.
lentwentyfive ratingfour 1, an option to add/remove words from the dictionary is present. The current method for word learning requires a few uses of the desired word.
lenfourteen ratingfour 2, a backup feature, so I don't lose my dictionary when I migrate phones.
lenseventeen ratingtwo SwiftKey 3 its crashing in web browser (chrome and stock browser) while selecting search bar and editing txt.
lensix ratingfive Although you should make more themes.
lenfourteen ratingthree It doesn't seem to access my Gmail for personalization, it keeps saying failed.
lennine ratingfive Is there no way of changing the language priorities?
lenthirtytwo ratingfour Faroese language is not registered, and I understand why because it is so small, but I wish I somehow could personalize the languages even more.so that it automatickly remebers faroese words
lenfourteen ratingone runbish, installed but wouldnt download languages so couldnt use it pluss couldnt re fund
leneighteen ratingtwo Has been my keyboard of choice for a while but it just doesn't work on Jelly Bean -
lenfourteen ratingtwo if you can't download the language packs you can't use the keyboard!
lenseven ratingone Cannot download the languages or use it
lentwentyone ratingone I just heard all these good things about this app and then right from the start the languages don't download...
lentwentyseven ratingtwo Before it started hiding key. When you long press a key to get the options it hides behind the other keys but only on 3rd party text boxes.
lensix ratingfive But there should be more themes
lensixteen ratingthree PLZ make more themes n can u make the key board look like adapt keyboards plz
leneleven ratingthree The keyboard itself is great but the word predictions are atrocious.
lentwentyfive ratingthree Why can't it learn directly from all of my typing, instead of having to via gmail, twitter or Facebook - none of which I have.
lenfour ratingthree Please improve the predictions.
leneighteen ratingfour It's alright I guess but it seems to have a knack for freezing up high end devices
lenfifteen ratingfive But keeps failing to download English language pack update so now I have no autocorrect :(
lenthirtyfour ratingfour I would give it a 5 star as it's perfect but it's annoying that despite being set as my default keyboard I still have to switch to it every time my phone restarts.
lentwentyfour ratingtwo I like the speed it allows me to type but the predictions that automatically insert when I don't notice change my word completely.
lentwentyseven ratingtwo And the most annoying thing of all that hasn't been fixed yet by any update, is the app some how turns off my haptic feed back.
lentwentyfive ratingone There's a bug where the predictive keyboard doesn't always register. You have to come out of the message and go back into it.
lenthirtyfour ratingthree The word prediction is spot on, the different themes look great, but the inability to use swype is annoying, as is the inability to use ALT+backspace to delete an entire line of text.
lentwentyeight ratingtwo Because if a user inputs a VALID word, the program should NOT auto-replace it with anything else, no matter how much more relevant it thinks that is.
leneleven ratingfive Only thing lacking is the ability for handwriting with note 2 spen.
lentwentyfive ratingfour I'd like it more context sensitive (eg: email vs sms, my gf vs my boss,  etc), but not sure if android passes that info.
lenfifteen ratingfour IT FORCES CLOSE WHEN USING ON CHROME, quite randomly, but too often to be acceptable.
lensixteen ratingfour But has an annoying habit of auto correcting correctly spelt shorter words into inappropriate longer ones.
lenfourteen ratingfour this is the best keyboard ever, but it eats quite a lot of memory
lenthirteen ratingthree As I'm typing the cursor jumps to the middle of a sentence.
lensixteen ratingthree It has some great features, but there is a noticeable lag with my GSM Galaxy Nexus.
lenthirtyfive ratingone the whole point of the Samsung Galaxy is the swiping, it differs from every other kind of phone, and this app does not support swiping this app sucks,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!!!!!!
lenthirteen ratingone 5 stars when i can disable prediction in favor of more screen real estate.
lensixteen ratingone Was working fine until it said that it is unable to load language packs, including English!
lenseven ratingfour 1. Landscape is always full screen (no option)
lenthirteen ratingfour 2. No option to toggle auto-space after punctuation and selecting predicted/corrected word.
lentwentyfour ratingfour 2. Prediction doesn't show up in a lot of cases where it should - should always pop up unless in a username or password dialog.
lenfifteen ratingfour 4. Speech to text doesn't come up reliably - many times pops up and immediately disappears.
lenfive ratingfour 5.  Sometimes sluggish to open / type.
lennine ratingthree Why there is no Chinese language in this keyboard.
lenseven ratingthree And also pls have more theme color
lentwelve ratingfour Would give 5 stars but it keeps defaulting back to the stock keyboard.
lenthirtyfive ratingthree I would absolutely love it if you guys could make an update that would allow the user to be able to type in a SWYPE style format instead of having to punch letter after letter.
lentwentyseven ratingfour Lately there has been issues where the auto correct won't work and sometimes I'll type but nothing pops up, not until I try like 100 times
lentwentynine ratingfour 1) SwiftKey should learn from sms, Gmail etc automatically without having to go through settings manually. Before I knew this it annoyed me SwiftKey wasn't learning from my sms.
lenthirtyfour ratingfour 2) when you type a word that's not in the dictionary and SwiftKey changes it to something I don't want, when I backspace I should have my originally typed word as an option.
leneight ratingfive I just wish I could download more themes
lentwentyone ratingfive In the configuration screen I set it as my default keyboard but after a while it keeps shifting to another keyboard.
leneleven ratingfive Wish we had a support forum about the product we download.
lennineteen ratingfive Could you add a new theme "RED NEON" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way)....
lenthirteen ratingthree Please add emoji there is alot of free keyboards have the emoji symbols :-$
leneight ratingone Phones keeps hanging and crashing after last update
leneleven ratingthree very nice keyboard but only thing lacking is choice of themes.
leneight ratingthree almost all themes are with closely spaced keys.
leneighteen ratingthree you guys shud add more themes like sony keyboard style or iphone style or stock android jellybean look
lennineteen ratingfour Loving this keyboard so far, would give it 5 stars except that there is no support for Chinese typing yet.
lentwentytwo ratingfive Minor niggles are: Please make apostrophes, colons and semi-colons behave like commas and full stops. ie automatic changing of space position.
leneleven ratingfive Apostrophes could be dealt with better too with respect to prompting.
lentwentyone ratingfour Only problem I ever had was that it often capitalizes words it shouldn't. Like the dutch word "door" or "dank".
lenseventeen ratingfour Perhaps implement swipe that works as well as Google's implementation and I'll try it again?
lentwentyone ratingfive My only gripe is that it doesn't have more black themed keyboard for us AMOLED screen users (to save power!).
leneight ratingfive The Neon theme is getting a little old...
leneleven ratingfive It crashes every time when I add tags into Tumblr app.
lensix ratingthree I wish it was swype capable
lenten ratingfour Only if there were more options to customize the UI.
lentwenty ratingfour Got no use for smileys, instead I'd like to bind that to open the second page of special characters.
leneight ratingtwo Doesn't learn some words despite multiple entries.
leneleven ratingtwo And now it's failing to show the predictive word bar.
lenfourteen ratingthree Works great except several times everyday I have to set it as my default.
lentwenty ratingone Got annoyed after they teased us with an upcoming swype like feature and haven't heard anything about it since...
lentwenty ratingfive Well would be better if it were a bit more customizable where the user can define the words and shortcuts.
leneighteen ratingfour Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
lenten ratingfour Since I updated to 4.2, the keyboard has been way slower.
lensix ratingtwo Unable to install after second step.
leneleven ratingone Seriously what's with them having access to everything we type???
lennine ratingfive Would love it if it had more symbols though :)
lentwenty ratingthree Not the first time the bloody thing outdates all language packs with no warning when I have no network access.
lenten ratingfour The only thing it's missing is more character options!!
lenthirteen ratingfive Awesome keyboard but hopefully there will be han yin pinyin support real soon
lenthirtysix ratingfour It's an amazing keyboard except that if you misspell a word and it underlines it, and you select the proper word it doesn't actually change it. It just puts the cursor at that location.
lentwentynine ratingfour This is a great app even if now there is the new android 4.2 but to get 5 stars it HAS to have SWIPE like in the new version of android!!!!!
lenfifteen ratingfive I only wish there was an option to disable the instant space after a punctuation.
lentwenty ratingfive I constantly hit the space bar after inserting a period which adds a word that I didn't want there.
leneight ratingthree On jellybean now on note 2. Really buggy now.
lensixteen ratingthree Very slow to backspace through words and randomly won't display autocorrect suggestions or correct anything.
lentwelve ratingthree Have to close keyboard and reopen to get suggestions way too often.
lenthirteen ratingone Has been brilliant but something has caused the language packs not to download!
leneight ratingfour But on my Thunderbolt multi touch has issues.
lenfifteen ratingfive It's a very good application but it support traditional Chinese language will be perfect.
lensixteen ratingfive One thing though, it always corrects "texting" to "testing" is texting not a word or something?
lenseven ratingfive A few more themes would be nice.
lenfifteen ratingfive Only thing missing is a clipboard but other than that it fires on all cylinders
lentwenty ratingfive My only complaint is that every time I restart the phone, it goes back to the default factory Samsung keyboard.
lentwentythree ratingone Everytime I turn my phone off or restart it it goes back to default keyboard and I have to keep activating this one...
lentwentythree ratingone Can't turn off the auto inserted space after a period or question mark. All my messages now have extra spaces after them.
lenseventeen ratingthree Love this keyboard, but every time I turn the handset off and on it loses default settings.
lentwenty ratingfive Only one problem is that I don't always get the word select option in some apps such as Firefox.
lenfiftyone ratingthree It's the best keyboard I have used by far, and I love the themes (but maybe a couple more? Or a way to make our own?) but it has issues with certain words like page, which it often automatically capitalizes or it will change "love" to "live" (or something similar).
lensixteen ratingthree Edit: Half the time, dragging for punctuation deletes the word I'm typing since JB update.
lentwentyfour ratingthree Some of the layout designs annoy me and it takes a long-press to activate voice typing which is frustrating when in a hurry.
lensix ratingone Worked a couple times before crashing.
lentwenty ratingone Now can't get beyond choosing English language download due to 'network error', no matter how good my connection is.
lensixteen ratingone The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous. Allow the option to turn it off.
lenten ratingthree Trying to type a username and the autocorrect changes it.
lennineteen ratingfour Good app but ever since my phone updated to jelly bean today, the keyboard has been a little laggy.
lentwentynine ratingfour And the hepatic feedback feels different than it did before. Even at 2ms I can feel it way more than I could before when it was at 7ms, which is inconvenient.
lenfifteen ratingfive And what's with not being able to put arrow keys on the tablet version?
lensixteen ratingfive I'd really like to see a winter/Christmas theme like they havr for Halloween though.
lentwentyone ratingfour Also doesnt have a feature to minimize the keyboard. I could not access a certain app one time because of this.
lenthirtysix ratingone so when I am typing a text, the auto correct lags behind then inserts the mistake repeatedly back to back. not only that, but by the time it catches up, it has already sent the message.
lensixteen ratingone additionally, in the chrome browser the keyboard won't let me type in the appropriate space.
lennine ratingfour I find myself constantly switching between LastPass & SwiftKey Keyboards. :-\
lenseventeen ratingfour Although it kinda Sucks how I had to pay for multiple Downloads for each of my devices.
lenthirteen ratingthree i like everything about this app with 1 (very significant) exception.no swipe feature.
lentwentythree ratingthree i am super-dependent on using swipe to enter words, so without that, there's no real point in me having this app.
lenfifteen ratingtwo It won't autocorrect my misspellings when set to inert a period with double space.
leneighteen ratingtwo when set to insert a prediction, will insert a random word whenever I use punctuation and then space.
lenten ratingfive the only problem i have is the themes, needs more.
lennine ratingfive The only issue I have is lack of themes.
lenfour ratingfive Also, no Japanese support!? ...
