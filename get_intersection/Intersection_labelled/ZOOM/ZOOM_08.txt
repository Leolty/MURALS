4&2018-09-26 01:40:18&And is GUI text control so sophisticated that the individual user cannot be given control of the size of the font for things to be readable still an open issue 
2&2021-09-19 06:30:41&I ve found suggestions to increase text size on the iPad and to put it in zoom mode 
5&2020-10-29 07:36:26&I need LARGER FONT Size

4&2018-09-26 01:40:18&The default sizing for the windows and text do not take into consideration people s differing needs 
3&2020-04-28 05:12:22&It would be much better to think through these frequent and important meeting controls and place them carefully on the screen and use larger fonts area please
