4&2020-08-26 00:18:53&The one thing missing for me is the ability to share files in a meeting s chat screen ON MOBILE DEVICES  
1&2020-06-10 08:58:34&With the iPad version the user has to use the cloud system to send files which is more complicated since not everybody in the meeting has a cloud account  
4&2020-08-26 02:43:34&I also wish it had a folder to pull images out of to share instead of my personal phone or computer
