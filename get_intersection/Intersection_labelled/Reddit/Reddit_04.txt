1&2018-09-17 18:58:06&Keep trying to click links in the comments section and it just hides the whole comment thread 
1&2021-11-06 12:00:21& I don t want to have to tap a link to expand more comments 
4&2019-04-10 10:37:38&Whenever a comment thread needs expanded to a second page or more when I click MORE COMMENTS the link is dead and I can t see anymore comments after that button 
3&2017-12-09 04:00:51&Clicking on links within a comment is annoyingly tedious sometimes 
3&2017-01-12 10:45:00& Cannot click on links in comments it upvotes the comment when I try to click it Lots of gifs and pics don t load 
3&2017-03-29 11:09:00&If someone hyperlinks in the comments it s also incredibly hard to click the link and view 
3&2017-03-07 13:06:00&The only problem is that links in comments are incredibly hard to tap 
1&2017-11-22 03:01:10&Whenever someone links something in the comments section I can t click on the link to open it 
3&2021-02-04 23:59:43&It s impossible to go get a link and paste it into a comment as it ll make the user comment to the entire post instead of a specific comment 
2&2019-05-13 01:40:25&I suggest that when you are writing a comment and you highlight a word and press the link button it automatically fills the highlighted word into the link so all you have to do is add the URL 
1&2019-04-04 00:47:28&It s hard to click on links that are on the last line of a comment which will bring up the gold screen the submenu or up downvote 
4&2017-02-10 03:49:00&Only issue is there are some minor kinks to work out like trying to click links and what not can close comments
