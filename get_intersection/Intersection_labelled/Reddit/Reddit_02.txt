4&2019-03-07 21:33:02&I have my comments set to sort by best but they often sort by new on most posts 
4&2018-01-30 00:46:00&I also don t know why we cannot sort comments by new anymore 
1&2019-01-04 04:36:17&It s infuriating choosing to sort by top comments in my preferences only for every thread to automatically sort by new comments 
4&2018-02-07 13:18:38& However one of the things I just noticed is the replacement of the new comment sorting with live it looks like it s something to update the thread automatically with new comments on top sure it may be a good idea for some threads but why not have both 
3&2018-01-30 05:00:39&Apparently you can t sort by new posts anymore 
1&2017-07-15 06:12:01&Also every comment page is sorted by likes 
1&2020-10-23 01:19:27&Since the recent update I can only sort comments for example in AITA by top best and new What happened to Q A and Controversial 
4&2017-04-06 12:11:06&But I really wish they would add the feature to sort comments by oldest to newes 
4&2021-07-12 08:05:34&Can we sort comments by old first please 
1&2017-12-11 03:25:43&I can t sort by new anymore 
1&2019-01-04 04:36:17&Why even ask my preference if it s just going to sort by new comments of the time anyways  
2&2019-01-04 07:22:10&It seems like every update rolls out a patch to fix an annoying batch of bugs and then a whole host of new ones pop up anyway the latest of which is the comments sorting by new even though I have too set as default
