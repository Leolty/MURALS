2&2021-05-05 00:32:19&I was in the midst of writing a lengthier post when I switched out to check a couple of facts in another app and when I switched back to the reddit app it popped back to my home screen and completely discarded the paragraphs that I had already written 
3&2021-11-06 09:48:12&Do you know how annoying it is to be two paragraphs into writing a long winded comment and then it just crashes on you and sends you to you phone s homescreen for no reason 
3&2017-02-05 10:38:00& Text gets cut off etc 
2&2021-04-07 10:04:07&It s difficult to scroll back up further in a message if you re typing a long message 
2&2017-12-31 12:38:07&Messages app has issues where the bottom message is cut out 
3&2021-09-07 15:20:42&The longer the post I write the more it lags 
1&2021-11-29 10:21:00&Don t use this app to write out anything longer than a tweet or it ll crash on you and delete what you wrote 
3&2018-05-23 03:31:39&When writing a message that is longer than the box the screen does not scroll to follow the words I am typing 
4&2017-05-09 15:40:36&When I m writing a post reply though the text I m replying to disappears which can be problematic
