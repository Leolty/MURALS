2&2020-04-03 03:14:33&Doesn t let me switch out of safe driving Mode when I m not driving any more 
2&2018-01-04 05:45:37&Its unacceptable that there is no way to turn off that automatic mandatory safe driving mode 
2&2018-01-04 05:45:37&I could understand if I was actually driving to have a safe driving mode 
4&2019-02-14 05:05:55&I just realized that the reason I wasn t able to turn my video off was the I had inadvertently set it up to safe driving mode 
3&2021-04-13 22:23:57&If you swipe into safe driving mode the sound cuts out 
1&2019-05-22 02:08:19&Zoom kept putting the webinar into safe driving mode and stopping the video despite me not moving nor even being in a car 
1&2019-04-10 04:38:45&I walked to my kitchen and video was lost saying something like Safe Driving Mode 
4&2017-01-14 13:15:00&I especially like the safe driving mode which puts a big mute unmute button on the screen 
5&2017-11-23 06:14:33&It even has a safe driving mode and integrates with our office conference rooms
4&2018-09-18 15:23:45&Zoom has a nice safe driving mode feature that lets you tap to talk if you dock your phone while you drive 
1&2020-06-21 05:34:38&Safe driver mode got turned in perhaps automatically causing a nearly min delay in the wedding all is well 
2&2020-05-12 22:06:20&using Zoom on my phone so I can still use my Computer Zoom setting goes into safe driving mode 
4&2018-09-18 15:23:45&Once a meeting is launched it should work just like the safe driving mode on the phone and let you mute hang up etc 
1&2017-11-09 01:02:19& I d like to like this but I can t use it while driving 
5&2020-05-11 05:35:25&They can even turn on your camera at anytime they feel like it keep safe and don t be a victim
1&2020-10-22 21:37:35&but not safe 
1&2020-04-09 06:23:05&ITS NOT SAFE
1&2020-04-15 04:33:37& Not safe
1&2020-04-13 20:25:43&ZOOM IS NOT SAFE 
4&2020-11-05 04:09:55&Zoom is very safe 
1&2020-04-21 12:48:40&I do not feel safe using zoom 
3&2021-04-23 06:45:22&Driving mode isn t great because I have to switch back and forth from screen share to this for easier unmute 
2&2020-05-04 02:21:10&Make it a lot safer 
2&2020-11-13 08:57:38&I try to go to settings and disable this but the disable option is locked 
5&2020-06-27 02:42:33&I like the safe driving area on the zoom meeting 
4&2019-03-20 21:19:22&Honestly I wish discord had the safe driving mode as I spend more time listening than talking I just wish I could look back at the chat log after my meeting was over 
4&2021-05-15 20:01:55&One of the slides is drivers mode 
2&2020-02-27 23:01:03& no way to access audio controls to turn on speakerphone during calls defaults to Driving Mode when I am sitting at home and don t even own a car no way to get out of the Settings screen without hitting cancel which does not actually cancel any changes you made this should be labeled done or similar defaults to hiding the mute hide toggles and other often used buttons Definitely NOT a well tested and refined UX 
3&2017-11-08 22:19:48&By default it puts you in driving mode where you are muted but if you swipe screens it automatically unmutes you 
1&2020-11-13 11:38:22&Even in driver safe mode without video a full battery drains to warning levels within one hour 
2&2020-05-04 02:21:10&And people are saying that it s not that safe 
1&2020-04-14 03:16:31&Zoom can turn on your camera whenever they please and they have access to any open windows so in these horrific times of Covid please uninstall this app so you can stay safe 
4&2021-08-17 10:33:11&Drive mode is very helpful
