3&2020-04-03 01:24:50&Meeting Settings did not help much 
2&2020-11-27 18:54:07&Where do I locate my personal meeting joined settings on my iPhone 
1&2020-08-18 21:27:06&I cannot join a zoom call without it telling me to put my personal meeting ID
1&2021-03-24 22:30:42&To join a meeting zoom is ok but to host a meeting it wants you to put in your personal ID 
5&2020-05-05 02:40:03&I have access to password protection for my meetings and can opt out of sharing information in the account settings 
1&2020-05-02 06:28:40&When I start a personal meeting and my invites try to sign on using my ID and password they are always told that they can t because I have another meeting running 
2&2020-04-19 07:28:43&Current app version will not allow you to change personal meeting ID password 
3&2020-06-14 22:58:29&Once the ID is entered there s a message that the host is conducting another meeting and it will not allow entrance 
3&2020-03-21 20:13:42&Joined mtg someone else set up default settings were such that I could not talk think I am set up now but there should be better instructions of settings before you join a meeting
4&2020-04-22 22:15:54&My only concern is that it disconnected me from my meeting because I changed the settings 
1&2019-12-05 00:29:23&Settings are non responsive to iPad requirements no way to join a meeting once logged off 
4&2020-07-16 00:34:59&I disabled having the mic on when entering the meeting in settings but it s a consistent problem that worries me whenever I enter a meeting 
1&2020-08-25 06:28:35&I dont host meeting on my own and now i have to keep going back on the provider i was setting up a meeting for 
3&2020-10-11 06:50:11&Several times this app dropped the connection to the meeting and did not give me an option to reconnect without reentering the meeting Id and password 
2&2019-05-12 22:36:12&The invitee is able to click on this link to be directed straight into the meeting no need to reapply the meeting ID
3&2020-09-30 04:03:55&When I put in the meeting ID I m prompted to sign in again 
2&2020-04-22 22:02:56&It appears that once someone accepts an invite the meeting ID and password are less accessible 
3&2020-04-08 23:58:57&However I have noticed that with the free app all meetings I schedule have the same meeting ID and the same password 
1&2021-02-10 10:20:20&Takes really long to type entire meeting ID user ID and once I m in the meeting it still prevents me from hearing by saying x number of members in the call 
1&2020-05-11 15:39:11&I hate that if I leave a meeting and don t remember the password but the meeting ID I still can t join
1&2020-05-13 09:20:32&It s impossible to adjust your settings during a meeting and you can t sign in to your account between meetings 
3&2021-10-01 02:32:54&It does not allow us to save the meeting room ID for future use 
3&2021-11-17 10:25:17&Who can enter a meeting ID
