1&2020-04-11 23:30:46&Significant audio issues when sharing only when sharing the screen on iPad 
4&2020-03-29 21:45:25&But on iOS devices I see no way to share background audio like you can on a PC 
3&2020-10-14 00:55:02&I couldn t share videos and sound 
4&2021-10-26 23:30:25&When I am sharing music from my iPad from YouTube the audio is not being shared I am going to look into setting maybe it s me 
5&2021-04-29 19:37:46&Screen sharing 
1&2021-12-28 10:23:59&Could you share your screen 
2&2020-06-03 00:07:54&There are bugs like sound coming through the main room when shared or not sharing 
4&2020-11-26 07:21:33&It s a good meeting app but sometimes the sound is weird like it sounds like my speaker is under water and screen share is fps
5&2018-10-24 12:10:12&screen sharing drawing on shared screen audio only vs audio and video etc all work well 
4&2021-08-22 02:25:15&Everything is good but improvement could be made for phones and tablets to allow viewing of more participants on the screen more options like to split audio to devices when sharing the screen 
1&2020-09-23 06:39:56&Screen sharing also causes duplicate audio until you turn it off every time 
3&2020-09-19 09:28:31&Screen sharing also causes duplicate audio until you turn it off every time 
4&2020-07-01 12:49:49&Also when I am on desktop I do not like how when I share my screen the audio does not come through 
4&2020-05-01 04:24:33& The audio is very clear and screen sharing is also coming together amazingly 
4&2020-05-17 06:08:59&I wish there was a better way to share screen with sound so u could show sound videos 
1&2020-07-11 04:04:18&Share video screen sound even though volume turned all the way up can hardly hear 
3&2020-05-17 10:26:09& I still cannot figure out how to share my screen or videos if I touch my screen during a video share the video and audio stop and I have to tap share which is very hard to even find on the screen 
3&2021-01-20 23:26:08&Someone will share their screen and you won t be able to hear what they are sharing and it will be all glitchy 
5&2021-04-13 21:11:21&There are video audio and screen sharing options 
5&2020-04-04 04:01:03&There are video audio and screen sharing options 
2&2018-12-13 00:47:43&Since we are demoing our apps we want to screen share the app as we would do with any Air Play technology 
5&2020-06-24 21:09:50&The sound and picture are clear and it s great to use when needing to share a screen for activities 
1&2019-03-30 04:55:33&I could get it to record audio but not to visual of the shared screen materials So frustrating 
4&2020-03-24 00:06:04&First I can t always share my screen from my iPad to my computer
