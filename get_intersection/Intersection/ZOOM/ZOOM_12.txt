4&2020-08-26 00:18:53&The one thing missing for me is the ability to share files in a meeting s chat screen ON MOBILE DEVICES 
4&2021-03-04 05:21:52&Third mobile people can t share as much a PC players so can you fix that 
1&2020-06-10 08:58:34&With the iPad version the user has to use the cloud system to send files which is more complicated since not everybody in the meeting has a cloud account 
4&2020-11-09 23:08:51&Great app but can you please add file share in chat on the mobile app 
5&2020-08-21 03:51:28&Also you can share a video document or whiteboard 
5&2020-11-05 10:37:59&I tried sharing from my iCloud Drive but the PowerPoint wasn t visible 
1&2021-05-28 01:36:18&The screen share on Zoom on Mobile devices is terrible 
4&2020-08-26 02:43:34&I also wish it had a folder to pull images out of to share instead of my personal phone or computer
