5&2019-06-27 12:00:43&All the content is shared seems to be controlled by the users rather than other sites like youtube and instagram
4&2020-03-23 08:50:45&I am able today but people have to have the Reddit app and pics videos and articles don t look the same as if I was to share a twitter post on Facebook as an example 
2&2019-10-23 12:01:24&Please allow to share images without linking to reddit the example being sharing to twitter 
1&2018-08-17 10:22:52&Why was it necessary to require users to send the Reddit link instead of direct sharing of gif s 
2&2019-12-10 02:41:51&They recently tinkered with the sharing options and you have to share the link instead of the picture like before 
1&2019-05-12 07:20:22&Now everything you share goes as a link if it s a NSFW image and you share with someone who doesn t own a Reddit account they wont be able to see
3&2017-12-12 23:58:09&Links shared through FB messenger through the reddit app won t work 
2&2017-12-06 01:50:57& Good app for the most part but the share function needs some fixing specifically the share to messenger 
3&2018-07-15 05:27:13&In the most recent version of the Reddit app when I try to share link it asks the person to download the Reddit app rather than show the content 
2&2018-07-15 00:00:37&It s pretty logical for a feature that has the word share in it to be in the Share menu but I guess someone in UX disagrees 
5&2018-12-17 17:04:35&You can choose which content to follow and not just what your friends are sharing 
5&2018-10-26 22:09:35&With all the new social media apps out there that produce instant gratification for people who post the same mundane photos videos stories etc 
1&2019-12-15 02:00:34&Sharing pictures constantly changes from sharing the image to sharing the image and a link or just the link to the post 
1&2019-05-12 05:35:46&I used to be able to share photos directly to messaging now the app tries to share a link so I have to download the image 
1&2017-05-26 09:57:36&I would rather take share and delete a screenshot instead of giving Reddit access to my camera and photos
