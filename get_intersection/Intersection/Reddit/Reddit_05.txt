1&2021-10-21 23:41:12&Every time keeps crashing when I post and then what s the point of drafts if you can t even save a draft 
4&2018-08-01 11:08:20&Also if you could add drafts option where we could save posts not ready to publish or whatever 
4&2019-11-09 16:37:42&Also I wish there was a Save Draft for creating posts or comments 
3&2020-01-23 05:28:32&I ve gotten to where I just make a draft of my comments in Notepad first so I can t lose them 
2&2021-02-05 00:06:32&Drafts do not exist even though it gives you an option to save them 
3&2019-02-18 06:47:25&Add a way to save drafts of a comment do you can check you have the right info before sending 
3&2017-06-05 01:13:48&Such as having drafts section and being able to delete private messages 
1&2019-12-02 19:09:59& gt I ve been trying to make a post on r AskScience for a while now hr gt If I switch between apps mid draft multitask for longer than like a minute when I switch back to my draft it goes to the Reddit logo loading screen then loads my home feed and I lose my draft 
4&2021-09-08 18:46:00&Please make saving drafts an option on the official Reddit app
4&2021-05-17 00:23:50&But one thing I would like to see improved is for a way to draft picture and video posts instead of discarding it completely 
4&2018-04-09 06:08:06&All that is visible is the comment being written which makes it difficult to write longer posts addressing multiple questions with no post to refer back to since there is no save to drafts for comments either 
4&2017-09-05 01:58:00&Similar to Apple s Mail app when replying to an email I can swipe down from the top the draft is tucked at the bottom of the screen and I can reference the email thread I am replying to 
1&2020-08-01 04:52:56&Find what you need swipe up to bring up Reddit only to find the draft you ve been typing away on for FOURTY MINUTES is gone because the app decided to refresh losing all the work you put into creating a post 
3&2019-02-02 10:05:56&Add back a drafts option when making a comment sometimes I need to stop typing and don t want to lose what I m typing
