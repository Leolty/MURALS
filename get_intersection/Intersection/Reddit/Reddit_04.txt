1&2018-03-01 07:44:33&I can t even click on links in comments anymore 
1&2017-04-18 03:49:14&if its about people not being able to click links then you need to make the hit box for links bigger not disable collapse comment on the comment body 
1&2017-02-08 12:14:00&if its about people not being able to click links then you need to make the hit box for links bigger not disable collapse comment on the comment body 
1&2018-09-17 18:58:06&Keep trying to click links in the comments section and it just hides the whole comment thread 
1&2021-11-06 12:00:21& I don t want to have to tap a link to expand more comments 
4&2019-04-10 10:37:38&Whenever a comment thread needs expanded to a second page or more when I click MORE COMMENTS the link is dead and I can t see anymore comments after that button 
3&2017-12-09 04:00:51&Clicking on links within a comment is annoyingly tedious sometimes 
3&2017-01-12 10:45:00& Cannot click on links in comments it upvotes the comment when I try to click it Lots of gifs and pics don t load 
3&2017-03-29 11:09:00&If someone hyperlinks in the comments it s also incredibly hard to click the link and view 
3&2017-03-07 13:06:00&The only problem is that links in comments are incredibly hard to tap 
1&2021-06-13 02:09:17&Doesn t make any sense Now in order to view comments we have to specifically click on the comments button as opposed to before when we could just click on the thread title 
1&2017-11-22 03:01:10&Whenever someone links something in the comments section I can t click on the link to open it 
4&2017-04-08 21:42:18& Could you please add the option to upload a photo into a comment instead of having to link from elsewhere 
3&2020-11-17 14:59:45&I ve been trying to click the comment button to see those other comment 
3&2021-02-04 23:59:43&It s impossible to go get a link and paste it into a comment as it ll make the user comment to the entire post instead of a specific comment 
2&2019-05-13 01:40:25&I suggest that when you are writing a comment and you highlight a word and press the link button it automatically fills the highlighted word into the link so all you have to do is add the URL 
1&2021-07-08 00:24:48&You have to click the comments button 
4&2017-04-05 01:49:52&Only have to click for comments 
1&2021-08-10 05:27:55&Then you click on the comments 
1&2019-04-04 00:47:28&It s hard to click on links that are on the last line of a comment which will bring up the gold screen the submenu or up downvote 
1&2018-02-28 22:43:10& They changed the comment collapse to a double click instead of single click 
1&2017-02-12 12:19:00& clicking links 
1&2018-06-18 00:17:33&Really clicks to get to my comments 
1&2017-12-21 01:20:18& Really clicks to get to my comments 
3&2021-01-30 06:59:00&And to get to the comments you have to click it from there 
3&2021-07-06 04:18:22&Having to click comments instead of swiping to them 
3&2019-11-18 05:49:36&I have to click on that to see the comments really 
4&2017-02-10 03:49:00&Only issue is there are some minor kinks to work out like trying to click links and what not can close comments 
2&2019-03-31 01:14:19&I also can t click links in text posts for some reason
