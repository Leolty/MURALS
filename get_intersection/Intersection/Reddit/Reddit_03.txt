4&2021-12-02 17:05:00&Good app but the most irritating thing is opening the app and it turns off your music because the audio gets stuck so you have to turn on audio and turn off I m on a video to fix it or else you can t listen to music and browse Reddit 
1&2018-09-29 09:31:30& When scrolling past a video in the reddit app it pauses my music even though the video doesn t play sound Please fix this

1&2018-05-08 02:21:58&In order to watch videos on this app I have to open them in YouTube because otherwise they have no audio except for when I pause and unpause them fifty times and even then it comes back for three seconds and goes back to silence 
1&2018-07-21 03:41:56&I refuse to use the app until they fix the fact that opening it up will pause any music or audio from playing anytime a video or even just a gif loads onto your screen even if you don t tap the video gif to view or hear it 
4&2019-04-29 08:22:18&I have to close and reopen the app almost every time I use it because videos will either pause and only play sound or they won t play at all 
1&2021-12-15 03:10:48&The above has not been fixed and lately if you open a video but don t finish watching it the audio will continue to play 
4&2018-12-24 14:47:31&Only gripe is that sometimes the videos will play the audio but the video will be frozen and I either have to reboot the app or leave the subreddit and return 
1&2021-10-01 09:27:51&Fix the mute button fix the audio auto play just fix your app already

3&2019-09-07 14:34:36&How about fixing the audio issues when viewing videos for those that uses reddit on the phone 
2&2021-07-18 22:55:16&And sound issues are abound regularly causing audio from my other apps to be overridden even when content is muted in the Reddit app 
2&2020-05-19 03:44:25&You have to force restart the app and it ll maybe play okay for a while then start pausing your videos again 
1&2021-08-23 12:17:26&Won t stop playing the audio of previous videos continues playing audio even if you ve left the app 
2&2021-11-30 23:03:47&The app is bugged whenever you play a video and exit out of it the audio continues to play and if you reopen the video again the audio will double up and overlap 
2&2020-07-22 21:06:52& Ever since the latest update I can t use the app for more than ten minutes before the app stops producing sound in videos or just not loading the videos at all Fix this
2&2020-09-01 21:23:17&If I m listening to music a podcast or audio book and Im browsing Reddit using this app the sound from whatever In listening to is interrupted every time I pass a video post on this app 
1&2020-08-28 03:24:43&I m not sure why but they insist on pausing whatever your listening whenever you open the app 
5&2017-05-31 09:05:35&Edit background music keeps pausing when I open the app

1&2018-05-23 01:24:53& All videos I try to watch get sound muted after seconds this is always a problem and has been a problem since the apps release 
3&2017-12-22 10:32:49&The Reddit media player will often freeze the video while the audio keeps playing with no way of getting the video started again aside from quitting the app altogether 
4&2017-12-21 20:06:02&This app is amazing it s great to access Reddit on my phone however the latest update has broken a few things like music pausing whenever you scroll across a GIF which is really irritating 
2&2018-10-14 14:03:45&App has started playing sound on videos even when I ve turned the volume all the way off on my phone very disruptive
