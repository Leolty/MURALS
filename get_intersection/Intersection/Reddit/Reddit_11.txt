1&2018-07-22 07:01:37&Why can t this app remove that group 
1&2021-01-14 06:30:00&The app is crashing when opening a dm and there s no way to delete group chats you ve been invited to 
1&2021-07-18 02:50:20&Admin controls the conversation deletes the comments shapes the community instead of people in the group 
3&2021-05-17 01:13:07&I can t start chats with new people 
4&2019-04-25 19:28:51&The part I hate is if one person complains cause they don t agree with your point of view you can be band from that group chat you were on 
1&2021-01-14 06:30:00&Also why can t you guys make it easier to delete chats 
2&2020-11-13 10:55:14&App is great but I hate that my group chats always crash if too many people message and I don t open them right away 
1&2020-12-02 11:30:57&These chats are private and between people who should be able to say what they want in private chat that shouldn t be monitored or be able to get you banned 
2&2021-10-21 18:18:06&Why can we chat with other users
2&2019-01-10 21:06:24&Direct chat isn t working again too
3&2020-11-06 04:42:45&Will be awesome to have the ability to group subreddits and being able to put a name to such user made group 
4&2020-03-24 10:01:17& Will be awesome to have the ability to group subreddits and being able to put a name to such user made group 
3&2021-01-06 23:55:55&Also it s hard to send a post to someone via message not chat 
1&2019-12-19 03:17:04& Either let me dismiss recommended chat rooms or get rid of that entire panel in the chat room tab 
3&2020-04-13 05:54:26&Or they ll remove your post and say please message the moderators of this sub if you have questions and then ban your ability to message them when you actually do 
2&2019-03-05 11:24:09&We should be able to sort search and even delete the ever accumulated chat messages we get 
1&2018-10-25 20:35:42&I have screenshots of chats I have had with these moderators where they say they are justified for deleting certain comments that go against their beliefs for breaking their respective subreddit rules but then turning a blind eye to other comments that are in favor of their views 
5&2019-06-17 11:59:06&The only thing I think y all should change is to be able to delete chats and messages 
1&2021-12-04 18:34:13&What is the purpose of opting out of chat if people can still force you into chat via awards 
2&2017-11-16 07:16:04&Get rid of the chat stop with the profiles and be the reddit that you were 
3&2020-10-25 04:45:58&I ve been a Reddit user for years and never want to chat on Reddit please remove the chat icon or make it optional
