4&2019-03-07 21:33:02&I have my comments set to sort by best but they often sort by new on most posts 
4&2018-01-30 00:46:00&I also don t know why we cannot sort comments by new anymore 
1&2019-01-04 04:36:17&It s infuriating choosing to sort by top comments in my preferences only for every thread to automatically sort by new comments 
1&2020-10-24 23:44:27&How do you sort through s of comments 
4&2018-02-07 13:18:38& However one of the things I just noticed is the replacement of the new comment sorting with live it looks like it s something to update the thread automatically with new comments on top sure it may be a good idea for some threads but why not have both 
3&2018-01-30 05:00:39&Apparently you can t sort by new posts anymore 
1&2017-07-15 06:12:01&Also every comment page is sorted by likes 
1&2020-10-23 01:19:27&Since the recent update I can only sort comments for example in AITA by top best and new What happened to Q A and Controversial 
4&2017-04-06 12:11:06&But I really wish they would add the feature to sort comments by oldest to newest 
2&2021-07-01 11:00:55&Now comments are hidden under a drawer of sorts 
1&2017-05-31 14:58:43&It sorted messages comments and post replies separately 
4&2018-12-02 03:59:21&Comment section is kinda hard to tell between new threads of comments new ideas 
1&2020-11-09 23:59:11& Removed sort comments by controversial on mobile app 
4&2021-07-12 08:05:34&Can we sort comments by old first please 
1&2017-12-11 03:25:43&I can t sort by new anymore 
1&2019-01-04 04:36:17&Why even ask my preference if it s just going to sort by new comments of the time anyways 
1&2021-07-10 04:54:06&I can t view comments anymore without them appearing like the live feed used to 
4&2017-05-31 11:11:26&I m able to set comments to sort this way why not the posts themselves 
4&2018-04-30 03:03:34&Please add an option to pause live comments 
4&2017-10-14 01:57:15& Basically I m a little annoyed that I can t sort a users comments 
2&2020-05-23 20:29:03& After this new update I cannot leave comments on posts 
2&2019-01-04 07:22:10&It seems like every update rolls out a patch to fix an annoying batch of bugs and then a whole host of new ones pop up anyway the latest of which is the comments sorting by new even though I have too set as default 
1&2021-01-30 23:05:21&Clicking once more on the icon brings up the comments can t sort can t skip to next thread 
3&2017-08-26 19:13:20&Why do I want to read through minutes of comments that are mediocre to then sort by top and all the best comments are now sitting unread at the top
