3&2018-09-18 04:25:51&My Pandora stations are changing all the time and why can t we just ask Siri to play any station we want similar to how you can ask Alexa to play any Pandora station 
1&2021-11-15 20:30:26&Even if you ask Siri to play a podcast verbally your phone will ask the app to play it and it will default back to shuffle radio 
1&2017-03-12 07:22:00&Problem is I didn t ask for Pandora to play 
2&2021-06-02 10:07:23&FYI I can use Siri to play Apple Music and Spotify with my phone locked 
3&2020-06-14 10:54:08&You say Hey Siri resume Pandora and that idiot will play some random station just on a whim 
2&2018-01-10 18:35:09&New car worked for months and it just stopped working had to ask Siri to open Pandora than it would play sometimes 
1&2017-11-15 14:22:43&I sometimes ask Siri for assistance to Play Pandora but only an error message sometimes is shown on the phone s screen with Siri claiming nothing can be done 
4&2021-07-30 02:21:02&Pandora let s me listen to music
