3&2017-12-06 12:07:27& If it had iPhone X support then I would be glad to add two more stars to this review but it does not have iPhone X support so two stars are not sent to the people who make Pandora Music 
4&2017-11-22 06:13:28&Since I ve gotten the Iphone X I constantly have to close it and restart it 
2&2017-11-07 23:00:09&Also needs to be iPhone X compatible because the app doesn t fill all the screen 
2&2017-12-08 05:15:08&Yeah it would be nice if you updated the app to support the screen size of the iPhone X Pandora has had a few updates since the launch of the iPhone X but still looks terrible since there are large black gaps on the top and bottom 
1&2020-05-31 00:48:00&Keeps crashing phone iphone xs max 
1&2017-12-01 11:50:02&Update Recent update still does not address unresponsive play pause button and still no iPhone X support

1&2017-11-08 16:34:22&It would also be nice to see an update to support the iPhone X display to get rid of those ugly black bars 
1&2017-11-08 09:54:00&It would also be nice to see an update to support the iPhone X display to get rid of those ugly black bars 
3&2018-01-06 09:19:45&Additionally it would be nice to see iPhone X support 
1&2017-11-17 00:26:22& This app is the only one that causes my iPhone X to crash 
2&2017-12-15 04:08:33&Still doesn t support iPhone X or scrubbing from the lock screen control center widget

3&2017-12-12 11:52:02& The app does not fit the display of the iPhone X please fix 
1&2017-11-08 12:07:10&You updated the app and still no support for the new iPhone is unacceptable 
1&2019-06-03 00:57:16&I have iPhone xs max Sorry for any trouble you re experiencing 
1&2017-12-12 13:02:42&It s bad enough the app cknstantkky freezes and crashes but I lay monthly and they can t even optimize the app for the iPhone X 
3&2019-10-05 11:10:50&changes don t seem like iPhone XR 
3&2017-12-23 08:10:13&The adds are constantly annoying and it s really concerning that an app this popular still has not updated their app to fit the iPhone X screen 
1&2017-11-17 05:45:12& This app for some reason still isn t updated or optimized for the iPhone X I am not sure what s taking Pandora so long to do so or if they even intend on doing so but if not I will be deleting this app 
3&2018-05-12 04:11:30&I am very disappointed with how pandora is working with my IPhone X I checked my location to see what is going on however my service is fine 
3&2017-12-21 14:27:57&Please update to support iPhoneX and it s new technologies that work with iPhoneX OLED display 
1&2017-12-20 06:01:04&The app is so buggy it s gets stuck and needs to be restarted very often Also when are you guys gonna update for iPhone X full screen
