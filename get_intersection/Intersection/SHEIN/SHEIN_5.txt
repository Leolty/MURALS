4&2019-07-22 01:31:48&I do wish they had a better search option where you could search a particular color or name of the color so that you could find all of the matching items for another item that you ve already picked out in your cart 
5&2021-08-04 19:16:16&There are a lot of styles and the colors have been true to what they show in the pictures 
5&2021-08-22 20:16:59&Also I LOVE the color feature that you Don t have to go into an item to see available colors 
5&2020-01-03 03:57:25&Only minor problem I have is that sometimes I look at a clothing item but I cannot choose a different color sometimes I check the reviews and see the clothing in a different color but for some reason cannot change it 
4&2021-04-12 06:18:56&Products received have mostly been good but lots of time the fabric isn t what s shown and the color is off 
4&2020-08-06 05:16:41&I would love to see a greater variety in colors because for the most styles that compliment only come in one select color 
5&2021-11-03 18:30:22&The colors are true to the photos shown 
2&2021-08-18 08:26:03&right now it shows the color of a product on top of every review and no size info m s L it s important information thank you shein
5&2021-06-25 10:40:18& This couldn t be any easier to use shop by color size style enter your needs and bam Tons of options to choose from 
4&2021-07-04 21:17:16&Y all have too many shoppers of color with unique bodies that post all on Instagram and tag y all 
4&2021-04-12 06:18:56& It would be nice to see actual product photos accompanied with the styled photo gives a truer visual of what you re actually purchasing 
4&2017-03-12 05:39:00&I would really like to see that I could at least use the products on my wish list for this if not just allowing us to use every product 
1&2021-12-21 05:23:14&Nothing looks like the sample colors 
4&2020-07-10 04:05:09&SHEIN is a very nice shopping app but I would just like you guys to show how the products Actually look Cause some are wayyy smaller than they show in the picture pls don t edit it so much and if it s a small product like a carpet it s okay don t make it look huge in the picture because that could just make people buy you re products less 
5&2020-08-04 23:35:34&If multiple color options are available it only says color 
4&2021-07-08 15:36:02&I love hunting down the styles and colors that I want to add to my wardrobe
