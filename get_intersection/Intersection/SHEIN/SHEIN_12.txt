5&2021-04-30 04:22:44&They do flash sales they have options for types of things for example if I want a white lacy shirt there s many many many options to choose from 
3&2020-11-28 10:52:08&I use the filter button to find and delete sold out items 
4&2021-12-29 12:37:13&I wish the search function worked better or they had more filters to get more refined results 
5&2020-03-26 05:42:55& and last I like that they have daily flash sales sometimes games for you to win points and love when they have their free shipping no minimum opportunities 
1&2021-02-20 02:05:28&If I filter for a certain size then there should be no reason I am seeing products that are not that size or that are out of stock 
4&2019-12-20 10:54:32&The only thing I would like to see is more sales 
4&2021-08-15 05:19:24&This is a great shopping app the only issue I have when searching for an item and filtering e g 
1&2020-08-13 11:36:52&On multiple occasions I have noticed that for their Flash Sale there is a much smaller variety for plus size than for the smaller sizes 
3&2021-04-12 02:46:06&I don t like the new updates new items are harder to sort I liked it before you could sorted by item easier 
5&2021-06-12 13:28:51&With features like add to wishlist from your cart filtering reviews with pics showing similar items at the bottom of the product page accuracy size chart 
4&2020-12-29 11:11:05&This would allow me to look at the app every day and filter to see what new stuff was added without having to search through all the other new in items I saw the day before and days prior etc 
1&2019-10-22 05:19:29&Filter for sizes XXS and only items pop up 
5&2018-05-25 07:17:00&Comments rating product photos search filters 
4&2021-12-24 20:55:08&Filters are missing some size options and recommended items which appear under each item s product page don t have an add to favorites icon 
4&2019-03-28 11:03:54&I like this shopping app Easy to navigate through Sale sections are easy to find Plenty to look through Only down fall is I see a lot of the same items in my feed a lot for bottoms at least otherwise dope Hello thanks for your kindly suggestion
