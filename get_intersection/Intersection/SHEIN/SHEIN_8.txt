5&2021-11-28 08:11:05&For example I will be trying to find a specific type of shoe style but when I search it up it doesn t even show shoes 
5&2020-04-25 20:44:26&Where you can upload a photo of something trendy in the search bar and see what styles come up 
5&2021-04-25 02:30:12&I feel like adding an option to where you can search by photo sort of like google would be veryyy helpful 
5&2021-02-09 11:22:56&They have every style and trend and you can search trend style in search bar 
4&2021-12-29 12:37:13&I wish the search function worked better or they had more filters to get more refined results 
4&2021-05-24 01:14:37&I also would like to say that sometimes the search results aren t always accurate 
3&2021-08-20 02:02:49&Even if I search for something specific most of the recommendations it shows me are related to other things I ve clicked on before 
4&2021-08-12 05:49:18&but when i search something up it doesn t show what i searched for and the reviews aren t very helpful
3&2021-08-20 02:02:49&It recommends based on the things you click the most but personally I m trying to find new items and styles to try so I m sick of seeing the same stuff over and over again 
5&2020-05-17 05:38:05&They upload s of new styles for every taste daily so you re bound to find something you love 
1&2021-05-24 21:51:26&The ads show such cute clothes but once I m browsing I can t find anything that isn t the same repeated pattern style and boring 
4&2021-07-08 15:36:02&I love hunting down the styles and colors that I want to add to my wardrobe 
4&2020-06-08 16:26:07&Sometimes when I type in simple words it says it can t find what I m looking for 
5&2021-01-03 04:07:40&I am so in move with this site because they have trendy shoes in my size and they have really all type of style in my size as well and the search is inclusive meaning you can search by many combinations and not lose any entries 
5&2019-12-04 05:06:52&i would really like to see an update where all of your liked items are separated by category dresses tops purses etc so that it s easier to search for specific items 
5&2021-08-23 02:11:08&i just have one request i wish that when you search up certain styles aesthetics even like alt indie and even kawaii i wish more would show up 
4&2020-08-30 07:31:01&Instead of having to scroll through everything to find an item similar to the one you like
