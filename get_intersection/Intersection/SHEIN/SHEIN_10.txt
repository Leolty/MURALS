5&2019-04-05 19:49:10& Pleaseee help make a function to delete comments on designs 
5&2021-07-11 04:44:29&let me comment on other comments i m begging you
5&2020-09-12 11:47:32&Make sure to read of course comments and description 
5&2021-04-27 02:35:01&And another helpful thing I like is that on the reviewing you can translate the words they use in any language but the only thing I absolutely can not stand is that it takes forever to get to you 
5&2020-06-20 13:13:33&Now I know to read the comments and look at images 
2&2018-02-10 07:41:35&Just add comment because the app ask to do 
5&2018-05-25 07:17:00&Comments rating product photos search filters 
4&2018-12-05 00:39:27&On the comments that have pictures though those are usually awesome 
3&2021-06-17 03:27:35&You can t report these comments so the whole thing is a mess 
3&2021-08-12 08:02:42&For some of the products I m now looking back and rereading a few of the comments 
5&2021-05-28 10:31:11&I rely on the comments to decide whether I want to buy something or not usually a piece of clothing will have hundreds of comments and each comment comes with the commenters measurements size and color they choose and picture of them wearing the outfit not all comments have pictures but a lot do so you can get a REALLY good idea if it ll fit your body type and if you ll like it or not chances are at least a handful of people who comment have similar measurements as you do so it s really helpful 
1&2020-06-11 02:23:06&System won t allow you to comment on the ones you have already decided to return 
3&2019-12-29 23:34:17&A translator button would be so helpful
