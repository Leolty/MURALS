4&2021-08-11 03:58:28&When using this you select the things you want to delete abd then you delete them 
5&2020-08-03 05:19:21&The recommendations under each item you view show clothes that really fit your viewing history 
5&2019-01-23 11:43:19&My only complaint is that when I go to add something to my wishlist it shows that I have the recently added items there but if I exit out of the app and go back in the wishlist doesn t save any of the new things I added yet they show up in Recently Viewed 
5&2019-04-05 19:49:10& Pleaseee help make a function to delete comments on designs 
4&2020-09-10 02:55:35&My suggestion is that on top of a list view there is also a panel or block view to make it less bulky and more concise 
5&2019-03-30 07:38:16&Edit Delete Share
5&2019-06-20 21:54:11&Only complaint about the app is I have to actually click on the item from my wishlist and unLOVE unClick the heart button to remove it compared to on the browser where I can easily remove from wishlist 
5&2018-08-03 02:10:54&The app looks nice and clean and is very organized and it doesn t shut down or glitch very much although one annoying thing is that my saved for later does automatically scroll back up to the top after I click to look at a specific item in it 
3&2020-11-28 10:52:08&I use the filter button to find and delete sold out items 
4&2020-04-27 03:42:51&You could view and compare without having to exit that page and view your measurements on your profile 
4&2020-05-24 10:35:38&it s really nice to be able to save clothing that you like for later and it not get erased when you have the app and not just on a website 
4&2017-09-14 19:24:55&Needs some fixing with loading the pages of the saved items it always takes you back up every time you enter a photo view 
5&2020-03-22 22:11:48&The only thing I don t like is that when things get sold out I have to go through my favorites and delete them and once you scroll and click on an item then you go back to the favorites page and it starts all over again 
4&2018-08-21 02:58:57&But one problem with the app that I ve always hated is that whenever I click on one of my SAVED ITEMS just to view it or whatever and then when I click back to the normal profile page it also resets itself and starts the beginning of my saved items list 
2&2020-07-19 07:33:05&Do not delete the app DELETE THE ACCOUNT 
3&2018-07-01 11:59:23&i really like the app it has lots of stylish yet affordable clothing lines but i wish there was an editing option for the saved items i wanna reorder and remove some stuff more easily and maybe put them in folders so that i can access what i want faster
1&2020-05-23 14:34:50&Every time I try to go to the settings where the delete button is it disappears in less than a matter of seconds 
2&2020-05-23 13:56:00&Did anyone experience the delete account option disappearing when you click on account security or is it just me 
1&2021-07-25 16:25:42&A girl got her information on the dark web thanks to sheik delete your account please be safe on apps
1&2021-01-13 23:30:08&I will delete this app and never look back
