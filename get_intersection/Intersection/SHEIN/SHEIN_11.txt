5&2020-01-10 13:55:18&It s easy to find what you re looking for with the search bar and the links to products from finding sneakers in a size to the daily new products that have been launched 
4&2018-04-17 07:22:36&Also we have no search button so I can t search any particular items I m looking for 
2&2021-05-03 13:00:51&You also will never be able to see al products within a category no matter what because exact products are worded differently to mix up user searches 
2&2019-06-23 00:46:55&If I want to buy my wishlist items I will go into my wishlist not the new products section 
5&2020-07-16 06:42:31&The only thing I d say is that if you re looking for something specific search around on the site for a while because they have multiple of the same products but some are even cheaper 
4&2021-12-29 12:37:13&I wish the search function worked better or they had more filters to get more refined results 
5&2021-06-12 13:28:51&With features like add to wishlist from your cart filtering reviews with pics showing similar items at the bottom of the product page accuracy size chart 
4&2019-12-21 20:33:51&I browse the new items daily 
4&2021-12-24 20:55:08&Filters are missing some size options and recommended items which appear under each item s product page don t have an add to favorites icon 
2&2020-02-19 01:41:19&There s no option to do so and I still have my products in the cart but can t search for clothes Hi 
3&2017-05-14 06:31:32&The search bar doesn t work very well but the clothes and accessories are great and unique 
5&2020-12-23 02:23:45&Even when I don t have something in particular I m looking for I can scroll and find many new items 
4&2017-08-31 02:07:21&It s very annoying because I have to search all over creation to find the items again 
4&2019-07-22 01:31:48&I do wish they had a better search option where you could search a particular color or name of the color so that you could find all of the matching items for another item that you ve already picked out in your cart 
1&2017-10-16 04:22:18&There are no search parameters to help guide your search either just basic categories 
3&2021-08-20 02:02:49&Even if I search for something specific most of the recommendations it shows me are related to other things I ve clicked on before 
5&2018-05-03 19:25:42&I don t always have time to search for something stylish within my budget 
4&2017-02-26 23:25:00&This drives me crazy because when you click on a item and you scroll down it says you may also like then it shows tons of items but if you were shopping in a category then it takes you out of it because of this I m have to close the app then relaunch it AGAIN but if there was a back button then this app would be the absolute BEST 
5&2020-07-21 02:09:34&You don t have to search for them 
4&2021-01-13 02:15:50&There s also the search 
5&2020-08-15 10:58:49&There s also the search 
4&2021-08-12 05:49:18&but when i search something up it doesn t show what i searched for and the reviews aren t very helpful
5&2021-04-25 02:30:12&I feel like adding an option to where you can search by photo sort of like google would be veryyy helpful 
5&2019-12-04 05:06:52&i would really like to see an update where all of your liked items are separated by category dresses tops purses etc so that it s easier to search for specific items 
3&2020-03-25 03:59:07&Meanwhile we suggest you choose our new products because we always update the latest fashion
4&2019-06-25 03:22:50& People need to be able to search for topics like infant clothes or workout shoes without getting a page that says no results 
5&2019-12-11 23:49:09&There is also a Free Trial Center where you are able to submit applications for specific products for a chance to be selected to try out those products FOR FREE and leave reviews for them and as you leave reviews for products you rack up points
